[xpost] AMA and discussion about a new AI that will help provide resources to posters in r/legaladvice on Friday, 11/20 at 4pm ET/1PM PT
The AMA is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/jxbny2/ai\_comes\_to\_la\_ama\_and\_discussion\_about\_a\_new\_ai/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/jxbny2/ai_comes_to_la_ama_and_discussion_about_a_new_ai/)

 \-----------

Big News. We are launching an AI and we will be hosting an AMA to explain what is going on.

**The AI**: Locationbot will have a new friend - the Reddit Eviction help bot.

The Eviction Help Bot uses the legal issue spotter [Spot](https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/) which was initially developed by the Suffolk Law School [Legal Innovation &amp; Technology Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/) in conjunction with Stanford Law School's [Legal Design Lab](https://law.stanford.edu/organizations/pages/legal-design-lab/). ***Spot is essentially an "AI" or "learning Machine" which was developed using questions and answers posted right here on*** [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/). The questions were then run through a [game played by law students and other legal professionals](https://learnedhands.law.stanford.edu/).  In the course of this game the players taught Spot to identify legal  issues when they were written in normal conversational English by  regular OPs.

The bot is deployed when Spot identifies a message or a question on [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)  to be related to housing. If the legal issue in a message is identified  as a housing issue, then the bot responds by referring the user to the [legalfaq platform](https://legalfaq.org/).  Legal FAQ provides users with jurisdiction specific information  regarding eviction on a local, state and federal level. The platform  functions as a ‘front door’, it provides users basic orientation on  their rights and then hands them off to service providers who can help  them.

Because Spot is a learning  machine as there are more interactions with it, it will grow smarter and  be better able to help people looking for legal assistance.

**The AMA**

On  Friday, November 20th at 4pm ET/1PM PT members of Stanford's Legal  Design Lab,  Suffolk's Legal Innovation and Technology Lab, and yours  truly will answer any questions you may have about this bot, legal AI in  general, how learning machines work, and anything else that strikes  your fancy.

From Stanford Law School in Palo Alto California:

* Margaret  Hagan: Margaret Hagan is the Executive Director of the Stanford Legal  Design Lab, working to bring law &amp; design together. Margaret holds a  JD from Stanford Law, as well as an AB from the University of Chicago,  an MA from Central European University in Budapest, and a PhD from  Queen’s University Belfast in International Politics.
* Nóra  Al Haider: Nóra Al Haider is the Lab’s Policy and Design Lead. She is  interested in combining the fields of law, tech and design to find  human-centred solutions for complex problems. Nóra holds a Bachelor  (honours) and Research Master in Law from Utrecht University.
* Metin  Eskili: Metin Eskili is the Lab’s developer and technologist. He is a  full-stack developer who builds access to justice technology for us to  implement and research. Metin holds a bachelor degree in computer  engineering from Turkey.

From Suffolk Law School in Boston, Massachusetts:

* David  Colarusso, Director of the Legal Innovation and Technology Lab. David  Colarusso is the Director of Suffolk University Law School's Legal  Innovation and Technology Lab. An attorney and educator by training, he  has worked as a public defender, data scientist, software engineer, and  high school physics teacher.
* Quinten  Steenhuis, Clinical Fellow. Steenhuis is a clinical fellow in the Legal  Innovation and Technology Lab. Quinten has practiced housing and  eviction defense law since 2008, and has been a professional programmer  and web application developer since 2001. He speaks at area law schools  and blogs frequently on the topic of legal technology. He works on  projects addressing social justice and access to justice with technology  focusing on the topic of housing and evictions.

In  light of the late Friday nature of the AMA I'm going to leave this post  up for any questions starting now and they will be answered starting  Friday at 4pm ET/1pm PT. Feel free to post your questions or comments  below.

I am walking around the world with my dog. AMA!
Five years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a twenty-five thousand mile, seven continent, walk around the world. After four months of walking I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hQXuQhhpg/), and since then we've covered 16,500 miles across thirty-three countries together.

When Savannah was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart. Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running circles at night. We’ve spent nearly every minute of every day together and from navigating chaotic cities and strange new environments Sav and I are totally in sync. She’s my best bud and absolutely rock solid. (The Dodo recently did [a video on her](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NdSwnAVtK/).)

I'm walking around the world because of a friend who died at seventeen. Her death led me to understand how fleeting my life was and that I needed to make the most of the short time I had. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around the world stuck in my head as a way to live a full life.

From seventeen to twenty-six I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility.

During the first two years of this adventure I walked from New Jersey to Uruguay. I was held up at knife point in Panama, did ayahuasca in the Amazon, and climbed 15,000 feet over the Chilean Andes. The three years since walking The Americas, I was [almost taken out](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/photos/a.382245018625792/870555439794745/?type=3&amp;theater) by a bacterial infection, needed seven months to recover, then walked Europe, North Africa, across Turkey and into Georgia. I peregrinated The Camino in Spain, had a twenty-four hour police escort through Algeria, visited the village of my family name (Turčić) in Croatia and became the first private citizen granted permission to cross the Bosphorus Bridge on foot (the Istanbul bridge crosses from Europe to Asia).

After flying home this winter to obtain extended visas for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Savannah and I returned to the road this March but were promptly forced to put our walk on hold. Currently we're in lockdown in Baku, Azerbaijan so I thought this would be the perfect moment for an AMA.

This [infographic](http://theworldwalk.com/infographic/) on my site provides a great visualization of our walk.

And [this video](https://www.facebook.com/Sunrise/videos/311540596150551/) from Sunrise Australia provides the best summation of our journey.

If you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos daily and write a weekly(ish) blog post.

I am [Jaron Hunter](https://angel.co/u/jaron-hunter), Founder of [AdMail](https://admail.app/), a membership based service for people who would like companies to stop filling their mailbox with paper junk mail. Even if you love junk mail, feel free to ask me anything!

It’s hard to imagine there not being enough paper to make essential products such as toilet paper, napkins, paper towels, etc., but that is exactly what’s happening currently as we battle Covid-19. The last time there was a [toilet paper shortage](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/johnny-carson-tp-shortage/), it was Johnny Carson’s fault. This time, it’s our fault.

This is how I came up with the idea of AdMail, as there really shouldn’t be any shortage for paper products that are essential to American households when billions of paper ads are sent to households every year. Unfortunately, many of these paper ads either end up in the recycle bin, trash can, or in the junk mail pile in the corner of the house. It’s up to us to take responsibility and stop the wasteful use of paper for junk mail so trees can either be saved, or used to create more essential items such as toilet paper. Through AdMail, people can send a clear message that junk mail is no longer welcomed at their house. How do you feel about junk mail? Would you rather get paper ads, or digital ads?

Hi, I’m Samuel M. Katz, author, consultant, lecturer, and a man of many miles traveled. I have written twenty-plus books and hundreds of articles that have been translated into over a dozen languages. AMA!
I’m a New York Times best-selling author, magazine editor, and special feature correspondent, lecturer, and consultant. I have written twenty-plus books and hundreds of articles that have been translated into over a dozen languages. My recent books include: *Under Fire: The Untold Story of the Attack in Benghazi*, *The Ghost Warriors: Inside Israel’s Undercover War on Suicide Terror*, the National and Los Angeles Times bestselling *Harpoon: Inside The Covert War against International Terrorism’s Money Masters*, and, *Beirut Rules: The Murder of a CIA Station Chief and Hezbollah’s War against America.*

My newest book is *No Shadows in the Desert: Murder, Espionage, and Vengeance in the War Against ISIS*, published by Hanover Square Press. It is the untold and inside story of the daring war against the so-called Islamic State and how Jordan’s General Intelligence Department, the GID, dispatched the best spies in the region to spearhead a campaign of retribution to terminate the commanders of ISIS who were responsible for the capture, torture, and filmed immolation of a young F-16 pilot who was seized over Raqqa. The Jordanian campaign—conducted alongside the CIA, other arms of the U.S. intelligence community, and an international coalition—eliminated the commanders of the Islamic State’s army and helped expedite the military victory against the Caliphate.

I’m Tom Pallini, an aviation reporter with Business Insider. In June, I took 7 flights on the US’ top 4 airlines including American, Delta, United, and Southwest to see what it’s like to fly on each of them during the pandemic and if social distancing in the skies is real. Ask me anything!
As an airline reporter for [Business Insider]https://www.businessinsider.com/author/thomas-pallini), I’ve been following along with the changes that the major US airlines have been making since the pandemic began but after one airline was caught not following its own policy, I decided to take to the skies for myself. I flew 7 flights in total, including one flight on [Delta Air Lines](https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-on-american-and-delta-during-a-pandemic-comparison-2020-6), two flights on [American Airlines](https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-on-american-and-delta-during-a-pandemic-comparison-2020-6), two flights on [United Airlines](https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-on-southwest-and-united-during-covid-19-pandemic-comparison-2020-6), and two flights on [Southwest Airlines](https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-on-southwest-and-united-during-covid-19-pandemic-comparison-2020-6). The experiences have been unlike anything I've seen before in a lifetime of flying with each airline having its own way of handling the pandemic. No two airlines have been exactly alike on any of my journeys, and seemingly ever-changing policies are creating confusion for passengers.
 
I summed up the experience [in this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-expect-when-flying-on-united-american-delta-southwest-during-pandemic-comparison-2020-7). Now, I’m ready to share anything and everything about my flights.

I'm David Kim, a community organizer running for U.S. Congress to represent Los Angeles - California's 34th Congressional District
My name’s David Kim. I’m running to represent California’s 34th district in the U.S. House of Representatives in hopes of bringing solutions that build a floor to stand on for all Americans. Prior to campaigning full time, I was an immigration attorney defending those seeking asylum and citizenship against the brutal unfairness and inefficiency of our current system. 

I’m the son of immigrants and I learned from an early age how important it is to serve my community. My parents are pastors, and I spent my childhood days helping church members who couldn’t speak English by translating their calls to the phone company. Since then, my life experience has been one of purpose and service. I truly love helping others--in fact, I’ve found I tget bored working on anything that doesn’t! 

My hope is to add support to Congress’s biggest ideas: Universal Basic Income, Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and a Homes Guarantee, along with Immigration and Campaign Finance reform. Yes, these are several massive ideas. However unlike my opponent, who is backed by almost a million dollars from corporate PACs and large donors, I do not plan on entering Congress only to offer a million tiny non-solutions. 

I want to fight for the massive changes that will build our nation a foundation for a stable, healthy future. I want to fix the financial, medical, and housing insecurities that I saw growing up. I want to heal the anxiety that comes from knowing one small decision, one unexpected event can lead some families to a lifetime of crushing debt and struggle. 

Yes, it sounds like a lot, and maybe it sounds overly serious to you. But you know what, the past few years have proven that government should be serious. And compassionate. And human. 

Speaking of, included here is a picture that proves I *am* human https://i.imgur.com/Z6q0i82.jpeg. So, without further ado…

We're VICE News Senior correspondent, Isobel Yeung and London Bureau Chief, Sean Stephens who have been reporting from inside Lombardy, the epicenter of Italy's coronavirus outbreak. AMA.
Italy was the first Western country to detect a mass coronavirus outbreak. To date, 169,000 have been infected and over 22,000 have died. As countries like the US and UK look to Italy for signs of hope, we spent time in Lombardy to see how they're getting on.

We spent a shift with EMTs, gained access to an ICU ward and witnessed the overwhelming number of dead being taken away for cremation. What we saw was an up-close look at a country still reeling from a human catastrophe. With the unofficial numbers much higher than the official death toll and the likelihood of a total lifting off the lockdown still very far off, Italians are suffering through a collective trauma that they're only just beginning to process.

I'm Jordan Mechner. Thirty years ago, I made a game called Prince of Persia. Now I'm releasing my 1980s game-dev journals as a book. AMA!
Thirty years ago, I made a game called Prince of Persia. Later, I worked with Ubisoft (as game designer) and Walt Disney Pictures (as screenwriter) to relaunch the franchise with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time––the game in 2003, the movie in 2010.

Now we're celebrating the original game's 30th anniversary with a new illustrated and annotated hardcover book of my 1980s game-dev journals: The Making of Prince of Persia, just published by Stripe Press. Ask me anything!

Well, ALMOST anything. I can’t answer questions about unannounced projects, even (especially) Prince of Persia. Alas.

We are medical experts with the American Heart Association. 911 calls are down, and hospitals are still the safest place to go when you have a medical emergency. Ask us anything about resuscitation, patient care and the COVID-19 pandemic!
Hello, Reddit! We are Comilla Sasson M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, and Alexis Topjian M.D., M.S.C.E., FAHA.

About Dr. Sasson: I’m a Denver-based emergency room doctor who recently spent a month in New York City caring for patients with COVID-19 at a temporary hospital at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. While serving there, I continued my work alongside the American Heart Association as vice president for emergency cardiovascular care science and innovation. The COVID-19 crisis has presented new and unique challenges in performing emergency cardiovascular care that have required quick, science-based solutions and guidance for health care professionals and the public around the world. 

About Dr. Topjian: I am a Philadelphia-based pediatric critical care medicine physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I also serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pediatrics at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The American Heart Association encourages the public to call 911, especially if they or a loved one may be having a stroke or heart attack. A new cause for concern during the pandemic is that fewer people are calling 911. It’s important to remember that hospitals are still the safest place to be if you are having a heart attack or a stroke. Don’t hesitate or doubt: Call 911 at the first sign of a heart attack or stroke. 

We’ll be answering your questions on how COVID-19 has affected patient and resuscitation care, interim CPR guidance during COVID-19, and ways hospitals are adjusting and treating non-COVID patients safely. Dr. Sasson can also discuss her time caring for COVID-19 patients in New York City. Ask us Anything!

Hi,

My name is Christina and I am a co-owner of Greenwich St. Jewelers in NYC. I am also a Graduate Gemologist with over 15 years experience within the diamond industry. Our second generation jewelry business is known for engagement rings, diamond curation, custom design and designer fine jewelry.  

We see so many clients that are overwhelmed by all of the information available to them from informational sites to selling sites. I am here to answer questions that you may have about diamonds, buying an engagement ring or shopping online vs in-store.  

This is my first AMA! I hope people find it helpful and informative!!

We're authors of a new book on Mohammed bin Salman's rise to power in Saudi Arabia, BLOOD AND OIL. Ask us anything!
We are two Wall Street Journal reporters who have been writing about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for years, covering Mohammed bin Salman’s rise to power and his efforts to change the country's society and economy. Together we have just released a new book, BLOOD AND OIL, which contains new revelations on the inner workings of the royal family and how the struggle for succession produced the charismatic and ruthless MBS.  Details of his lavish lifestyle, secret parties, and bold power grabs are part of this larger-than-life story.  Ask us anything!

I am a structural bioinformatician—a scientist who uses mathematics and computer science to understand how the shape of proteins control the chemistry of life. AMA about being a molecular biologist from behind a keyboard.
Hello! My name is Dr. Steve Darnell and I’m a principal scientist at DNASTAR, a life science software company in the midwestern United States. I don’t work in a “wet lab” with test tubes, pipettes, or petri dishes. Instead, I help make [software to solve problems for biology and medical researchers]( https://www.dnastar.com/workflows/protein/). My work focuses on scientific topics like [predicting the shape of a protein’s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence]( https://www.dnastar.com/blog/structural-biology/why-structure-prediction-matters/), predicting how two or more proteins bind to one another, designing amino acid sequences that bind more tightly to a target, and applying all of these topics together to make better therapeutic molecules.
Do you have scientific, business, or career questions about computational biology or how it affects our lives? AMA! I’ll do my best to answer them.

We are Chris and Grant and we wrote How To Drink Wine to help people understand wine better. AMA!
I'm Chris Stang, the CEO and co-founder of the restaurant discovery platform The Infatuation (and recently acquired Zagat), and I'm with Grant Reynolds, an award-winning sommelier and owner of Parcelle Wine in NYC. Together we wrote a book called How To Drink Wine. It's not a book that's going to make you an immediate expert, but we wrote it to help you understand enough to begin to incorporate wine into your life.
 
How To Drink Wine is about the 29 wines you’re most likely to come across out in the world. From how wine is made, to whether or not it really needs to “breathe." It's meant to be relatable and entertaining and not teach you anything about a grape you've probably never heard of called Grechetto. That said, if you already do enjoy having high level discussions about obscure grapes from Italy, I have a feeling you’ll like this book too.  How To Drink Wine comes out May 12th and all the info on how to get it is here: https://www.theinfatuation.com/features/how-to-drink-wine-chris-stang. We also have a weekly newsletter for wine, if you're into that too: http://theinfatuation.com/winenewsletter
 
We're here to answer any questions you have about wine, what you're supposed to (and not supposed to) do when you drink it. No question is too dumb or too obscure - but we have the right to change our mind on that. Ask away!

I am Dr. Ellie Murray, public health expert, epidemiologist ＆ go-to source for navigating daily life during COVID-19. AMA about how to safely see friends and family, travel, go to medical appointments ＆ more during the pandemic.
I am Dr. Ellie Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health. I research the control of disease patterns in human populations. Specifically, my work is centered on improving evidence-based decision-making by patients, clinicians, and policy makers. In recent months, I have zeroed in on understanding the spread of COVID-19. I developed a spectrum of risk and harm reduction tips for every setting – from seeing friends and family, to traveling, to medical appointments and more – in an effort to help people choose low-risk activities that are sustainable in the long-term. 
 
Ask me anything about:

 - What are the risks of returning to everyday activities?
	◦	How can I evaluate the risks of different activities?
 - How can I see family and friends safely?
 - What do the COVID-19 numbers in America mean?
 - Is it safe to travel?
 - Should I go to the doctor/dentist – or reschedule?
 - Should I go to restaurants?
 - Can I safely return to the gym?
 - How long will social distancing last?
 - What does “herd immunity” mean? Is it a good solution to address the pandemic?
 - How can we improve COVID-19 testing?
 - Are there certain activities that are legally allowed during reopening that I should still avoid because they’re high-risk? 
 - What are the best types of masks for exercising, returning to school and/or work, traveling and more?
 - What are the most important precautions for preventing the spread of coronavirus?
 - Where can I find the most accurate, up-to-date information on COVID-19?
 - What should I do if I’m experiencing COVID-19 fatigue?
 
I have been quoted in news stories covering these topics in publications including Wired, Business Insider, Vox, U.S. News ＆ World Report, The Washington Post, Newsweek, Politico, The Atlantic, New Scientist, Slate, The New York Times, Medium, The Boston Globe, and more.
 
I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow in Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I have an ScD in Epidemiology and MSc in Biostatistics from Harvard, an MPH in Epidemiology from Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, and a BSc in Biology from McGill University.

I’m the author of Conscious Grief &amp; Loss Guide. As a psychotherapist I specialize in grief and trauma. Ask me anything about saying Goodbye and Managing Grief and Loss.
None of us want to experience the loss of a loved one, but the sad reality is that death is a certainly, and grief is going to come knocking many times throughout our lives. I’m Lise Leblanc, psychotherapist and author of the Conscious Grief &amp; Loss Guide. In my 20 years as a therapist, I’ve learned that even though we know for certain that 100 percent of us are going to die, we are rarely fully prepared to lose a someone we love. When it happens, we don’t know what to say, what to do, or how to cope with the overwhelming feelings of loss and loneliness. Unfortunately, grief is the price we pay for having been given the gift of loving someone so deeply, and although I can’t take your suffering away, I can answer many of your questions and give you strategies to help you cope with your loss.

My organization has received numerous awards, including the 1997 ComputerWorld Smithsonian Award (for innovative uses of technology in conservation) and the 2017 Whitley Award "Green Oscar" for our project in Panama. I have studied nature both academically and in the field.

I was born and raised in Venezuela, South America. I received a Bachelor’s of Science in Animal Science in 1973, and a Master’s degree in Range Science-Natural Resources in 1978 (Utah State University). In 1996, I received a Doctorate in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation with a dissertation on the “Biology and Conservation of the Harpy Eagle in Venezuela and Panama.”

In 1998, a colleague and I founded [EarthMatters.org](https://earthmatters.org/) specifically focused on finding, monitoring, and protecting the wild populations of Harpy Eagles throughout South America. Since, we have located Harpy nests in Venezuela, Panama, Brazil and Costa Rica.

Ask me anything about Harpy eagles, other Neotropical raptors, technology in field biology research, or nature tourism.

Oh, and I've also trapped and relocated over 300 Gopher Tortoises throughout Florida.

**EDIT:** a little after 5pm EST and time to shut down the AMA. Thank you all so very much for the time and great questions; it has been a joy talking Harpys with you!  If there are more questions, please don't hesitate to ask and I'll answer them as quickly as I can.

*A parting thought:* Please, do what you can to help environmental conservation. It's not a political issue - it's a global issue! Feel free to drop by EarthMatters for [more info on Harpys](https://earthmatters.org/) or [to support our cause.](https://earthmatters.org/donate/)Thank you.

There’s more to being a Navy pilot than what you see in the movies – I would know, I’m a TOPGUN instructor. Ask me anything!
Hello! My name is LT Kyle “Washjob” Haith and I’m a pilot and instructor at the Navy Fighter Weapons School, commonly referred to as TOPGUN. 

Like tons of other kids, I dreamt of becoming a fighter pilot when I grew up. When TOPGUN made its Hollywood debut, a stereotype about cocky pilots was born. But I’m here to set the record straight: not every flight is set to an 80s power chord soundtrack. There are shockingly few cheesy bar serenades and beach volleyball montages here. And at the real TOPGUN, ego doesn’t fly. 

The men and women I have the honor to fly with are humble, approachable, and credible. Together, we share one unifying goal: creating the world’s best Strike Fighter Tactics Instructors to train the fleet and ensure victory in combat. We don’t fly for fame, and we’re not in the business of “good enough.” Ask me anything.

Hello everyone....my name is Franky Davis and I've followed this subreddit for some time. I'm a 4th year orthopedic surgery resident. I'd love to give insight into what it takes to make it through the medical/surgical training process this day and age. Also, orthopedic surgery can be wild! From putting nails in femurs to joint replacement, the surgeries can be open, gory but also contain a lot of finesse/technical skill. I'm married with two kids so could also shed some light on family life throughout this process. This is sort of a basic topic. However, I'd love to have some discussion. Ask me anything!

I am a Heart Transplant Recipient. Ask me anything
Hello everyone. I had  a Heart Transplant on February 5th, 2007 when I was only 14 years old. I was born with a congenital heart defect, had to undergo numerous surgeries, almost died of heart failure, got my transplant and now I am living my best life 13 years later as a school teacher. My transplant story was one heck of a roller coaster. Ask me anything you want. I will answer to the best of my ability.

Edit 1: Thank you so much for all the questions. Please feel free to ask as  many as you want. There is no aspect of my transplant that I am embarrassed about.

Edit 2: Fun fact about myself. I was apart of the Guinness World Record for most transplant recipients gathered in one place. There was 540 fellow recipients all gathered in one spot at the Transplant Games of America held in Salt Lake City, Utah. This was in 2018.

Edit 3: I also failed to mention that my previous heart actually stunted my growth. Pre-transplant I was only 4 foot, 11 inches and 85 lbs. I was a shrimp. By January of 2008 I was pushing 5 foot 6 inches and weighed close to 130Lbs. I am now 5' 11" and weigh 170 lbs. My doctors predicted I would be around 6ft shortly after I was born... I was not disappointed.

We left our jobs to pick up litter and create the world's largest litter data set. We’ve stopped close to 200,000 pieces of litter from going into SF Bay. Ask us Anything!
Three years ago, Elena’s dog Larsen (the corgi) choked on a chicken bone he found while on a walk around Brooklyn. Larsen was fine but we were mad as hell - and couldn't stop talking about litter. 

We couldn’t find much relevant information about the litter in our neighborhood, so we decided to become experts ourselves. We started by tracking how much litter we picked up on each street and sharing that information with the community, hoping to raise awareness and encourage action. 

Since then, we’ve fully committed to cleaner streets. We moved to one of the dirtiest cities in the US - San Francisco - and launched an iOS app, [Rubbish](https://www.rubbish.love/), that lets us track the litter. We created a [smart litter picker-upper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ9crcWoqqc) that automatically tracks what's being picked up. Rubbish conducted San Francisco’s longest and [largest litter studies](https://medium.com/rubbish-love/130-000-reasons-why-data-science-can-help-clean-up-san-francisco-6412eba1e374), made to the top of r/pics with the 8,000 cigarettes we collected off the streets (we kept them our porch for a month before we sent it to be recycled) and used data to [cut litter by 47%](https://www.rubbish.love/2019/03/04/a-polk-street-love-story/) in some neighborhoods. 

We believe cleaning litter is the easiest way to help your local environment, make our communities healthier and keep plastic from getting into the ocean - all while getting some steps in.

I just spent my first year as a free man after being wrongfully convicted and incarcerated for 23 years. AMA
I'm Ricky Kidd. In 1997, I was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for double homicide — a crime I didn’t commit. I couldn’t afford a lawyer, and the public defender I was assigned didn’t have time or the resources to prove my innocence. I spent 23 years behind bars trying to prove the things my public defender should have found in the first place. In August of 2019, a judge ruled that I was innocent and released me. After I got out, I started "I Am Resilience," an organization that raises awareness about those who have been wrongly convicted. Last month, I got married and, in December, we're expecting a baby daughter.
 
And I’m Sean O’Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. With the help of UMKC clinical students and my co-counsel, Cindy Dodge,  I represented Ricky for more than a decade and eventually got him released last year. I’ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row. Before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.
 
Ricky’s story and how it illustrates the greater crisis in America’s public defender systems was the subject of a PBS NewsHour podcast called [“Broken Justice,”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice) released last year. In October, about a year after Ricky was released, producer Frank Carlson checked in with him [for a special episode](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice/an-update-from-ricky-kidd).

Edit: 

Ricky: I’m happy that we had this time! It is always fun to be with the PBS NewsHour team, along with the one individual who first believed in me, who ultimately never left my side until I came home. A fun and exciting year it has been and looking forward to the next chapter with I Am Resilience/new baby/marriage/purposed living. Feel free to listen to "Broken Justice" if you haven’t had a chance, and if you would like to support and participate in the next chapter forward for me, feel free to follow this link and share as much as possible: https://linktr.ee/IAR

Sean: In closing: Until we reform indigent defense systems, this story will play out over and over again. There are lots of ways to get involved, and lots of good people trying to change the system. Find out who is doing the work in your community, and support them. Sister Helen Prejean says if all you can do is bake a pie, bake a pie and bring it to a meeting! I'm happy to say Ricky's team was kept well-fed by people who care.

I'm Callum Skinner, Olympic gold medallist and the world's fastest cyclist (in the velodrome), here to talk about how my new venture, HindSight, wants to change the way the world cycles.
Hi Reddit, the KickStarter campaign for our new product, HindSight cycling glasses, has now gone live! 

So far the response has been great, and I'm here today with my business partner and co-founder Alexander Macdonald to talk about how our new company hopes to change cycling for the better, and will be answering questions about cycling, the competitive racing and the product's at HindSight from 12pm EST.

Our technology is sunglasses with fully integrated rear-view mirrors, allowing cyclists to be significantly more aware of what's happening around them, and therefore able to make smarter decisions, and allowing competitive cyclists to be more tactical in their races.

Everyone who has tried our glasses has changed the way they cycle - they check behind them more, they are proactive on the roads instead of reactive, and each and every one of them has come to us after returning the test model saying they wished they had them for everyday use.

Give our KickStarter video a watch, and please come back with any questions!

If you like our campaign, please share it with your cycling-crazy friends (everybody knows one or two), or support us if you want.

Hey Everyone, Sabrina Paseman and Megan Duong here. We're Ex-Apple employees and founders of Fix The Mask, a non-profit organization dedicated to quickly supplying better masks in the fight against COVID-19. Ask Us Anything!
Hey everyone, Sabrina Paseman and Megan Duong here. We’re the founders of Fix The Mask, a non-profit organization dedicated to quickly supplying better masks in the fight against COVID-19. 

Since the start of this pandemic, we’ve watched vulnerable communities across the globe suffer from the lack of proper protection. With a shortage of N95 masks, many lives and families have been put at risk. We couldn’t just sit back and let this happen, so we took matters into our own hands. 

With the help of engineers across the country, we’ve deconstructed the N95 mask to find out how we can reconstruct a good mask, faster. We learned that for every 1 N95 mask made, over 300 surgical masks are made. Similar to N95 masks, ATSM-level surgical masks are made of the same material stack-up, and are tested to filter out 95% of COVID-19 particles. However, they lack the tight seal that N95s have. That’s where rubber bands come in. Using only 3 rubber bands, we’ve created a tight seal for surgical masks, creating a DIY Surgical Mask brace.
 (How-to make the brace https://youtu.be/CVjGCPfRwUo)

In addition to the DIY rubber band method, we’ve also engineered and published a more sophisticated Open Source Mask Brace Design—so that anyone in the world can make it at scale. Anyone with a rubber sheet and scissors will be able to create a comfortable, easy-to-clean, reusable brace. In addition, we are partnering with different manufacturers to bring these to the world, at scale.

Our mission is to supply safe mask solutions, quickly—to everyone. That includes more vulnerable communities like developing nations. We’ve been working side by side with doctors across the globe who need help protecting those who need it most. 

We’re here to help in the fight against COVID-19. We hope that sharing these brace designs will help anyone in need, including essential workers and vulnerable communities, to take the necessary measures to protect themselves and their families.

I'm a substance abuse counselor and ‘Hope Dealer’- Ask Me Anything!
My name is Lucy I’m a person in long term Recovery and what that means it’s been 30 years since I’ve had the need to use any mind or mood altering substance. My goal is to bring the light and language of Recovery to the world and share my experience strength and Hope. I come from generational addiction.  My mother died of alcoholism when I was six. The impression she left in my life inspired me to reach out to women who suffer from addiction and women with children. I wanted to help bridge the gap from troubled lives and help women become independent and self-sufficient. Today, my dream has become a reality with Mary Hall Freedom House (MHFH), named in memory of my mother. Through a community of sisterhood, I coach women to free themselves from the past and live every day for the future. Over 10,000 women and children have achieved recovery through Mary Hall Freedom House since founded in 1996, by empowering them to end the cycle of generational addiction, poverty, and homelessness. I'm excited to share news about the new documentary, HOPE VILLAGE, which premieres TODAY, MAY 12th at 8 PM (PST). Here’s the Film trailer: 
https://youtu.be/Sluf5uBQufk
 
In the film, I share how the death of my mother Mary due to alcoholism complications launched my journey of self-discovery. I sank to the depths of self-destruction with drugs and alcohol only to rise from the ashes and use what I learned to help other women in their own recovery. The film is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083VPRSWD/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl). Also, in light of the new normal, we find ourselves in due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Sunwise Media is hosting a FREE live stream premiere party and online workshops for National Substance Abuse Prevention Week. We are inviting all treatment centers, schools, and individuals in recovery and their loved ones to join us online today, May 12th.

I was an abandoned baby left to die on the side of a street in Vietnam. I underwent several surgeries as a child, and now I will be graduating (for the second time) from a University in Canada. AMA.
I was a couple days old when I was found at the side of the road with my umbilical chord still attached. I was taken in by a farmer and stayed with his family for a few months before officially being put up for adoption in an orphanage.

My parents adopted me when I was around 20 months old (I was like a family Christmas present lol) and brought me back to Canada.

I was also born with a clubbed foot and couldn't walk by myself. This led to several surgeries as a kid to rebuild my foot but it ended up not working out in the end and I had a trans-tibial amputation when I was 16.

It's been a long road but I'm excited to be graduating from University this June. I had also completed a program a year previously.

I've done AncestryDNA and I know my estimated ethnicity but I got no hits on close family. I probably won't find out who my birth parents are.

I've been told many times that my story is quite interesting but I mainly wanted to post this AMA for people who are curious about leg amputees but are too afraid to ask in person.

EDIT: Adding proof. This is the letter the farmer left to me and translation of adoption papers

I'm Christian Selig, I used to work at Apple and now I work full-time on building the Apollo Reddit app with over 2 million downloads. Today, I'm donating 100% of the app's proceeds to my local SPCA Animal Shelter, which desperately needs the help with pets, and I want to break the record! 🐶🐱 AMA!
EDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly!

Hey!

As a short intro, my name's Christian Selig, today's my 27th birthday, and I'm a programmer. I build the [Apollo for Reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) and worked at Apple prior to that. Last year through the Reddit community [we broke the all-time, single day donation record for my SPCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cg18r3/update_on_yesterdays_apollo_spca_fundraiser_ama/). This year with the SPCA needing the help more than ever, I'm determined to beat that record and raise even more money this year!

In the summer of 2014 I was getting my Computer Science degree in eastern Canada and was lucky enough to land an internship at Apple all the way over in Cupertino, California, which was a long way from home! I learned an absolute ton there and it really changed my life and made me want to build apps as a career, after seeing how amazing it is how many people you can reach with an app you create.

So I set out to build my Reddit app Apollo after not being satisfied with any of the Reddit apps available. I wanted something super fast and lean, while also having a ton of power features and a really clean design that's fun to use. Fortunately that resonated with a lot of people, and Apollo garnered a lot of interest and had a lot of beta testers, making the eventual release really, really awesome and now it's gone on to be downloaded over 2 million times and it's been my full-time job since way back in 2015 after I graduated university. It's iOS only for now (and was [voted the best iOS Reddit app](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/)) but I'd love to build it for Android too one day if I get the chance (I'm just one guy building this and time is tight)!

### So, what's the plan for raising a bunch of money for the SPCA?

-  **Today, 100% of the proceeds from the app will go to the SPCA Animal Shelter in Nova Scotia.** I need to break that donation record. If you have even a passing interest in Apollo, today's an awesome day to unlock the Pro or Ultra version, but even if you already have, I went a step further this year and commissioned a really gorgeous custom app icon by the almost offensively talented [David Lanham](https://dlanham.com/). Not only today, but every day going forward forever, all the proceeds from that icon will be going to the Nova Scotia SPCA, so unlocking that icon would mean an absolute ton to me. [Here's a peek at the icon.](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png) It also comes with some custom wallpapers and an Apollo Community Pets Photo Album!
- You can also **donate directly to the fundraiser page I created**, which would be amazing! https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/apollo-app-2020-spca-fundraiser/ This gives you a direct way to donate if you already have the app, or just are awesome and want to donate directly. This is terrific too if you work for a cool company that does donation-matching, which would double your donation!
- For every comment this thread gets, I'll donate $0.10 (including my own answers), so if you have even a silly question, go for it! (Just don't spam haha, don't want to create trouble for the mods)

### Why right now? Everything okay with the shelter?

This warm time of the year is really rough on the shelter. These months are dubbed "[kitten season](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/)" because it's far and away the most active times for kittens to give birth. The shelters get overwhelmed with orphaned and surrendered (and sometimes left for dead) kittens from owners who are surprised to find their cat gave birth, and the shelter's resources (like food) get incredibly strained. A tidal wave of kittens sounds cute in theory, but it's seriously overwhelming.

Worse, with the COVID pandemic, kitten season is poised to be even worse this year with less people bringing in their pets to be neutered, and less adoptions occurring from people staying inside, so they're really hurting more than ever.

EDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly!

I am Erika Lust, indie adult filmmaker creating sex-positive adult cinema with sexually intelligent narratives, relatable characters and realistic hot sex. I'm here to talk to you about my latest mini-series, 'Safe Word' (or anything your heart desires). Ask me anything!
Hi Reddit, Erika Lust here. I'm here to talk to you about my latest original adult mini-series 'Safe Word', to be released this week on [LustCinema](https://lustcinema.com/?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=redditama&amp;utm_campaign=lustcinema).

The series is a full immersion in the BDSM healthy, sexy culture of communication and awareness in sex. Mainstream movies like '50 Shades of Grey' or 'Normal People' can often encourage misrepresentations of these practices by mainly framing them as a product of past traumas rather than a consenting game of mutual sexual power exchange and liberation. I wanted to give the public a credible, sex-positive representation of BDSM &amp; kink practices instead, so... ask me anything!

The first episode will be available for free for those who [sign up at this link](https://lustcinema.com/lp/free-episode-soft?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=redditama&amp;utm_campaign=safeword)!

I’m Rebecca Henderson, a Professor at the Harvard Business School and I’ve just published a book called “Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire”. We need to reimagine capitalism *now* if we’re to master this pandemic, stop global warming, keep the oceans alive and build a just society. AMA!
I’m Rebecca Henderson and I’ve been a business school prof for over thirty years – first at MIT, where I studied innovation, and now at the Harvard Business School, where I lead the required first year course in leadership and corporate accountability. I’m a huge fan of genuinely free and fair capitalism, but ten years ago I came to believe that capitalism in its current incarnation was at risk of destroying both the planet and our society. I’ve been studying this issue ever since, and I’ve come up with a number of ideas as to how business people can help to get us back on track. As the pandemic is making only too clear, we need to build an economy in which firms are genuinely purpose driven and full partners in building a healthy democracy and a health society. The good news is that this is not a pipe dream -- it’s already happening… AMA

I’m the lead scientist at DECIEM, creators of The Ordinary, NIOD, and more. Ask Me Anything!
My name is Prudvi Mohan Kaka and I am the Chief Scientific Officer at DECIEM, The Abnormal Beauty Company. I joined the company in 2014 and I work in our lab overseeing all areas of our product’s life-cycle. My background includes a degree in pharmaceutical sciences and an advanced degree in biotechnology and microbiology. I use this experience to bring a unique perspective to the beauty industry, as I view skincare as healthcare, not luxury but necessity. My day to day includes guiding multiple teams at DECIEM to think outside of the box when creating products in order to provide skincare with synergistic chemical relationships. 

For those new to us, DECIEM is a humble and happy umbrella of good beauty brands, such as The Ordinary, created in 2013. We're founded on the principle of doing everything others don't do and we are changing the world of beauty based on this principle. 

For those of us joining again after [last year's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dy5h73/hi_my_name_is_prudvi_and_i_am_the_head_scientist/), a warm welcome back. A lot has changed in a year, and I’m thrilled to connect with you all again.

Today I am here to answer all of your questions about the science of skincare, formulations, routines, and working in this field. 

I’m all yours 12:00 - 2:00 PM EST. 

AMA!

EDIT: Hello everyone! I have to run back to the lab, but this has been so much fun and I will work to respond to as many questions as I can throughout the rest of the day (if the lab allows hehe). Thank you so much for joining my AMA and for the love! Stay safe and stay sciency. ;-)

IAMA writer specializing in career services. I rewrite the Resumes/CVs, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles of my 500+ clients and advise them in their search work. I am from NY and I've lived in Spain/France. Currently, I live in Portugal. AMA about job hunting, remote work, living abroad, etc.!
Hi all, This is the link to my website to prove that I am who I say I am ➡ [**www.danielcatalan.com**](https://www.danielcatalan.com)**. And** here is [**more proof.**](https://imgur.com/a/5ZejE8r)

I love what I do as my work is social in nature. I interview all of my clients who hail from all walks of life and locations all over the world. During these meetings we have profound conversations as I write their new resumes/CVs in real-time, sharing my screen with them via Zoom so they can observe the new document as it is being built and collaborate on the process. I've refined resume/CV writing down to a science and it takes me 1.5 hours maximum to create a compelling document. The results speak for themselves as many of my clients have achieved their goals.

September marks one year of this being my full-time job instead of a side hustle, and I am grateful to have a job that I derive meaning from, which in turn helps others find work that they themselves can derive meaning from.

During the initial stages of the COVID19 lockdown, I gave free resume/Linkedin advice to workers who abruptly lost their jobs in [**this thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/fy2gbp/i_am_a_professional_resume_writer_offering_free/)**.** I ended up giving feedback to 70 Redditors, and in the months that followed, gained 20 paid clients from Reddit, and am grateful that this community has embraced my concept.

I would be happy to advise more Redditors in this AMA on how to market themselves to their next employer.

Much love.

**UPDATE 1:** Hi all! Thank you to everyone who participated in this AMA! I want to give a special thanks to the handful of haters for keeping me sharp. It is because of you that I know I've made it.

I hope that the knowledge gained here will be an asset to everyone here moving forward. To those of you who have connected with me to access my services, I will try to respond to most/all of the inquiries and booking requests over the course of the next week. This AMA has gained me an unprecedented influx of inquiries and has allowed me to access communities that I would not have been able to reach otherwise. I am quite grateful.

**UPDATE 2: (09/06/20)** This thread has been among the best things to ever happen to me. I have been meeting Redditors with captivating stories round-the-clock to rewrite their resumes/CVs. A few days ago, to mark the one-year anniversary of my launch, a member of my creative network [**filmed and produced this video**](https://vimeo.com/453637623) which concisely explains the nature of my work while showcasing the beauty of my adopted city. There's been a lot of momentum. I will write a 3rd and final update in a few weeks to detail my reflections on this immersive Reddit experience. But first, I will take a much needed rural getaway.

**UPDATE 3: (10/25/20)** I can now grant one month of free access to the premium version of the resume building tool to my clients. After the month trial expires, you can continue to make adjustments to any resumes made prior. I have decided to share this with everyone here with [**this link.**](https://www.resumonk.com/welcome?u=bb1ab443-1db9-4b3b-9274-b276ffe86481)

HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: an AMA with Cory Doctorow, activist, anti-DRM champion, EFF special consultant, and author of ATTACK SURFACE, the forthcoming third book in the Little Brother series. [xpost]
Hey there! I’m Cory Doctorow (/u/doctorow), an author, activist and journalist with a lot of privacy-related projects. Notably:

* I just published [HOW TO DESTROY SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM](https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59) with OneZero. It’s a short e-book that argues that, while big tech’s surveillance is corrosive and dangerous, the real problem with “surveillance capitalism” is that tech monopolies prevent us from passing good privacy laws.

* I’m about to publish [ATTACK SURFACE](https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/), the third book in my bestselling *Little Brother* series, a trio of rigorous technothrillers that use fast-moving, science-fiction storytelling to explain how tech can both give us power and take it away.

* The [audiobook of ATTACK SURFACE](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/attack-surface-audiobook-for-the-third-little-brother-book/) (the subject of a record-setting Kickstarter) that I ran in a bid to get around Amazon/Audible’s invasive, restrictive DRM (which is hugely invasive of our privacy as well as a system for reinforcing Amazon’s total monopolistic dominance of the audiobook market).

* I’ve worked with the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org) for nearly two decades; my major focus these days is [“competitive compatibility”](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability) – doing away with Big Tech’s legal weapons that stop new technologies from interoperating with (and thus correcting the competitive and privacy problems with) existing, dominant tech.

Just like being above average, most people consider themselves to be critical thinkers (at least compared to those dopes who disagree with them). But what does it mean to think critically? Where did the notion arise that there is a form of thinking, distinct from intelligence and wisdom, unique enough to be called "critical."

IAmA writer, absurdist, and satirist who recently started a viral misinformation campaign… by accident. You might know me as RamsesThePigeon. AMA!
Hey, folks!

I’m going to bury the lede a bit by explaining who I am first: For the past several years, I’ve been one of the most-active Redditors on the site. (You may have seen my stories and screenplays – many of which feature [a guy named Dave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/iax8ja/theres_a_good_chance_that_your_calculator_history/g1rfw3i/) – or [ill-advised attempts at comedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ioyi0e/i_used_to_amuse_myself_by_leaving_fake_hazard/).) I alternate between hunting spammers, [yelling at people](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/a9zlu8/may_have_just_found_next_yanni_or_laurel/eco0c8o/), offering quasi-humorous writing lessons, and creating my own original content.

That last activity got me into a little bit of trouble the other day.

------

I created [this satirical piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCZu8a5r5y4) shortly after COVID-19 started being recognized as a genuine threat. In the months that followed, quite a few different people ripped, cut, and shared incomplete versions of the video across a variety of social media sites. Worse still, many of those individuals insisted that they were presenting “proof” of the pandemic having been intentionally engineered.

Given that my original upload barely passed 60,000 views, I was entirely unaware of this… until fact-checkers from Belgium, France, and The Netherlands started reaching out to me. In the days that followed, I learned how far the “misinformation” had spread, and I found myself explaining not only that that the majority of my video content is absurd satire (like “[The Mick Jagger Conspiracy Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCxL6QSYo_A)"), but that the viral piece in question was intended to lampoon the anti-science perspectives which were arising at the time.

Predictably, [the news articles](https://factchecknederland.afp.com/deze-satirische-video-werd-dit-jaar-gemaakt-als-reactie-op-covid-19-misinformatie) containing the truth haven’t spread nearly as far as the doctored videos, and it was only yesterday when [Snopes confirmed that my piece was a joke](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/avoiding-future-plague-psa/).

Anyway, I’ll start answering questions about a half an hour after initially posting this, so ask me anything about writing, Reddit, production, satire in general… or anything else you want, really!

------

**Edit:** This has been a lot of fun, everyone! Thank you so much for the questions, the conversation, and the entertaining interactions. I'll be closing out this AMA for now, but chances are that you'll be able to find me around the site. As a final thought, remember to question the veracity of (and the motivations behind) what you see, hear, and read... because it *might* end up being a joke.

I'm Running for Austin School Board District 8 (City-Wide), AMA
My name is **Mike Herschenfeld and I'm one of the candidates for the citywide seat on the Austin School Board**. You can find a lot of information about the campaign at [www.mikeforaustin.com](https://www.mikeforaustin.com) and [www.instagram.com/mikeforaustin](https://www.instagram.com/mikeforaustin) but here are a few highlights:

* I'm a former high school teacher, district administrator and state education leader with experience in designing, implementing, and managing systems in schools that focus on equity, accountability, and educator support.
* I've supported systemic change management work in many districts across the country and across Texas.
* Austin ISD is one of the most economically segregated school districts in the state. Addressing this issue can create more options and opportunities for ALL students while ensuring the equitable needs of the students we often leave behind are met.
* Our campaign is focused on highlighting the needs of our education system to those who don't think "they have a horse in the race" because they don't have children in the schools. I believe that if you wait until you have kids to care about our schools, it will be too late for them. The quality of our education system affects all of society.

***What are a few of the biggest challenges facing the district right now?***

* Inequities based on race, income, and student ability: Engage in a comprehensive equity audit to address EVERY codified system/policy. Correct the foundation of AISD’s systems starting with addressing the enrollment and school-based funding systems.
* Lack of trust from the community: Create an ombudsman office to manage and investigate complaints. Collaborate with the community and educators to co-create a structured school redesign process.
* An increasing trend of families leaving AISD: Understand why students left and what we could have done to not lose them. Work to create the options within AISD that are reflective of those needs and wants.

# I'm here to answer any questions you might have about Austin ISD or myself. I'm looking forward to your questions!

We are Jacob and Ben—Textbook Experts. For years we’ve watched textbook publisher’s jerk students around through price control and unnecessary complexity. So we did something about it.
[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/jWCXQIx)

[More Proof](https://imgur.com/a/2EL8VKn)

When it comes to buying textbooks, students have two essential problems--complexity and price.

We all understand the price problem--"that book is HOW MUCH?!"  But the complexity problem is less understood, and it directly affects the price problem. You see, if students don't know all their options, or don't understand what they actually need (or **don't** need), they're going to pay too much.

After 17 years in the textbook industry, we finally got tired of watching countless students spend way too much money for their class material simply because they don’t understand they have options.  Publishers rely on creating confusion to ensure student’s buy new, high priced items from them instead of lower margin or used items on the web.

And the craziest thing of all...students have no idea they’re getting screwed because of textbook complexity.  They know books are expensive, but they say, “I just bought what was on my syllabus.  What’s so complex about that?” 

A lot actually, and while you might have what you need for class, you probably overpaid big time.

So, we decided to do something about it.  We understand that a typical student has no way to become a Textbook Expert, so we created a **free** tool that makes everyone an expert.    Our tool does two things. 

1. It puts students back in control by giving them every option for the material they need.  There are more options than they think--even for things like access codes.
2. It simplifies class material down into its component parts.  Publishers make a ton of money on high priced “packages” that contain more than one item.  We’ve found that if you break that package down into its individual items and just buy what you need, you can save dumb amounts of money. 

We call our free tool PageLess, and you can use it at [www.pageless.us](http://www.pageless.us/)

Curious about the inner workings of the 15 billion dollar textbook industry?  Ask us anything.

I am 29/f and I'm anosmic (meaning I've never been able to smell), AMA
**Some context**: I have a rare hormone disorder called Kallmann Syndrome (which affects 1 in 40,000 women and 1 in 10,000 men). Among other traits - some specific to men, and most of which I don't exhibit i.e. cleft palate and kidney loss - the main factors are delayed puberty (treated with HRT) and congenital (from birth) anosmia (untreatable and irreversible lack of smell).

While "anosmia" or "hyposmia" (reduced ability to smell) can be treated in some cases, mine will never be and is caused by underdeveloped olfactory nodes.

Feel free to AMA about anosmia or KS, or tell me something weird about smell that I may have never realised.

Hard to prove a lack of smell, that would be why my mum didn't believe me until I was eighteen, but I did make a video about this a few years ago and it got a few comments from other anosmics: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejjox-JOGSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejjox-JOGSo)

Students are (collectively) earning millions in scholarships to play varsity esports in college. I'm Alex McNeil, co-builder of the first directory/resource hub for varsity esports programs &amp; scholarships. AMA about the growth of collegiate esports, how to get recruited to play, and more!
Tl;dr: Ask me anything about collegiate [esports](https://imgur.com/a/kiiCwRh) in the US!

Hi Reddit, I'm Alex, the co-founder of [Looking for Group](https://lfgroup.gg/), the first directory of collegiate esports programs and scholarships in the US! We launched last week with over 190 programs listed on our site. Next week, we're adding over $250k in esports-specific scholarship opportunities, and we're just getting started. 

I'm here to answer your questions about the rampant growth of collegiate esports in colleges and universities across the country.

For some background, the popularity of collegiate esports has grown exponentially since COVID-19. With many traditional sports on hold and students stuck at home, athletics departments across the country have been turning to esports as a way to bridge the gap. Tons of schools are committing to full-blown varsity esports programs, including massive schools like [UC Irvine](https://esports.uci.edu/), [University of Utah](https://esports.utah.edu/), and [Miami University](https://redhawks.gg/). 

This makes sense, when you think about it. According to [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2008/09/16/teens-video-games-and-civics/), 97% of kids between the ages of 12-17 play video games. Once higher ed organizations started to take that fact seriously, it's been a mad flight to roll out programs. 

We got our start in collegiate esports after building a recreational esports program at my business partner's alma mater. That led us to start working with other schools that were trying to build programs of their own. 


We had the germ of the idea for [Looking for Group](https://lfgroup.gg/) after realizing how little accessible, public information there was about collegiate esports for students. (Basically, for a student to learn about a program, they would have to have it already in mind and crawl around on the school's website scrounging for info.) 

We knew a lot of the program directors and thought, "Hey! We could get this information together all in one place." 

Six months after that initial thought, we released Looking for Group with a large chunk of all the varsity collegiate programs listed on the site, and more joining every day. It's been a crazy/fun experience to launch this resource and try to build a piece of important infrastructure in an emerging field.

So without further ado, I'm here to answer questions. AMA about:

- Collegiate esports in general
- What kind of students collegiate esports programs look for
- How students can find scholarship $ to play video games in college. 
- The most popular title in collegiate esports (psst: it's not what you might guess).
- The factors driving the adoption of collegiate esports.
- What it's like to build collegiate esports programs 
- Or anything else!

Thanks!

I've made a lot of creative tech projects &amp; demos that have earned international attention over the past 4 or 5 years, and I have been on the traveling lecture circuit essentially nonstop since 2016 . . . at least until COVID-19 shut down all my live events and travel plans...

I dropped out of MIT and started a college. AMA about how colleges are handling the pandemic!
[Proof](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/posts/1673959346078508). TL;DR I dropped out of MIT and started a college called [Make School](http://www.makeschool.com). It's the college I wished existed - we offer an accredited, project-based bachelors in applied computer science where you don't have to pay if you're unemployed after graduating. Ordinarily we operate out of a campus in downtown San Francisco but have been operating online since early March. 



I did [an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d9c1mg/i_dropped_out_of_mit_and_started_a_new_college_in/) last fall and most of the questions focused on our no job = no pay model, how legit we actually are, and why a student would ever consider coming to Make School instead of a traditional college.

Since then, the entire calculus behind college choice has changed as colleges have moved online and vary in how prepared they are for the fall. To put it mildly, a lot of students are having sub-par experiences and a lot of colleges may close or significantly cut their offerings over the next few months. It isn't pretty. 

I've had a front-row seat into how colleges are handling the shift online. I'm hearing a lot of students wondering whether they should even go to college this fall, how much is reasonable to go into debt if they do, and how even to go about making those decisions when the future is uncertain.

Whether you've got questions about what it was like starting a college as a college dropout, how colleges are shifting online, or you want advice on your personal situation - AMA!

Spoiler alert - community college makes more sense than ever...

I am a retired physician of more than 40 years of experience. I've recently republished the 4th edition of my book, "Healthcare for All Americans". Ask me anything about my experiences as an immigrant doctor, history of healthcare and insurance in the US, and my ideas for universal healthcare!
Hi Reddit,

My name is Nelson A Paguyo, and I am a retired physician. I have worked in medicine here in the US since emigrating from the Philippines in 1963. I specialized in Pulmonology and practiced internal medicine and have twenty years in solo practice and thirteen years as a member of an HMO. Through my career, I have first-handedly witnessed the evolution of healthcare from the ART &amp; SCIENCE OF MEDICINE to the BUSINESS OF MEDICINE where, unfortunately, money and profits are more valued than patient care. I am joined today by my granddaughters who have tried to explain to me what reddit is and encouraged me to try an AMA. They will be helping me with the technology and will type my responses out for me. [Proof that it is me](https://i.ibb.co/yqx6t6K/366962.jpg).

Originally written in 2007, I have recently republished the [4th edition of my book, "Healthcare for All Americans"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DQQNVVB/) this year. It's a comprehensive universal healthcare plan that covers details on how we can implement and finance a truly universal healthcare for America. The plan is a hybrid approach of Medicare for All, combining government and the nature of the free-market to reduce and control the cost of insurance.

The COVID-19 Pandemic has significantly shed a light on the circumstances of the United States' broken healthcare system. Many Americans are more aware of the rising costs of healthcare in this country and are wondering why there isn't universal coverage like many other countries around the world. Ask me anything about my book, my experiences as an immigrant doctor, the evolution of healthcare in America, and my ideas for Universal Healthcare/Medicare for All!

IAmA two-time heart transplant survivor and cancer survivor. Ask me anything!
Hi Reddit! My name is Morgan, and I've had two heart transplants and Stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I am 27 years old.

I was born with about 9 congenital heart defects that made it impossible for my heart to work on its own, so in 1993 at the age of 6 months old, I got my first heart transplant at the Colorado Children's Hospital. Little did the doctors know that that first transplanted heart was defective as well, and eventually failed. When I was about 11 years old, in 2004, I collapsed in the hallways of my elementary school and was rushed to the hospital with heart failure. I got my second heart transplant that year, and it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. But it saved my life, and I got to go back to school and be a relatively healthy kid until the summer of 2012.

That's when I started getting night sweats, chills, and fever. Being a particularly stubborn person, I ignored the symptoms thinking it was the flu and that it would pass. Finally, when I could barely stand, I went to my family doctor who immediately sent me to the ER. Two weeks later (after being diagnosed with everything from West Nile Virus to Mono), the doctors found a series of tumors on my heart and spine. The tumors were inoperable, so I went through 9 rounds of chemo in the fall of 2012 / spring of 2013. In April of 2013 there was no more tumors to be seen, and I continued my college education that I had started in 2011.

Nowadays, I deal with a lot of the consequences of my transplants and cancer, but the health effects haven't stopped me from pursuing my dream - becoming a licensed counselor so that I can help others through traumatic and life-changing experiences like mine.

[AskHistorians X-Post] AMA with Dr. Aaron Beek, a classical historian specializing in piracy and banditry in the ancient Mediterranean. AMA about ancient Mediterranean skulduggery and associated questionable military actions!
#[Link to the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ihr2vc/i_am_dr_aaron_beek_a_classical_historian/)

&gt;  Hi [r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/)! I am Dr. Aaron Beek, a Research Fellow at [North-West University](http://www.nwu.ac.za/) in South Africa, and I’ve worked at numerous universities in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. I don’t have a page up yet at my new university, but [my old faculty page at the University of Memphis](https://www.memphis.edu/history/faculty/faculty/aaron-beek.php) is still up, or you can turn to [my page on Academia](https://memphis.academia.edu/AaronBeek)! 
&gt; 
&gt; My work focuses on unconventional and illegitimate forms of warfare and violence, including pirates, bandits, mercenaries, other forms of freebooters, and even the occasional politician. My first book (not out yet, I’m afraid) focuses on how ancient writers react to episodes of piracy, while my second book (not out for a ***while***, I’m afraid) instead examines the Romans’ recruitment of their own auxiliaries, mercenaries, and other ‘nonstandard’, non-legion troops.  I have previously written articles on piracy, slave wars, the civil wars in 1st century rome, mercenary employment, soldiers in Judea, and political polemic, just to give you an idea of my range.
&gt; 
&gt; Some initial food for thought: one of my key starting observations is that a very large percentage of men in the ancient world have precisely two skill-sets for making a living: farming and fighting. And if you take away their farms…then they start to look for ways to use their other set of skills.  
&gt; 
&gt; Most of my work is on the periods of the late Hellenistic and early Empire, but I’ll do my best to field anything between 700 and 700.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of differences in time zones, I’m posting \~3pm ET (which is at night for me), and I’ll try to answer a few early questions, then I’ll come back in (my) morning \~2am-6am ET to respond to the bulk.  Apologies in advance for the delay!

I am Alex and I run The Pipsqueakery, a 501c3 rodent and rabbit rescue that focuses on special needs small animals (and some large like our capybaras). Ask me anything!
Hi everyone!

My name is Alex and I run The Pipsqueakery. My partner, Jason (u/CrossP), might also jump in here but he has a lot of animal care to do today while I have a bunch of computer work.

The Pipsqueakery is a 501c3 rescue based in Bloomington, IN that takes in rodents and rabbits with a focus on those with special medical needs. We care for mice, hamsters, rats, squirrels (captive bred and permitted only), guinea pigs, degus, chinchillas, rabbits, gerbils, capybaras, patagonian cavies, prairie dogs, groundhogs, ducks (because why not ducks, one hedgehog and probably a few others that I'm forgetting because I'm constantly sleep deprived.

Some factoids to get you started: 

We recently took over rescues in Arkansas, New Jersey, and New Hampshire so that's been interesting. 

We're in the process of building a facility. 

We believe that animal rescue and human rights intersect such that we have to consider both in all that we do. 

I work a full time job in addition to running the rescue. Jason is a stay-at-home hamster dad. 

We spend a ton of money on vet bills, and I have to help more than one rabbit pee multiple times a day. 

Here's proof on whichever platform you prefer (you actually have to read what was written since the links seem to just want to preview the picture): 

On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/CHLPTM_spb7/?igshid=kzxd8znp5xrc

On Facebook go to facebook.com/ThePipsqueakery and this should be the top post on the page including a link back to here. 

Edit: I'm still here answering questions but do actually need to feed myself at some point so might slow down for a bit.

Edit 2: I'm going to sleep for a bit but I'll be back tomorrow to answer more questions if any are left!

Edit 3: I'm awake-ish so I'm back to keep answering the questions coming in!

Edit 4: I'm here all day folks. I'm not feeling great so I'll be lying in bed answering questions and tending to the sick animals that don't require me to stand up.

I did a AMA back in December 30, 2019 about how I was suffering from locked in syndrome. This time I want people to ask me anything about my recovery in all aspects physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Also how I am able to push forward when everyone told me it would be imposs
I was diagnosed with a terminal progressive disease called Toxic Acute Progressive Leukoencephalopathy. This put me into locked in syndrome and hospice for six months.

Here are some facts about what happened:


Memorial Day weekend 2017, I was diagnosed with Acute Toxic Progressive Leukoencephalopathy.  There is no way to prove  what caused my illness.  The only thing they know for sure is that it was from inhaling a toxin.  This disease is nicknamed chasing the Dragon syndrome, I used to smoke heroin on tinfoil, odds are it was a cutting agent.

This is my recovery journey from Locked-in syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma. It is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking.

I will be making video posts as I was getting sicker leading up to me being locked in and then my miraculous recovery.

Everyone thought I was “Brain dead” not in the clinical sense of the term could hear and see the entire time. People thought I would die hundreds of times,  no one has ever recovered from stage four of toxic acute progressive Leukoencephaothy

Here are some key facts about my journey to recovery:

. I was expected to die on New years eve 2017

. I was both completely locked in and in a pseudo-coma for approximately six months

. I survived six months of home care hospice on comfort measures only

. I was fully aware the entire time 

. I slowly showed my first￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ signs of doctors thinking I might be “in there“ By beginning to be able to blink and a minor movement in my right wrist

. In the mid July 2018 I became virtually locked in I could blink for no￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ and stick out my tongue for yes

. In the end of August￼￼ 2018 I became a￼ expert￼ at nonverbal communication with a Megabee 

. January 1, 2019 I began to verbalize vowel sounds

. Shortly there after I started getting mobility back in my arms legs etc.

. July 2019 my entire body was antigravity. I was working on standing and pre-gait activities.  I started communicating in full sentences

I really want to share my story with others going through some more situations both family and patients. If anyone is interested in talking with me please feel free to contact me anytime. Check out my YouTube channel that I created to see how far I’ve come!

I’m Bradley Hebdon, lead UX app designer at AccuWeather. My job is to distill a nearly limitless, constant stream of weather data into a simple, elegant visual the moment you request it. Join me on Thursday, October 22 at 1pm EDT to discuss my approach to UX design. AMA
It’s hard to imagine a more indispensable app than a weather app. It’s my job to deliver weather information including temperature, UV, air quality, precipitation, wind, and more than a dozen other data points, not only at the precise moment you request it, but in the right language, using the right measurements, not only for this moment, but for one hour from now, two hours from now, tomorrow, next week…the permutations seem endless. Unlike most other apps that have a singular purpose to entertain, help us organize, or socialize with friends, designing a weather app starts with saving lives by warning of threatening severe weather, and expands into helping people get the most out of their day so they can make the best choices about what to wear, when to run, the best time to take the dog for a walk, take a hike, go sailing, star gaze and much more. Weather impacts virtually every choice we make throughout our day and for planning our days ahead. My job is to design the experience you get by distilling all of the information you need, at the moment you need it, in just a glance. I’m Bradley Hebdon. AMA.

Hey everyone!

For the past 5 years, I've been working as a legal sex worker, sex educator, and intimacy expert.

Since March, the only legal way for me to perform my job has been closed. The Governor of Nevada, Steve Sisolak, hasn't included brothels anywhere in his reopening plans despite industries of similar contact legal being allowed to open with modifications.

So, I decided to sue! Looking forward to answering your questions about the suit, sex work, and any other intimate related questions you may have!

Hello Reddit! Excited for my first AMA. My name is Martin Chalifour, I am Principal Concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and teach at Caltech and the USC Thornton School of Music. 

I have also performed with the Mainly Mozart Festival Orchestra in San Diego for the past thirty years. Mainly Mozart's orchestra is a collection of the country's top orchestral players and a true symbol of musical excellence. On July 11, Mainly Mozart put on the first live classical concert in the U.S. (presented by a major arts organization) in front of a live audience since quarantine began. It was an emotional experience to be back performing in my first concert since mid-March. 

I also have infectious disease expert Dr. Philippe Prokocimer here with me (not in person!) to answer any questions you may have regarding the safety of drive-in concerts. Dr. Prokocimer went to medical school in Paris, France, and did his post-doctoral studies at Stanford University's School of Medicine in the 80s and did important work during the AIDs crisis, tuberculosis and antibiotic resistance.

The arts are so incredibly important, if you're able, please consider donating to help us Keep Live Music Alive. You can do so  at [mainlymozart.org/donate](https://www.mainlymozart.org/donate).

I’m Greg Koch, co-founder ＆ executive chairman of [Stone Brewing](https://www.stonebrewing.com/), the 9th largest craft brewer in the U.S.  A passionate entrepreneur, beer geek, newbie philosophy nerd, and ex-wanna be musician. I enjoy traveling the world (55 countries so far) and building friendships all around it by sharing great beer. Since 1996, proud to say Stone Brewing has challenged the status quo, brewed outstanding, unique beers and poked a bit of fun at industrial big beer (and now hard seltzers) along the way!
 
The new documentary “The Beer Jesus From America” ( [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Beer-Jesus-America-Greg-Koch/dp/B081G5W6ZT) ) chronicles my tumultuous journey to becoming the first American craft brewer to build, own and operate a brewery in Europe. The German tabloids dubbed me “Beer Jesus from America,” which isn’t a title I gravitate towards, but I suppose is understandable considering that I’ve preached the word of craft beer throughout the world for a couple decades now.

It never crossed my mind I'd grow up to work for CIA. First of all, I was a girl. Second, I had a terrible sense of direction. And third, I wasn't into war.

I got married and had my daughter while deployed overseas. I had a front-row seat to war, peace, and the secret relationships that tip the balance. A decade ago, I left government service to come home and be a mom. Then last year, I wrote a memoir called Life Undercover, about the whole wild ride. So now, AMA.

Hi Reddit! My journey with “stuff” started with a broken toaster. Then a broken vacuum. I didn’t want to buy new stuff, I just wanted my stuff to work. So I started Fixup, a pop up repair shop in New York. As I fixed thousands of broken items, I learned about the emotional connections that we all have to our stuff – and the ways that businesses are designing things to be thrown out and replaced. I wrote \[Fixation\]([https://bookshop.org/a/1428/9781642830453](https://bookshop.org/a/1428/9781642830453)) with what I learned to help us imagine a different way to have stuff - one that works for individuals, businesses, and the planet. I am also a theater set designer and the Director of Campus Sustainability at Barnard College.

AMA about the broken stuff in your lives, how to have a healthier relationship with your stuff, how we can build a more sustainable, equitable, and circular economy, or how stuff and theatre go together.

I am the co-founder and programme director of a master's programme about videogames. Ask me anything!
Hi Reddit,

My name's Felix. In 2017, I got the opportunity of a lifetime: After searching long and hard for a PhD position that allowed me to write a dissertation on videogames, I not only found an amazing supervisor but also became part of a team that founded a master's programme revolving entirely around the analysis, creation, and technical understanding of the medium in Klagenfurt, Austria.

Ever since then, I have been involved in a large number of videogame-related activities at the university, including the organisation of lesson plans and conferences, the supervision of student projects and indie studio foundations and publications to hosting videogame art exhibitions.

It's been a pretty wild ride that I want to share with you, so ask me anything!

The AMA is going to open at 3AM EST (9AM CET) to 10AM EST (4PM CET). There is going to be a break of roughly two hours around 5AM EST (11AM CET) during which two of my students and I are hosting a mini crash course on videogame analysis for an online convention via Twitch (to which you are all kindly invited, I'll post a link as soon as possible :-)).

I am Keith St. Jean, or Canadian Permaculture Legacy on YouTube. IAmA engineer who found a passion planting trees and now plant over 10,000 per year. I am turning my useless grass into a thriving forest for nature, and converting my land into a multi acre wildlife sanctuary. AMA
Hi Reddit, by day I am a professional engineer, but by night (also by day) I plant trees.

I started planting trees about 5 years ago, and got, well, kind of addicted to it. I now plant roughly 10 thousand trees per year, likely much more, and am now fully converting what used to be useless grass lawn into a multi acre food forest wildlife sanctuary ecosystem. 

This year I have added a 25 thousand gallon pollinator pond. What started as a small garden has now turned into a lifestyle, where every year I add to the system - often now using plant material harvested from the system itself. 

I also use the plant cuttings and seeds to restore wildlife habitat in damaged lands such as abandoned gas stations, warehouses, and other damaged land as a hobby. 

I am doing this AMA to help spread the word about what dire need we are all in, and to help educate as many people as possible about how we can drive the most amount of change possible - by planting trees. 

About a year ago I decided that the best way to impact the world and help reverse climate change is to try to inspire others to change their lives with the purpose I have found in the last half decade. I now teach people how trees work, about soil science and the food web of life, and how to plant in order to maximize the efficiency of the system as a whole. This can be anywhere from water catchment earthworks such as swales, carbon sequestrations techniques like coppice systems and biochar production, soil water retention, what mulches do, smart design like drip edge guilds, plant synnergies through companion planting and 7 layer food forest design that mimics nature, and more.

Ask me anything related to how to plant a tree, to what is permaculture, to how we can use trees to sequester carbon and reverse climate change, to decentralizing the food chain, to the critical role of insects in our ecosystems, to well... anything.

I retired from the FBI in 2003 following a 30 year career as an investigator, instructor, and negotiator. A significant focus of my career was directed toward investigating Middle East hijackings in which American citizens were victimized. In addition, I was an FBI hostage negotiator for 23 years of my career, retiring as the Chief of the FBI’s Crisis Negotiation Unit, Critical Incident Response Group, the first person to hold that position. In that capacity I was heavily involved in numerous crisis incidents covering prison riots, right-wing militia standoffs, religious zealot sieges, terrorist embassy takeovers, airplane hijackings, and over 120 overseas kidnapping cases involving American citizens. In my book, Stalling for Time, I take readers on a harrowing tour through many of the most famous hostage crises in the history of the modern FBI, including the siege at Waco, the Montana Freemen standoff, and the D.C. sniper attacks. Having helped develop the FBI’s nonviolent communication techniques for achieving peaceful outcomes in tense situations, I offer a candid, fascinating look back at my years as an innovator in the ranks of the Bureau and a pioneer on the front lines.

Hello my dudes, Janet Devlin here! ASK ME ANYTHING YOU WANT!!
Hello hello! Janet Devlin here! I'm an independent singer-songwriter and content creator! Feel free to ask me ANYTHING!

I'm in the final stages of promo counting down to releasing my new album, Confessional, and accompanying book 'My Confessional'. The music has been five years in the making, and I'm so excited for people to finally hear it! I recently divulged my struggles with alcohol addiction in a video on my YouTube channel, so that plus other challenges I've had to overcome are covered in the album. The book 'unlocks' the meaning behind all the songs so I hope it will help some people!

Hello! I'm Sam Reich, the CEO of CollegeHumor / DROPOUT and host of Game Changer. I've been here the whole time. AMA!
Hiya Reddit! I'm Sam Reich (born and raised in Cambridge, MA), longtime employee of CollegeHumor, and as of less than a year ago, owner and CEO of it too. See, right before the pandemic hit, CollegeHumor was dumped by our corporate overlords at IAC, who laid off pretty much everyone but agreed to sell me the assets. At that point, I'd been running its video department for almost 15 years, so figured why not pour everything I had into this company as a last-ditch effort to save it?


Over the past 6 months, me and an incredibly lean team have managed to keep CollegeHumor and DROPOUT running despite losing 95% of our employees (hire them, btw, they are the best - https://hireacollegehumorer.com/), COVID-19, a fascist president, California wildfires, and a bout of diverticulitis. But as my hero Samuel Beckett would say, there's nothing funnier than unhappiness!


The long and short of it is this: we're still making YouTube sketches (I've written a couple of animated "If Google Was a Guy" episodes focused on quarantine) and still shows for Dropout (a new season fo our D&amp;D acutalplay show Dimension 20 begins tomorrow; Um Actually and Erotic Clubhouse are consistently releasing new episodes; and we have a couple of other surprises in the works). A new season of my show Game Changer - a game show in which the game changes every episode - premieres this Friday on http://dropout.tv. For safety reasons, we're shooting all of our shows remotely, but I'm genuinely so excited about this season. It includes some of favorite episodes ever, and without giving too much away, some very special guests.


And now I'm here to answer your questions, share some stories, and commiserate with you good people as our world hurdles towards an uncertain future. AMA!

I am an undercover investigator for a farmed animal protection group. Ask me anything!
I am an undercover investigator for U.S.-based farmed animal non-profit [Animal Outlook](https://animaloutlook.org/). We’ve conducted investigations into meat, dairy and egg facilities. Most recently, we conducted the first-ever undercover expose of salmon farming in the U.S. at [Cooke Aquaculture](https://animaloutlook.org/investigations/aquaculture/), where fish were stomped on and thrown, in addition to many other cruel standard practices. We also documented horrific abuse at a dairy factory farm that supplied [Nestle](https://animaloutlook.org/investigations/nestles-nightmare/). 

As undercover investigators, we often live in rural areas without much contact with anyone outside of work, if any at all, for months at a time. I've investigated three factory farms, so I’m pretty familiar with isolation, and I’d like to give some advice to anyone adhering to the current stay at home order. We’re all in this together! If you’re struggling with isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic or curious about my life undercover, ask me anything!

I am actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. You may remember me as Jaime Lannister on GoT... I've just launched a platform for grassroots giving called Dandi. AMA!
Hi. ﻿ I’m excited to share Dandi with you. [www.dandi.io](https://dandi.io/)

Confronted by the enormous challenges we face both locally and globally, it’s easy to feel powerless and overwhelmed. 

For the past 4 years, I have been lucky to work for the UNDP as a goodwill ambassador and have seen not only the real challenges we face but also been blessed to meet dedicated people from all over the world desperately wanting to make the world a better place. 

Unfortunately, charities have to spend way too much time fundraising, branding and networking– and less time doing the important work. I have had countless discussions trying to find a way to better this system. 

By using technology there is a way. We need to insist on working together across nonprofits to make sure we achieve the goals we all share, as quickly and efficiently as possible. That resources go to the groups that can solve whatever a specific challenge calls for, as soon as the need is there. Dandi is a tool that can enable us to do just that. 

Using and combining huge amounts of data from nonprofits on the ground, we will be able to direct funds to where they will have the most positive impact– faster and more efficiently than ever before.

 I urge you to check out Dandi and join this new movement of collaborative humanitarian action. 

Thank you, 

Nikolaj

Hi Reddit, I’m Willem van Schaik, I am [Director of the Institute of Microbiology and Infection](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/microbiology-infection/van-schaik-willem.aspx) at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. My research focuses on how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics: not only is this a major threat to public health across the world, but I also find the biology of microbial drug resistance endlessly fascinating. I am particularly interested to understand how antibiotic resistance develops and spreads in complex microbial ecosystems, for example in the bacteria that populate our body (‘the human microbiome’).  I am also fascinated by pandemics (past and ongoing).

I am happy to discuss anything related to microbes, e.g. how they evolve to become drug-resistant ‘superbugs’ and how microbes contribute to human health and disease. AMA!

I am working to get Campobello Island connected to the rest of Canada. Campobello is the only place in Canada where accessing the rest of the country means crossing through the USA. Ask me Anything!
Proof (Updated and Reposted):  [https://www.facebook.com/AccessibleCampobello/photos/a.158977582369341/161415662125533/?type=1&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/AccessibleCampobello/photos/a.158977582369341/161415662125533/?type=1&amp;theater) 

Campobello Island is a community of 800 year-round residents located in the Bay of Fundy off the southern coast of New Brunswick. It is indirectly connected to Canada using an international bridge to the United States of America. Campobello’s place in history is largely tied to US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who referred to Campobello as his “beloved island” and spent summers there as a child.

There is no Provincially-owned or subsidized ferry vessel serving Campobello Island. East Coast Ferries Ltd. operates a seasonal vessel tied to the summer tourism season, but the reliability of the service has been the subject of scrutiny in recent years as the 2018 ferry season was abandoned completely due to vessel issues.

Residents of Campobello Island face numerous unique challenges unlike challenges faced by any other Canadian. Islanders are the only Canadians forced to cross international borders to fuel up their cars, to obtain banking, reach governmental services, attend specialist appointments, and any number of practical services not available on the island. Domestic Canada Post mail is routinely inspected and scrutinized at the border on route to Campobello by US CBP, arbitrarily opened and sometimes seized if contents are questionable in the eyes of the agent.

Campobello has difficulty obtaining Goods and Services, threatening existing Island establishments and the food security of the Island itself. Service technicians from many fields elect not to serve Campobello, citing difficulties in accessing the Island reliably. 86% of Island Residents feel a year-round ferry is “needed” or “very needed.” Campobello Island continues to be disproportionately hindered by policies at the border both during normal operations and COVID-19 operations in a State of Emergency.

Since the 9/11 attacks and the corresponding increases in border restrictions, Campobello has watched its population decline by 35%, and a once healthy economy now lags behind the provincial average by over $6,000 per person. Deer Island to the north and Grand Manan to the south share similar economies based on fishing and tourism, and have been treading water in both demographics and have enjoyed year-round ferry connections to the mainland.

The only unique variable impacting Campobello Island compared to the other Fundy Isles is a total reliance on the International Border. The fact that Campobello has a complete reliance on the goodwill of a U.S. border patrol officer for access to Canada hurts the Island, with each additional measure prompting more families to leave the Island.

In a June 17th New Brunswick Legislature address announcing the return of a Gagetown Ferry, MLA Bruce Northrup proudly insisted that “Having reliable access to transportation infrastructure is critical for any community's long term viability and success”. Accessible Campobello and the residents of Campobello Island couldn’t agree more. Without reliable transportation infrastructure, Campobello has indeed suffered greatly, and currently has no elected voice in the Legislature.

The Accessible Campobello movement is dedicated to reversing two decades of decline. Beginning in 2017 as the Campobello Year Round Ferry Committee and reorganized as Accessible Campobello in the face of COVID-19 restrictions at the border, we continue to work at holding government accountable to protecting the constitutional rights of Canadian citizens on Campobello Island. Previous studies estimated direct Canadian economic benefit to be $2.5M/year, taking into account only the economic activity currently lost to the United States by residents’ necessity of travelling through the border. Actual economic benefit, including months added to the summer tourist season and increased access to mainland buyers for island fisheries, would likely be much higher though detailed studies have not been completed.

Working together with MLA David Coon and MP John Williamson, Accessible Campobello is dedicated to creating a year-round ferry connection to Campobello Island, opening pathways to building affordable housing, a robust, sustainable economy, improved connectivity and extended tourism opportunities are all unlocked when reliable transportation infrastructure is extended to all Islanders and mainlanders alike.

2020 marks a pivotal moment in the rich history of Campobello Island, with representatives from municipal, provincial and federal governments all recognizing the dire need for improved transportation on Campobello Island. What is yet to be written is whether this is the turning point where governments work together to make Campobello Island sustainable, viable, and ready for a return to success, or whether Campobello Island is abandoned by the governments tasked with preserving access and mobility rights for all Canadian citizens.

For the past five years I've been running the largest sound meditation events in the country. COVID forced us online, and we've found a new way to share with community. AMA
[\*Here's a photo of 1300 people meditating in SF for 'The Sound Healing Symphony\*](https://www.facebook.com/soundmeditationpresents/photos/a.218558908210654/2894240133975838/?type=3&amp;theater)

Sound meditation ( also known as a 'sound bath' or 'sound healing') is a soothing and delightful concert of ethereal instruments designed to put you in a deep state of meditation. We play gongs, crystal singing bows, vibraphones , etc to put you in a trance-like state. Many people report feeling the calmest they've ever felt.

I've been a really heady, anxious person my whole life, and this stuff opened up my world. I met my co-founder, Guy Douglas, in 2012, and he introduced me to these instruments. We've been on a journey to share how much this can help people deepen their meditation practice ever since.

&gt;\*\*Since 2017, we've regularly gathered 1300 people to meditate together on Monday nights in San Francisco!\*\*We co-created "The Sound Healing Symphony" and gathered a community of incredible musicians to share the sound in traditionally 'sacred' spaces like cathedrals, temples etc.We've sold out shows all over the country and been on NBC Today. Our shows are best known for the quality of the sound.

Proof: [here's me now.](https://imgur.com/gallery/BJvpGLn) And [here's me on NBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zg4vHbhtTM).

During the pandemic, we transitioned, quickly. We needed to find a way to keep sharing this practice, especially during a time when our community was experiencing uncertainty and isolation. **We invested all we had left in high quality audio production + livestreaming gear, and** [**we built a platform**](https://www.soundmeditationpresents.com/)**.** It was a wild ride with a lot of trial and error, but we got the sound dialed in. It sounds like we're doing a private sound bath in your home, and you can experience it at any time. Plus the livestreams enable us to still gather in a way. Our community is now subscribed at $16 a month and experiencing the sound baths in bed instead of having to go to an event ;)

In 2014, soon after recovering from a benign esophageal tumor, I found the parenting blog [That’s Inappropriate](https://www.facebook.com/thatsinappropriateblog/) to chronicle my chaotic days as a working mom, child wrangler, and busy wife.

Some of my videos have gone viral, like this one—[Go Ask Your Mother](https://www.facebook.com/thatsinappropriateblog/videos/2835762063131306/), and many of my recent ones speak to the realities of pandemic parenting.

We're an international team of cannabis researchers from 16 countries studying patterns and practices of small-scale cannabis cultivation. Ask Us Anything about cannabis!
Hi Reddit!
[We're a team](https://worldwideweed.nl/about/) of cannabis researchers from 16 different countries and we've formed the Global Cannabis Cultivation Research Consortium to better understand the patterns and practices of small-scale cannabis growers. The first round of our survey, the International Cannabis Cultivation Questionnaire v1, was conducted in 2012 and helped break apart a lot of the stereotypes about cannabis growers. Now we've launched the second round of the [survey](www.worldwideweed.nl), the ICCQ 2, and we're keen gather as many responses as possible from around the world to ensure that cannabis growers are understood as real people, not caricatures.

We're here today to answer your questions about cannabis and cannabis growing, and drug policy. While cannabis growing is the focus of this project, our team has expertise across many areas of drugs policy as well, so feel free to really Ask Us Anything about drugs and we'll do our best to get the right person on your post. Unfortunately we're social scientists, not botanists or chemists, so we're more likely to talk about deterrence theory and policy making than give you advice on the best nutrient recipe for a 4x4 tent grow using coco coir and CMH bulbs.  That said, we'd like to hear yours...

The GCCRC has team members from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Israel, Italy, New Zealand (so close guys!), Portugal, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay. Don't worry, even if your country isn't represented you can still [take the survey!](https://worldwideweed.nl/)

We would really appreciate your participation in our survey. We take your [privacy very seriously](https://worldwideweed.nl/security-and-anonymity/) and don't use any cookies or IP tracking. We also don't take money from cannabis producers or retailers, and our data is not intended for commercial use. We're a bunch of academics who care about good cannabis policy and are interested in exploring an area of drugs policy often overlooked by prohibitionist regimes that are focused on measuring arrests and not on why a person who grows cannabis does so. Our survey covers a lot of ground, including views on regulations about growing cannabis, how you grow your cannabis, and what you do with it once you've processed it.

We're launching this AMA at 9am US Eastern time (New York) and will have members of the team swinging through to answer questions throughout the day. We'll try to remember to sign our names and country with each response.

Thanks for the opportunity to talk with you today!

Edit 20:30 US ET: Thanks all. It's been a great 12 hours and we really appreciate all your questions. Please take some time to share you insights with us by taking the survey at www.worldwideweed.nl. You can also contact us via that website if you have any questions. Cheers All!

We're Sebastian &amp; Karl - two Space Architects. We're here to talk about our unfolding Moon Habitat that we will test for 3 months in isolation in the Arctic this fall - Ask us anything!
 Hi, Reddit!

We’re two Danish architects who’ve designed a Moon Habitat that can unfold like origami and expand its inner volume by 560%! It’s not ready for the Moon yet, but we’ll test it over 3 months in Arctic Greenland.  We will live like astronauts in total isolation, testing the Habitat, our bodies, and our minds. Essentially, we’re testing ways to make extreme isolation + hostile environments livable for humans, not just military-trained astronauts.

The project is completely independent of any big organizations and we are building the Habitat ourselves here in Copenhagen.

[AskHistorians X-Post] AMA with Dr. Michael Somerville, author of 'Bull Run to Boer War', and here to discuss how the American Civil War changed the British Army in the 19th century. AMA!
#[Link to AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hgp365/i_am_dr_michael_somerville_author_of_bull_run_to/)

&gt; My name is Dr Michael Somerville and I am a military historian based in London, England. I have long been interested in the American Civil War, and am President of the American Civil War Round Table UK.
&gt; 
&gt; The American Civil War is often said to have predicted the way in which later wars such as the Boer War and the First World War would be fought. As a result, the British Army has been criticised for not heeding its lessons. My recently published book *Bull Run to Boer War: How the American Civil War Changed the British Army* challenges that long-held view, suggesting that it really derives from British criticism of the Army’s performance in the First World War. I believe that the responses to the lessons of the war in the British Army were more complex, better informed, and of higher quality, than normally depicted. Key to this new interpretation is that it takes a 19th century perspective rather than pre-supposing what the British should have seen based upon hindsight from the South African veldt or the Western Front trenches. There were substantial changes in technology, tactics, and strategy during the Victorian period, all influenced to some extent by study of the American Civil War.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m available today (27 June 2020) from 13.00 to 18.00 UTC to answer any questions you may have about how the American Civil War influenced military thought in Britain prior to the Boer War.

[AskHistorians X-Post] AMA with Kidada Williams on the Histories and Legacies of Racist Violence in the U.S.
#[LINK TO AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp79kg/histories_and_legacies_of_racist_violence_in_the/)

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm Kidada Williams, a historian who specializes in how African Americans experienced and responded to racist violence and racial terror in the U.S. I am the author of They Left Great Marks on Me ,"Regarding the Aftermaths of Lynching," and a forthcoming book called I Saw Death Coming. I was one of the co-creators of #CharlestonSyllabus, the crowd-sourced resource developed to help Americans understand the context behind the 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME. We produced Charleston Syllabus, a book of readings on race, racism, and racial violence.
&gt; 
&gt; You may have seen me on Henry Louis Gates's PBS documentary, Reconstruction: America after the Civil War or heard me on Slate Academy: Reconstruction, BackStory, specifically Respectfully Yours, Gainer Atkins and The Difference Ten Miles Makes.
&gt; 
&gt; Most U.S. historians researching racist violence and racial terror have focused on perpetrators, bystanders, the state, and media responses to it. Having learned about lynching as an undergrad through the killing of Mary Turner, a heavily pregnant Black woman who was lynched as part of a 1918 lynching spree in Lowndes County, Georgia, I wondered, "how did her people live with and through her killing, that of her fetus, and her husband?" At the time, lynching historians' rarely attempted to answer that kind of question. Literary and popular culture scholars who explored African Americans' responses often prioritized public thinkers and writers, most of whom knew about this violence, which is reflected in their literature, but weren't often at the epicenter of it.
&gt; 
&gt; The inability of existing research to answer my questions drove my own research in graduate school and became the basis for Great Marks. I used African Americans' testimonies about a wide range of racist violence (night riding, lynching, Klan raids, massacres, and rape) from emancipation to the World War I to shift our gaze to targeted people. Doing that enabled me to unearth both a wider range of harm and different modes of resistance. I am especially interested in the immediate and long-term physical, psychic, and psychological injuries from this violence.
&gt; 
&gt; Although I focus primarily on African American victims, I do recognize the need to acknowledge and histories of racist violence directed at Native Americans as well as Americans of Mexican and Chinese descent and origin in the late nineteenth and early 20th century.

IAMA a student at the University of Alabama, we have received national coverage about our reopening and I've been on campus for two weeks now. AMA
Hello Reddit,

I'm a student at the University of Alabama we have received national coverage on our reopening. I've been here for about 2 weeks now and have watched the sororities and fraternities both rush. I've seen once stringent rules in the dining hall no longer enforced as more people come on campus. Some precautions are being taken, while some have just been forgotten about. Just last night we received an email that we must take more precautions and a new set of rules we must follow

In order to protect my identity and avoid backlash from the school, I've asked to remain anonymous.

AMA about life at UA under COVID or college in general! I'll start answering questions at around 6 PM CST.

IAmA 25(M) with grade 4-5 phimosis and was circumcised yesterday.
In preparation of my procedure, I read a ton of personal anecdotes from various sites that gave me a better idea of what to expect. Have not seen a AMA that was relatively recent, so made an account to post in case there were people that may benefit from it.

I went 24 years without realizing that it was an actual problem before actually seeing a doctor about it. Always thought uncircumcised/uncut looked like mine... If you’re worried about your uncut penis because you can’t expose/see the head of it, you’re at the right place. 

I’m just a lurker on reddit and never post so would also appreciate feedback as to how I can post/respond better!

Brief description of my phimosis:
- the tip of the skin was too tight so my penis was covered in a big slab of skin with a small hole at the end.
- trying to expose the tip more than a tiny bit just felt like skin was going to tear open.
- imagine that you’re putting on a turtleneck but your head is too big to go through the hole. But the turtleneck is your own skin and to go through it would mean excruciating pain and a risk of not being able to return.
- it was first noticed when I was 5-6 years old but doctors said to keep a close eye because it can naturally go away by the time a boy is 13 or 18. I immigrated to the U.S. shortly after; it was too crazy trying to survive that mum forgot and didn’t have health insurance for the majority of my life so doctors was never an option—hence this weird peepee situation taking a backseat in my life until 24 when I first saw a urologist.

I’m Obi Greenman, President &amp; CEO of Cerus. AMA about blood safety!
I'm Obi Greenman, President, and CEO of Cerus, a company founded with a simple and important mission to make pathogen reduction technology the standard of care for transfused blood components globally and enable our customers to do everything in their power to deliver safe and effective blood products to patients. Cerus was founded almost three decades ago and is the only company that has an FDA approved system to inactivate pathogens in both platelets and plasma, called the INTERCEPT Blood System. Pathogen reduction is recognized as an effective measure to reduce transfusion-transmitted infectious (TTI) risk from pathogens including HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and many other pathogens.  We partner with national blood services, blood centers, and hospitals to implement our technology into blood component production operations, which ultimately benefits patients who rely on safe blood.  INTERCEPT treated blood components are used in transfusions for cancer patients, surgeries, and medical emergencies, as well as for experimental convalescent plasma transfusions to treat COVID-19 patients.  Our INTERCEPT technology is already used in more than 30 countries across the globe.  To get a sense of our potential reach, in the U.S. alone, up to 70% of the population will receive a blood transfusion at some time in their lives.

After I got my B.A.S. in Economics and Biological Sciences from Stanford University, I began my career in healthcare and biotech at Baxter International working in its Biotech group that focused on plasma derivative therapeutics.  During my time at Baxter, I witnessed the impact of HIV and Hepatitis B and C on the blood supply and joined Cerus in 1995 believing that pathogen inactivation would become the standard of care for global blood supplies.  Improving blood safety and availability and helping blood centers do everything in their power to protect patients has become my life’s work over the past 30 years.

Historically, blood safety has been addressed with reactive strategies such as testing donated blood and deferring blood donors that might pose a greater risk to the blood supply.  With pathogen inactivation, blood centers are now able to employ a proactive approach to protect the blood supply not only against known pathogens, but also emerging infectious disease threats like Zika virus, babesia, and, of course, SARS-COV2.  Cerus’ INTERCEPT Blood System also enables a rationalization of current blood safety measures that helps reduce costs for blood centers both today and in the future.
Over the past 30 years, I have experienced multiple transfusion-transmitted disease threats to the blood industry. I'm here to answer any of your questions about how the transfusion medicine field may evolve in the next decade with the backdrop of the current pandemic, and what the future of blood safety and therapies might look like.

Artificial intelligence is taking over our lives. We’re the MIT Technology Review team who created a podcast about it, “In Machines We Trust.” Ask us anything!
Some of the most important decisions in our lives are being made by artificial intelligence, determining things like who gets into college, lands a job, receives medical care, or goes to jail—often without us having any clue.
 
In the podcast, [“In Machines We Trust,”](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-machines-we-trust/id1523584878) host Jennifer Strong and the team at MIT Technology Review explore the powerful ways that AI is shaping modern life. In this Reddit AMA, Strong, artificial-intelligence writers Karen Hao and Will Douglas Heaven, and data and audio reporter Tate-Ryan Mosley can answer your questions about all the amazing and creepy ways the world is getting automated around us. We’d love to discuss everything from [facial recognition](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/when-an-algorithm-gets-it-wrong/id1523584878?i=1000487884962) and [other surveillance tech](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/who-owns-your-face/id1523584878?i=1000487884961) to [autonomous vehicles](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ai-in-the-drivers-seat/id1523584878?i=1000490562210), how AI could [help with covid-19](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/down-and-dirty-with-covid-genes/id1523584878?i=1000489186944) and the [latest breakthroughs in machine learning](https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/)—plus the looming ethical issues surrounding all of this. Ask them anything! 
 
If this is your first time hearing about “In Machines We Trust,” you can listen to the show [here](https://megaphone.link/MIT1938197360). In season one, we meet a man who was [wrongfully arrested](https://megaphone.link/MIT3243296280) after an algorithm led police to his door and speak with the [most controversial CEO in tech](https://megaphone.link/MIT8435678217), part of our deep dive into the rise of facial recognition. Throughout the show, we hear from cops, doctors, scholars, and people from all walks of life who are reckoning with the power of AI.
 
Giving machines the ability to learn has unlocked a world filled with dazzling possibilities and dangers we’re only just beginning to understand. This world isn’t our future—it’s here. We’re already trusting AI and the people who wield it to do the right thing, whether we know it or not.
It’s time to understand what’s going on, and what happens next. That starts with asking the right questions.

We are a group of psychologists who just launched a free mental health course to support people through covid19. Ask Us Anything about staying sane in a pandemic!
Hello!

We are the [www.helpers.tools](http://www.helpers.tools/) team here to answer your questions about looking after your mental health during this huge change we are all experiencing together. We are qualified and practicing psychologists.

Something that mixes your whole life up suddenly can turn up the heat on all the problems we are used to juggling as part of a busy life. Even if you have never considered yourself someone who has ‘mental health problems’ you might have some questions about how to handle whatever you are finding tricky right now.

[www.helpers.tools](http://www.helpers.tools/) is a free 6 week course of support delivered over email that we built as a volunteer effort. It is not a business or commercial project. Combining short and simple behavioural nudges with longer weekly sessions designed to be used by two or more people in conversation, the helpers tools are designed to be a blueprint enabling a community to provide crucial psychological support for itself - without needing to wait.

Here’s the proof: [https://www.helpers.tools/ama\_proof](https://www.helpers.tools/ama_proof)

PS: While we’re doing this to provide support it is not intended to replace individual treatment with your local mental health services.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** **We're out of time!**

Thank you to everyone who asked questions tonight. We know we haven’t been able to get around to everyone’s queries, but we’d encourage people to look around the thread as there are several common themes and we might have answered a question similar to yours.

We’d like to send our best wishes to everyone out there doing their best in these difficult, uncertain times and we urge you to remember that you don’t have to be alone with any difficult thoughts and feelings.

Please speak to your local mental health professionals if your wellbeing is significantly affected, particularly if you’re contemplating self-harm or suicide. There are links to urgent support at [www.helpers.tools/urgent-support](http://www.helpers.tools/urgent-support).

Parrot AMA from the director of World Parrot Trust
Hi Reddit - I'm Jamie Gilardi, I've been director of the [World Parrot Trust](https://www.parrots.org) for about 20 years.  We help people provide happy and healthy homes for their parrots and also work around the world to save wild parrots from extinction.  

I'm a biologist and have studied many aspects of wild parrots, especially their diets and behavior.

Currently, I care for two African Grey parrots that are about 25 and 35 years old, and have cared for many other species like Budgerigars, Cockatiels, and Lorikeets for years.

IAmA Supports Black Lives Matter
The IAmA Team stands strongly against the brutality inflicted on the Black people of America. As protests grow across the country, and police respond with escalating violence, we want to give a voice to those who don't have a platform. Over the coming days and weeks, we want to amplify Black voices who need and deserve to be heard. If you are one of these many, many, many voices, we invite you to do an Ask Me Anything on our subreddit to share it, answer questions from the community, and provide insight to those wanting to listen and learn.

We want to make something very clear: this is not temporary support. We will continue to support the Black Lives Matter movement with AMAs from prominent Black leaders until Reddit folds and we cannot host AMAs on the site anymore. The brutality and systemic racism that Black people face in the United States are the result of a fundamentally broken system — one that supports white people at the expense of those who are not; one that permits those in power to murder Black people and go unpunished; one that does not value the lives of Black people the same way it does the lives of white people.The opposite of racism is not complacency or saying that "I don't see color;" it is anti-racism.

The IAmA Team stands in solidarity with the Black community — against police violence, against systemic oppression, and against racism. To that end, we want to share a number of resources  to help those who read our AMAs learn how to be better allies and to be anti-racist. You can find those resources here:

* [Anti Racism Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRlF2_zhNe86SGgHa6-VlBO-QgirITwCTugSfKie5Fs/preview?pru=AAABcpd-lAA*7ECbBhJwTAvBbYzbAP10nA)

My name is Andrew Zorowitz and I’ve been to over 250 anime, gaming, furry and comic conventions in the last 11 years selling dice and games. AMA about conventions, games, what events will look like in the future thanks to COVID, and, well, anything!
Hi Reddit! I’m Andrew Zorowitz, owner of Foam Brain Games, a dice manufacturer and convention vendor. My company went to 90 conventions in the last 12 months and I hope we’ll be returning to doing so after conventions resume. We’ve sold board games at a variety of conventions: PAX, Anime NYC, New York ComicCon, AnthroCon, Otakon,  Origins, Gen Con, local roller derby events, and many more. In the past 11 years, I’ve gone to over 250 conventions and my company has gone to over 600. I’ve served as staff on a variety of shows running their tabletop gaming programs and other various logistics jobs. We run a pin trading program, Pin Bazaar, at several large gaming and anime conventions and also do a variety of overseas manufacturing for ourselves and other customers.

We’ve also done 13 Kickstarter projects for dice and other gaming accessories, including most recently one for metal pride flag dice. You can see some of the things we’ve made in the past and make now at [www.foambrain.com](http://www.foambrain.com/)

I’ve seen lots of unbelievable things both good and bad throughout my journeys, but nothing is as unbelievable as how quickly the world is currently changing and the wide reaching effects it will have on the future of large events.

I did a Reddit AMA about 5 years ago and had a ton of fun, so I figured I would come back and answer more questions about conventions, games (and what to play in quarantine!), and the future of events.

AMA, Reddit!

Iama guy who has been living alone in an abandoned ‘ghost town’ for over 6 months. I bought the town just over two years ago. AMA!
Hey reddit,

My name is Brent and in July 2018 I purchased the former mining town of Cerro Gordo with my biz partner Jon and some friends. Cerro Gordo was once California’s largest producer of silver and once had nearly 5,000 residents and 500 buildings. Today, there are 22 buildings left, and I’m working to restore the town for more to be able to enjoy it. It’s an important piece of history.

They pulled nearly $500,000,000 worth of minerals out of Cerro Gordo and in it’s heyday, the town averaged a murder per week. That’s led to many paranormal experiences, rumors about hidden treasures, and many more legends around the town.
I came up here in mid-March to act as caretaker. I imagined coming up for a few weeks. It’s been over 6 months now. During that time here was a few snowstorms, a devastating fire, earthquakes, a flood that washed out the road, and a lot more.
 
I did an AMA back in March or April and a lot of redditors suggested I start taking videos of the experience, so now I post on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ghosttownliving), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/) about the town. [This video is recap of the 6 months here](https://youtu.be/r9PPgAvXkEY).
 
The 6 months has definitely changed me fundamentally and I plan on staying here full time for the foreseeable future. 
 
Anyway, I’m here hanging in my cabin, and figured I’d do an AMA. So, AMA!

I'm a big believer in integrating psilocybin therapy into American &amp; global culture as soon as possible, to help heal epidemics of depression, anxiety, and addiction.  This therapy helps people to process difficult and traumatic emotions and experiences, break destructive patterns of thought and behavior, and to love, integrate and forgive themselves and each other. People can connect to the deeper spiritual ground of their being and to the miraculous living natural world we are one with.

That’s why we’re dedicating $1 million to the IP 34 campaign to legalize psilocybin in Oregon this year:[ ](https://yesonip34.org/)[https://bit.ly/yesonip34](https://bit.ly/yesonip34)

"I AM A software developer who wants to make it easier for you to move house. I just built a new app called Yazz — Ask Me Anything!"
Hey Reddit,

I'm Chris and I absolutely HATE moving! 

Recently my wife and I were moving AGAIN and struggling to decide between hiring movers to take the burden off of doing it all ourselves, and renting a Uhaul and signing all the paperwork and paying all the extra fees at the end and hauling it all ourselves. We ended up renting a van and just dealing with the pain of moving ourselves, and then to make matters worse, we ended up not having room for one last piece of furniture in the back and had to come back with the Uhaul for a round 2 pick up. I found myself wishing I knew someone with a pickup that could just toss it in the back and be on our way, but unfortunately, no luck there! I knew there had to be an easier way - but it wasn't easy to find.

**So I built it**. I was inspired by apps like Uber and Lyft, and built a similar example — it's called **Yazz** — It's an app that finds a ride for your stuff instead of you. People/ drivers with a van or a pick-up truck get your items from point A to point B the same way you would use a ride-sharing app. Feel free to check it out, I would really appreciate any feedback/ thoughts you guys have!

I'm open to questions on anything, but I've been in the software development and product game for a while and I'd love to hear any stories or anything else.

IAmA mortuary technician in the UK; my job includes eviscerating and reconstructing the deceased during post mortems, and caring for any deceased cases brought into the mortuary. AMA!
Hello everyone,

As the title says, I am a UK based mortuary technician, or APT (anatomical pathology technician). I've worked in NHS hospital mortuaries, and in public mortuaries under the control of a Coroner. 

**A bit of background:** we look after any deceased person brought into our care, and during post mortem sessions, we assist the (sometimes forensic) pathologist by undressing the deceased, removing all of the organs (including the brain if required), and then stitching the deceased up, followed by washing, drying and shrouding. I have worked with decomposed cases, heavily traumatised cases, suicides, a wide variety of ages, forensic cases/murders, and lots of other interesting things.

I am happy to respectfully answer as many of your questions as best as I can, whether they're about our care of the deceased, more technical questions about what happens during post mortems, more gruesome questions about what happens to the human body after death, or anything you are curious about.

I've sent proof of ID and my qualifications to the mods as I'd prefer to stay anonymous, both for personal reasons and in order to respect the privacy of the deceased on whom I've worked in the past, and their loved ones.

Thank you!

EDIT: I’m going to bed now but will answer any more questions tomorrow! Have a great evening everyone and thank you for your interest.

[Crosspost] I am Brandon Thomas, candidate for Tennessee State House District 49. I'm running in a purple district. I would be the first out person in the Tennessee General Assembly and the first Black person to represent Rutherford county in the G.A. AMA
[AMA goes live at 12:00 EDT](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/hmxdoq/i_am_brandon_thomas_candidate_for_tennessee_state/)

Brandon Thomas is running to represent State House District 49 because he wants to model compassion for his son, and ensure that the needs of everyday Tennesseans are no longer placed on the back burner. Brandon has worked in retail customer service, non-profit work, and on campaigns. Through this work, he has honed the skills of building consensus, and working with people from many different backgrounds, while still not being afraid to stand up for what’s right and speak truth to power.

Brandon believes we need to expand Medicaid in the state of Tennessee. We have the ability to access federal money that’s already been set aside for this purpose, which would help provide healthcare access to over 700,000 of our neighbors and stop the closure of even more rural hospitals. We also need to institute a worker’s bill of rights by introducing a slate of bills related to making sure all Tennesseans have access to a living wage, paid family leave, and a proper work/life balance. And we need to reform our criminal justice system, by ending cash bail and making sure that justice is restorative, not punitive.

Brandon was born and raised here in Rutherford county. He graduated from Smyrna High School and MTSU. Brandon is fighting to create a family-friendly economy that works for everyone. No exceptions. Brandon is ready to fight for his community to ensure access to healthcare, to fight for a family-friendly economy, and to fight for equal treatment under the law. Brandon is ready to bring love and compassion back to our legislature, and get to work solving the problems affecting everyday Tennesseans.

You can help us flip this seat by going votebrandonthomas.com to sign up to volunteer and to contribute to the campaign.

National Sex Day is this week! Let’s celebrate – I am Christene Lozano, sex therapist. Here to answer your questions. AMA
***\*EDIT\* (11:30PM EDT):*** **Thank you all for your questions and vulnerability in sharing here. I hope the info shared here was helpful - happy to have been of support. Signing out of the AMA. I will no longer be addressing any further questions or comments. Thanks for having me here!**

Hi there! I’m Christene Lozano, a sex therapist specializing in compulsive sexual behaviors, sex issues, and relationships. I am a Licensed Marriage &amp; Family Therapist (LMFT), Certified Sex Addiction Therapist (CSAT), and currently in the process of becoming a Certified Sex Therapist (CST).

I wanted to hop on Reddit to host an AMA for National Sex Day (June 9th). We live in a society and culture in which many people are both obsessed with sex and also embarrassed about it. While sex is abundantly advertised in the media, many feel shame and have difficulty talking about sex. Even talking about it with your long-term partner can be hard. From desire, masturbation, and porn, to sexual intimacy, orgasms, and sexual trauma – you and your questions are welcome here.

Due to the topic of sex being uncomfortable for many, please be kind and considerate when asking questions and commenting. Stay curious and non-judgmental.

We are Jordan (Republican) and Chris (Democrat), and we went on a road trip together to look deeply at what divides us as Americans, and how we may be able to come together – we learned a lot about the American people and each other! Ask us anything.
We are best friends and co-authors of Union: A Democrat, a Republican, and a Search for Common Ground—a book we wrote about six road trips we took across nearly 20,000 miles of American roads. We (Jordan—a Republican Marine, and Chris—a Democrat and speechwriter) went from a Trump rally in Phoenix and the tear-gas-soaked streets outside, to the decks of a lobster trawler off the coast of Portland, Maine. to jazz clubs near the French Quarter of New Orleans, to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and countless other locations across the country, where we interacted with all kinds of incredible people. Now we don’t fight about politics anymore… much.

I (32M) have Ankylosing Spondylitis for 18 years. AMA
 

Hi. I'm a 32 years old male. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis for more than 18 years (If you don't have much idea about the condition feel free to have a look at the YouTube link at the end of this post). I have literally forgotten how it feels to be without pain. This condition has somehow restricted most of my physical activities. It definitely has a huge impact on the quality and most of my choices in my life.

During my school and university days (I was undiagnosed back then) I skipped most of the classes because of immense pain. I have up played almost all outdoor sports by the age of 20.

It's a progressive condition. There's no cure. Immune suppression can help to reduce the speed of the progression. And that has its own consciences, so I've rejected immune suppression (biologics). I have tried my best to stay as much active I can be. Staying active helps to reduce the progression of the condition. Now I'm 32 and I find it very hard to stand straight. I'm in a hunched back posture most of the time.

I've been in immense pain all over me for almost two decades now. Because there are no external symptoms (no swelling or anything like that) nobody around me bothered. Now that I have this hunched back posture, and can be seen from outside that something is wrong in my body. So I get a lot of attention and people around me keep asking me. I'm used to the pain and the limitations come from it. But I'm not used to this unnecessary attention that I'm getting lately.

If you are still reading this feel free to AMA.

Please excuse my English skill. As you can tell, it is not my language.

My name is Richie Lai, I am the co-founder of Bittrex, one of the longest running cryptocurrency exchanges on earth.

Today I’m joined by a few colleagues and friends to answer your questions about the Bitcoin halving. With the spike in interest in Bitcoin because of the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the halving around the corner, we thought this would be an interesting discussion.

I’ve been involved with Bitcoin since the very early days;  mining in 2011, our first bitcoin business in 2012, and finally Bittrex in 2013. Our business now has millions of users and the Bitcoin Halving aka “The Halvening” has been top of mind for everyone recently.  As the Halvening approaches, we are working 24/7 to support the increased demand—so ask us anything about the Bitcoin Halving!

By the way, in celebration of the Bitcoin Halvening we are also hosting a reddit giveaway of half of a Bitcoin for someone in the USA, and another half of a Bitcoin for someone outside the USA.  Contest details will be shared on r/Bitcoin shortly. 

Joining us today on r/IAmA:

I have only been a full time "professional" for 72 hours, since my girlfriend encouraged me to make my hobby into my living.

My Prices range from £2 for access to all my Patreon content (Podcasts/Polls etc.), up to £115 per session for a party of 7 with a completely customised and unique world.

Hey Reddit! IamA 30 year old woman who was diagnosed with an extremely rare disease known as Budd-Chiari Syndrome that only occurs in 1 in a million people. I am currently awaiting a liver transplant. AMA!
July 27, 2020, my 30th birthday, is that day that my life changed forever, when I found out that I had a condition called Budd-Chiari Syndrome and that I would need a liver transplant. It was caused by an underlying genetic blood clotting disorder. I have to drive 4 hours from where I live to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville just to receive treatment from a physician that has treated my condition. I am very fortunate to be able to even receive such treatment. I have learned so much on my journey. From what an "orphan" drug is, to finding out just how difficult it is to be waiting for a transplant.

Hi all,

So like most musicians, every gig and project I was working on got cancelled and I'm stuck in NYC bored out of my mind. 
I do a lot of improvisation and love taking songs and play them in a whole new style, but I could use some suggestions. 

So, if you ever wanted to hear Sweet Child of Mine played as a corny Bossa Nova elevator music style, or Mr. Brightside as a heart wrenching ballad, that means you're as bored as I am and I love it!

I am Annie Nikunen. I am an NYC-based flutist, composer, dancer and choreographer, as well as sound artist and radio broadcaster for WKCR. On December 16th, i'll be a host for a huge livestream party for Beethoven's birthday!
Hi Reddit!

My name is Annie Nikunen. I am an NYC-based flutist, composer, dancer and choreographer, as well as sound artist and radio broadcaster. As a flutist, I am a founding member of new music group BlackBox Ensemble, and have performed in contemporary, classical, jazz, dance and Taize settings. My compositional work ranges from concert music and field recordings to dance and film; I explore connections between composition and choreography, always considering the physicality of sound in relation to movement and space. I also explore dynamics of human relationships in my work, including cycles of brokenness and healing, and how sound and movement can represent those processes. Ballet was my initial career track, so I vowed to incorporate my love for movement into my work with sound. On the media side, I am a music/dance reviewer for Bachtrack, and served as Director of the Classical Department and Business Manager at WKCR, where I host a weekly show every Friday featuring the music of New York City Ballet as well as choral, orchestral and film works.

I was asked to become a host for the Beethoven marathon on his birthday! So for 24 straight hours we're going to be hosting interviews, performances and greetings from artists and special guests from around the world in dedication to Beethoven!

Hi Reddit! About a year and a half ago I finished my eight year goal of earning every single Boy Scout Merit Badge. Ask me anything!
Proof: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/jpwv9x/hi\_this\_is\_me\_im\_actually\_the\_scout\_who\_got\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/jpwv9x/hi_this_is_me_im_actually_the_scout_who_got_all/)

I started Boy Scouts at about 10 years old after crossing over from cub scouts.  Sometime in my second year, I met a scout who, like I would years later, was about to earn every single merit badge.  I was inspired by him to attempt the same thing, and after eight years of studying, hiking, biking, meeting interesting people, and doing some really tough, fun, and interesting things around the country (and parts of the world), I finally accomplished the same thing.  In total, I earned 138 of the 137 badges offered (one was discontinued and replaced along the way).  It is my proudest accomplishment so far.

And for one quick FAQ:

*What are merit badges and why is this significant?*

Merit badges are awards offered by the Boys Scouts of America for fulfilling various lists of requirements.  They are all so diverse and unique that I can't really give a "typical" case of one, as they range from something simple like learning about fingerprints and taking your own, to biking for long distances (hundreds of miles depending on the terrain you select), to learning complicated topics like Nuclear Science, Drafting, etc.

Of course, doing 138 of them adds a much greater level of difficulty.  You have to get a qualified and registered counselor to sign off that you satisfied the requirements, such as Astronaut Michael Finke who helped me earn Space Exploration and countless other wonderful people who I could list for quite some time.

As far as the significance, as I said it took a bit less than eight years to achieve.  In the 100+ year history of Scouting in America, fewer than 500 people have accomplished this goal.  For reference, the extremely prestigious rank of Eagle was earned by over 60,000 people in the year of 2019 *alone* (I say this not to minimize the award of Eagle Scout, but to provide a frame of reference for how rarely this is achieved).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm excited to do my first AMA!  Ask away, Reddit.

Edit: thanks for all you comments, but I think I'll be headed off for now.  Might still pop in occasionally to answer questions.

More specifically Nolan Matthews and I measured the angular size of Alnilam and Mirzam using the [VERITAS](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/) telescope array located at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona on December 15, 2019. The experiment results presented in the paper were over 10+ years in the making. The paper shows that a previously abandoned technique in the 1970's is way more useful and viable with modern technology.

I am also hosting an AMA on r/space [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/hv9gs3/im_jonathan_davis_i_helped_measure_the_angular/) which goes into more of the technical stuff.

However, I also want to host a more general AMA here to answer any general questions about space science, astronomy, astrophysics, school, how pissed I get at people here in Utah ignoring social distancing and mask guidelines, how I keep myself entertained, how isolating it is operating telescopes on top of mt. Hopkins in Arizona, my crap car, life, the universe, and everything, etc.

I'll also be starting grad school in Astronomy at Cornell in the fall.

I have a website where I post many things about Astronomy at [www.astronomaestro.com](https://www.astronomaestro.com). I try hard to make the posts understandable to the average blog reader, so please look through some if you are interested.

We are staff from the Getty Museum - ask us anything about the #GettyChallenge!
Hello! We're here from the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. When California instituted stay-at-home orders in March, Getty's digital comms team was looking for ways that the public could engage with our art collection online, and the #GettyChallenge/#GettyMuseumChallenge was born! We challenged folks to recreate famous works of art in their own home using whatever they had lying around, and the results have been incredible!

Check out some of our submissions here: https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/getty-artworks-recreated-with-household-items-by-creative-geniuses-the-world-over/, and some media coverage here - https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/28/us/getty-museum-recreate-artwork-coronavirus-trnd/index.html

You guys even created a page for us! https://www.reddit.com/r/GettyMuseumChallenge/

The challenge was inspired by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and a brilliant Instagram account called Between Art and Quarantine, but adapted with the invitation to use digitized and downloadable artworks from Getty’s online collection. 

The challenge was more successful than we'd ever imagined, and is still going strong! We're here with some of the Getty's staff and curators to talk about the submissions (the coolest, the weirdest, the wackiest), and provide some art historical context for the artworks. Ask us anything, and feel free to share your own recreations as well!

EDIT - thank you all for your great questions!! Until next time!

IamA meditation teacher with ADHD. I have also written meditation content for apps (including Calm). AMA (especially meditation questions)
Hey all. My name is Jude and I got into meditation quite young. My parents are Buddhist so I didn't have to look far. I've also been studying psychotherapy and love the integration of therapy and meditation (they have a lot in common actually). I teach at the [Consciousness Explorers Club](http://cecmeditate.com/) in Toronto, founded by [Jeff Warren](https://jeffwarren.org/).

A year ago I couldn't imagine starting a YouTube channel, but given the pandemic and the need for this content and the lack of being able to work in person with people, YouTube became an obvious choice for putting content out there.  It all started with people around me asking where to start with meditation, and me wanting to create free and accessible resources for them.

[YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxo_bHWY3UgI2vAO_7f9VuQ), including beginners courses on how to practice mindfulness/vipassana/insight meditation and how to practice mindfulness in everyday life (also recently did a video on how to cultivate self-love).

Hi Reddit, Hannah, Rebecca, Amy, and Kathleen from the TLC Foundation for BFRBs here. 

This week (10/1-10/7) is [BFRB awareness week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G7ypPjmXAw&amp;feature=emb_title). BFRBs are a group of disorders including hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting among others, and occur in 2-3% of the population. 

For 29 years we've been at the forefront of raising awareness for the common but under recognized and diagnosed disorders, providing community support, and funding research. We raised over $2 million to fund the largest multi-site study looking at BFRBs. We provide educational resources to therapists, doctors, and cosmetologists, and community resources to people with BFRBs including support groups, webinars, courses, and an annual conference. 

We are not doctors or licensed clincians, just a group of dedicated people who want to raise awareness and help others.

Ask us anything about the disorders, our work, the organization. We're happy to answer it all!

[AskHistorians X-Post] AMA with Dr. William Quinn, co-author of 'Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles', here to discuss the history of financial bubbles and crises.
#[Link to AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i2wfsm/i_am_dr_william_quinn_coauthor_of_boom_and_bust_a/)

**As a reminder** this AMA is about the history of finance. Please don't come expecting to ask current events questions, as questions focused on that will be removed as per the rules of the subreddit.

&gt;  Hi everyone! I’m Dr. William Quinn, an economic and financial historian with a particular focus on financial bubbles and crises. My new book with Prof. John D. Turner, Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles, is out on Thursday with Cambridge University Press.
&gt; 
&gt; Financial bubbles are large increases in the price of an asset (usually houses, stocks, or both) followed by a large fall in their price, typically with no obvious cause. Often, this is accompanied by a boom in supply i.e. building of new houses or issuing of new stocks. Some bubbles are fairly benign for the economy, but others precede very severe depressions, leading to mass unemployment, poverty, and other social and economic problems. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our book covers 10 bubbles from throughout history, starting with the first recorded major bubbles of 1720 (the tulips don’t count!). As well as the famous ones -1920s stocks, 2000s houses - we cover some more obscure bubbles, such as the Latin American financial asset boom of 1825, the Australian land boom of the 1880s-90s, and the British bicycle mania of the 1890s. I specialise in bubbles and crises, but feel free to AMA about financial or economic history generally and I’ll do my best to answer!

I Am A professional video game player that has been in the top 0.0001 percentile of WOW, DoTA, Apex, Fortnite, Realm Royale, and Path of Exile. AMA
[https://imgur.com/a/Sfrcw9G](https://imgur.com/a/Sfrcw9G)

Hello! Some napkin math reveals that I have played approximately 70,000 hours of video games. As a 24 year old, assuming I've slept 8 hours a day, I have been awake for only 138,000 hours, which means I've spent more than 50% of my conscious time playing games. When incorporating school, ages 1-8 before I had a PC, meals, human maintenance, etc. you can see that I've done basically nothing else. Most of these hours were spent improving, grinding, or farming for some version of internet points in one way or another-- not necessarily having fun. I'm not sure what drives me. Pick my brain, Reddit!

Edit: Will be answering questions forever. Ask away.

Hi Reddit! I'm the founder of Quarantine PenPals, a business I started during quarantine that connects strangers and friends with postcards. Ask Me Anything!
Hi everyone!

My name is Jeff and I'm the creator of Quarantine PenPals a penpal service that connects friends and strangers across the US.

**Link**: http://quarantinepenpals.com

I wanted to find a way to give back and lift people's spirits during this weird time, and so a couple weeks ago I launched my mailing service.

On the site, users connect with 2 people per sign-up, as their postcard sent to a stranger across the US and they also receive a postcard from a stranger (one sent, one received).

It's been a great learning experience building this service and website during my downtime and our initial customers seem to be loving it. Ask me anything about the service, starting an online business, or anything else you can think of!

A lot of questions were about percentage of proceeds to go to local food banks. I’ll work on adding a tool on the site to show how much money is being donated for transparency. Thanks for your time and feedback (both positive and negative).

IamA: Paramedic in the US
I'm a paramedic working in the US. I have about 10 years of experience in the field. I also have specific training in critical care, and several years of experience as an EMS educator. I have worked everywhere from busy metropolitan areas in Southern California, to rural towns in the Midwest. 

It occurs to me that many people don't know much about EMS, what EMS is, what it is that we do exactly, or how we work. So I am hoping to help answer any questions you have regarding EMTs, Paramedics, Ambulances, etc.

Please ask away. I hope to answer many questions and enlighten people on what the EMTs and Paramedics out there do.

(I welcome COVID response questions, but also encourage non-COVID questions to keep the discussion interesting.)

A few disclaimers:
- I'll do my best to answer all questions, but because everywhere is a little different, I may not be able to answer a question if it's specific to the EMS agency where you live.
- I'm a paramedic, nothing special about me on that scale. There are undoubtedly other paramedics and EMTs here that may poke their heads in. Please welcome their input as well.
- I will not answer questions such as "what's the worst thing you've ever seen" or questions like it looking for gory stories. It's considered disrespectful to ask an EMT/Paramedic/Firefighter/etc that because it's asking us to rehash our worst nightmare. Also, most people don't really want the real answer.

I am Shannon Lee Gilmour. I have saved my family's non-recyclable post-consumer plastic for the last decade. I just finished folding and stringing 1000 origami peace cranes out of non-recyclable post-consumer plastic. My wish is for a positive lifecycle for plastic. Ask me anything.
&amp;#x200B;

My condolences to all those whose loved ones are being affected by the coronavirus, Covid-19. In the difficult days we are experiencing due to Covid-19, I am hoping that collectively we are beginning to see how the world is connected globally, how what one country or individual does can affect all others, and how we are collectively finding ways to work together to build hope for building a healthier world. I know that in each person’s heart there is a desire to do good and care for all that is loved. In the light of that, I hope we can come together to care about and show our hope and love for humanity, children, and the natural world. I want to act with love and caring to support and nurture life. Thus, I have devoted myself to try to find positive lifecycle solutions to plastic waste, for what we do with plastic, good or evil, can last forever.

[I just completed folding and stringing 1000 peace cranes out of clean non-recyclable plastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KreM0n5qlLI)

My wish is for a positive lifecycle for plastic.  Why a “positive lifecycle?”  Plastic is forever. A positive lifecycle for plastic is when mixed-waste plastic is given a beneficial end-use. Instead of having a negative effect on life, plastic could potentially have a positive effect on humanity and when the environment is cleaned and protected from plastics - support life.  Imagine the benefits to the natural world and the benefits to humanity if all plastic had a positive end-use in, for example, architectural constructions we *want* to last forever. I believe, if we come together collectively, we could, eventually, end child homelessness.  

Since 2010, I have saved my family’s non-recyclable plastic.   Seeing how plastic waste was polluting the water and killing life, and inspired by the work of the Pura-Vida Organization in Atitlan, Guatemala, I decided to try to change the way I responded to my plastic waste.  Without a designed solution in mind, I began carefully collecting, cleaning, drying and storing the non-recyclable plastic from my family of four. Two years later, plastic packaging was stored under every bed in every possible cabinet.  My daughter was born in early 2012, and with the demands of a newborn, I found I had to make this process of bottlingup plastic easier.  Using bottles with a larger opening made all the difference.  After searching and finding inspiration in the Pinwheel House of Ying chee Chui, I began to develop the Pinwheel House idea to include plastic waste as a wall component, thus forming an extensible system of architecture for communities to begin to use non-recyclable plastic as a resource.  In 2016, I prototyped the first form of this system, a bus stop.  

[PROOF](https://www.shannonleegilmour.com)

I continue to save all my non-recyclable plastics every day. 

I know developing a positive lifecycle for mixed plastic waste is possible… and becoming more and more essential – as the throw-away default for plastic is damaging to health and wellbeing of all life ….forever.  

If we don’t clean up our mess and our actions – who will?

Do you share my wish?   My hope is to bring like-minded people together, so we can begin to create a more beautiful and healthy world together. 

Begin today - Earth Day, the 50th anniversary, to transform waste plastic into beauty and hope by folding a plastic peace crane with me. Post your creation on Instagram, Twitter, etc. With the hashtags #PEACEWITHPLASTIC, #PositiveLifecycle4Plastic 

If you resonate with this mission and vision – please come and be a part of it. 

Together, we can be the change we wish to see.

IAMA former GOP activist/supporter who started a grassroots movement to vote republicans out of office in November. AMA.
**Background:**

I was voted president of the college republicans for two years in a row, went to CPAC twice, worked in Senator Rick Santorum’s legislative office, worked on his campaign, did door-to-door campaigning in various state and local elections, and registered people to vote. My first vote was for Bush in 2000. My parents still have the picture of me voting up on our wall.

I also used to work in counter-terrorism. [You may remember me from a past AMA I did after the Paris shootings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3t6iog/lets_talk_terrorism_i_am_a_former/) I worked for the City of Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management &amp; Homeland Security where I routinely deployed in support of Pittsburgh SWAT to barricaded suspects, hostage situations, and suspected active shooter events. I also worked as an intelligence analyst in the Region 13 Counter-Terrorism Fusion Center.

**Breaking Point:**

My breaking point came after the Syria pullout. I called Senator Toomey’s (R-PA) office, got a staffer on the line, and asked him what Toomey’s stance was. I was told that, “the senator disapproves of the pullout.” When I said great, but asked what he was going to do about it, I was flatly told, “Nothing.” *Nothing?* I lost it. A senator’s literal job as defined by the Constitution is to check the balance of the executive branch. If a senator openly admits that he disagrees with a major policy decision like this and does nothing, we have a problem. Toomey, as always, has done zero to check the president’s power. Democracy doesn’t work this way. We’re putting our nation’s system at risk.

This isn’t the party I joined. A new conservative party is needed, but until then it’s time for moderate conservatives to build bridges with democrats.

**What I’m Doing:**

The most important thing any disgruntled conservative can do right now is stand up, be vocal, and give other conservatives social permission to deviate from the norm.

While still a small side project, I started a social media campaign called [“Conservatives Voting Democrat in 2020”](https://www.facebook.com/CVD2020/) to achieve exactly this (click for verification). I reach about 600 people each week, most of whom are conservative. It’s small work but it’s good work.

The “us versus them” mentality in the GOP is real and taking a stand can feel like we’re putting our social ties on the chopping block. Yet hiding doesn’t earn respect - honesty does. If you can say what you believe clearly and directly, back it up with sound argument, and stay calm and grounded throughout, you’re good. If our social ties can’t stand the honest truth then we don’t have great relationships to begin with.

**"But you’re a conservative! Why should conservatives vote democrat?! This makes no sense."**

I want change. Because disagreement isn’t allowed in the GOP anymore, I’m pretty much forced to do this. This is why many of us resonate with the phrase, "republican refugees." We're being forced out.

At the end of the day, the GOP only cares about two things: my money and my vote. I can complain as loud as I want, but if I give them these two things they could care less. Holding my money back won’t do anything; there’s plenty of billionaires to take my place. That leaves me with my vote. If I fall in line and keep voting the way I’ve always voted then I’m only going to get more of the same. I already spent years calling my republican representatives with zero success. This is the only option I have left. It’s the only way to do something that might actually make a difference.

**Why I’m here today:**

1. To answer any questions that could aid in “across the aisle” understanding, and
2. To connect with other disgruntled "republican refugees" and let them know that they’re not alone.

We are free individuals who are allowed to vote however we please. These are the rights our nation was built on. It’s time to own our democratic power and use it in the ways we see fit.

I’m doing some editing work that requires my attention so I’ll be popping in and out here in bursts, so be patient if questions pile up a bit at times. Thanks.

Next week is [Asteroid Day](www.asteroidday.org) where we raise awareness about the rocks that regularly zoom past Earth. We are a bunch of European Space Agency (ESA) experts on asteroids here to answer any questions you may have, from dinosaur extinction to asteroid mining and even deflection!

We are:

Paolo Martino – I am ESA’s system engineer for Hera that will be launched in 2024 to study what happens when NASA's DART hits the Didymos Asteroid. We hope to prove humankind can actually deflect an asteroid. Originally from Italy, I spent more than ten years at ESA’s technical heart ESTEC working on several satellites. I have worked on the Hera mission since 2012. I can also answer any questions in Italian. (PM)

Marco Micheli – I am an Italian astronomer, my job is to observe asteroids that may be dangerous to our planet and calculate the risk they pose. I started doing this as an amateur astronomer when I was 16, and then, after a degree in physics and a PhD in Hawaii I was able to turn asteroid hunting into my daily job at ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. Our observations, taken with some of the largest and most powerful telescopes in the world, allow us to measure the position and trajectory of potentially dangerous asteroids, and predict close passages and possible collisions with our planet. I can answer your questions in Italian too. (MM)

Heli Greus – I am ESA’s Hera product assurance and safety manager making sure that after NASA’s DART probe hits Didymos we launch the Hera probe to observe what happens next and map the resulting impact crater after the dust has settled. We will also launch two CubeSats to fly closer to the asteroid's surface. With all this information we can hopefully deflect asteroids that are a threat for humankind. I grew up in Finland but have been working at ESA’s technical heart in The Netherlands for 13 years. Feel free to ask questions in Suomi too! (HG)

Detlef Koschny – I am co-managing the Planetary Defence Office, part of ESA’s Space Safety programme that is working to protect our planet from asteroids, violent solar outbursts and the build-up of dangerous space debris. I have a passion for cosmic dust, meteors, fireballs, and other minor bodies in the solar system, in particular asteroids. I have worked on many planetary missions. Recently, I was involved in a study where we took videos of the surface of our European laboratory on the International Space Station to understand how many micro-meteoroids hit our module. Originally from Germany and now living in the Netherlands, I can answer questions in German and hopefully in Dutch, too. (DVK)

Aidan Cowley – Science Advisor for ESA and materials scientist working on human spaceflight and exploration, including in-situ resource utilisation to enable sustained exploration of other worlds (and asteroids!) by using resources available in space. For example we developed [3d-printing from lunar regolith to build a moon base (http://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Building_a_lunar_base_with_3D_printing). (AC)

A little about me (Adam): I am a longtime producer for GBH’s Antiques Roadshow, PBS’s most watched series, and part of my job is to fact-check our appraisals and make sure everything is accurate before airing. It’s pretty hard not to “go down the rabbit hole” when researching a particularly intriguing or tricky fact, and one day I thought: hey, this would make for a great podcast! Enter DETOURS, a new podcast from GBH and PRX, which I now host.  DETOURS answers the question “what happens to all that stuff after the cameras leave town?” by focusing on one object per episode and diving deeper into the stories, secrets, and surprises behind the finds. 

We’ve dropped two of the six Season 1 episodes so far: Episode 1 focuses on a potential national treasure that turned out to be the hardest fact I ever checked, and Episode 2 follows a Laurel ＆ Hardy prop all the way from the appraisal table to the auction block. What do you have to look forward to in the rest of the season? A call from the FBI, a Sherlock-style radio mystery, a peek into the world of art forgeries, and more.

IAMA brain surgery survivor and I no longer feel fear because my right amygdala was removed along with 10% of my brain.
Edit: Alright that's it for me, I can't believe I just spent 4 hours answering questions haha but it's been fun.
Here's some proof: [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/ejys1t/an_eeg_confirmed_2_years_of_seizure_freedom_since/) [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/fe671i/i_take_my_first_lowered_dose_tomorrow_ill_be/) [\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/7xoc13/hey_folks_my_right_temporal_lobe_is_coming_out_in/)Also here is some \[maybe NSFW? Just scars and brain bits\] pictures of my brain surgery: [https://imgur.com/a/6LoWKEx](https://imgur.com/a/6LoWKEx)

I had my right amygdala removed along with my right hippocampus and the front (anterior)  half of my right temporal lobe. I had two brain surgeries, one to place probes deep in my brain to record my seizures over 7 days, and the other to remove the parts that were generating seizures.

Among several other less-interesting changes like becoming more talkative and having a worse sense of direction, I noticed that I no longer feel *fear*. That doesn't mean I will calmly walk off of a cliff, just that my reason to not-walk off of a cliff is no longer precisely "fear." I am still capable of stress and anxiety, so when I say "fear" I am expressing a very specific feeling. I'll post the long story here and it may answer many of your questions:

It's important for me to define "fear". We use many other emotional terms interchangeably for feelings that are actually quite different. There is a distinct difference between fear, stress, and anxiety. Are you "scared" that you might make the wrong choice (say the wrong thing, buy the wrong product) the same way that you are "scared" if someone were to point a gun to your face? In order to discuss the lack of "fear' let's define those as *different* feelings, not just different *levels* of the same feeling. I'd call the former "stress", and the one I lost is the latter. Thus, if someone were to point a gun in my face I wouldn't be chilling. I imagine I would be VERY "stressed", like the feeling of "I just started on the last question of the final exam and I only have 30 seconds left!", but not "afraid."

The biggest way this has presented itself, having not had a gun pointed in my face, is the fear of my inevitable death. I used to have a hyperbolic fear of my inevitable death, but I still would take risks like skydiving. Perhaps it was the control that I wanted. I would think "I will die one day and there's nothing I can do about it" every 7 seconds for hours. Now that's completely gone. I am just apathetic about my inevitable death. Perhaps a more relatable example would be cliff-edges? I am able to go much closer to the edge of a cliff than I used to, but if I get too close I still feel that "make the wrong choice" feeling, closer to stress/anxiety than the fear I used to feel.

Finally, for those interested, I'll provide a quick rundown of which part does what in the average (right-handed &amp; neurotypical) brain:

**Right amygdala**: Fear, physical response to negative stimuli (including the "fight or flight" feeling),  harm avoidance, speech-inhibition (how much you have to want to talk before you start tallking).

**Right temporal lobe**: Recognizing faces, spatial memory (retracing your steps in space, like where you came from and where you put something), verbal intonation, object recognition.

**Right hippocampus:** Forming of episodic memories for the right-hemisphere. e.g. "\[Who\]  did \[what\] at the \[where\] \[when\] because \[why\]."

I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old progressive medical student running for US Congress against an 85 year old political dynasty. Ask Me Anything!
EDIT 2: I'm going to call it a day everyone. Thank you all so much for your questions! Enjoy the rest of your day.

EDIT: I originally scheduled this AMA until 3, so I'm gonna stick around and answer any last minute questions until about 3:30 then we'll call it a day.


I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old medical student taking a leave of absence to run for the U.S. House of Representatives because the establishment has totally failed us. The only thing they know how to do is to think small. But it’s that same small thinking that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We all know now that we can’t keep putting bandaids on our broken systems and expecting things to change. We need bold policies to address our issues at a structural level.

We've begged and pleaded with our politicians to act, but they've ignored us time and time again. We can only beg for so long. By now it's clear that our politicians will never act, and if we want to fix our broken systems we have to go do it ourselves. We're done waiting.

I am running in Michigan's 12th congressional district, which includes Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Dearborn, and the Downriver area.

Our election is on August 4th.

I am running as a progressive Democrat, and my four main policies are:

1.	A Green New Deal 
2.	College for All and Student Debt Elimination 
3.	Medicare for All 
4.	No corporate money in politics 

I also support abolishing ICE, universal childcare, abolishing for-profit prisons, and standing with the people of Palestine with a two-state solution.

Due to this Covid-19 crisis, I am fully supporting www.rentstrike2020.org. Our core demands are freezing rent, utility, and mortgage payments for the duration of this crisis. We have a petition that has been signed by 2 million people nationwide, and RentStrike2020 is a national organization that is currently organizing with tenants organizations, immigration organizations, and other grassroots orgs to create a mutual aid fund and give power to the working class. Go to www.rentstrike2020.org to sign the petition for your state.

My opponent is Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She is a centrist who has taken almost 2 million dollars from corporate PACs. She doesn't support the Green New Deal or making college free. Her family has held this seat for 85 years straight. It is the longest dynasty in American Political history.

Hey Reddit! My name is Paolo Cattaneo. 5 years ago I quit my job, sold everything I had and embarked in a trip around the world on a motorcycle. Rode for almost 185000 km (115k mi). Still going! Here to answer question about self sustained living on the road and long distance solo travelling. AmA!
Hey there! 
I am Paolo, italian born but Australian resident since 2010. 
I am here for my yearly AmA, trying to break down some mental barriers and answer some questions that arise usually when we see somebody travelling long distances unassisted.

SHORT BACKGROUND STORY OF MY LIFE:
Born and raised in low-middle class family, in a small 2000 people town, 20km outside of Milan, Italy.
My mom was housewife and my dad was selling honey for a company, to provide for the whole family.
Public schools all the way up to University. Chose computer engineering. Graduated with average score.
I had to work since the age of 15. Small weekend jobs to have some spare cash. At 18 started to work in a consumer electronic shop and a pizza place. 
By the time I was 24 I saved just enough money to buy myself a plane ticket to Los Angeles. 
Managed somehow to stay in USA and come back only 3 years later, with no money whatsoever. 
In 2008, I found a stable job with a renowned IT company, in Milan, Italy. 
I put my head down and managed to work for 2 years, before quitting my job in 2010 (yes, in the middle of the world economic crisis) and moving to Australia.
I left for Australia to find better work conditions and better remuneration (basic italian salaries are very low compared to cost of living).
I found a temporary gig in Sydney and then got officially hired, after 6 months, by the same company I was contracted by in the first place.
After 2 years, I was done paying and worrying about my residency permits and continued to work as hard as I could for another 3 years.
In 2015 I saved enough money to buy myself my dream motorcycle, a camera and had saved enough money to sustain myself for a while. 
I decided then to quit my job and ride around Australia on my motorcycle. My initial plan was just to ride around the continent and go back to work.
After 8 months and a hell of an experience, I decided to continue my journey and go around the world.
I shipped my bike from Australia to Chile and started riding around south america. 
After 1 and a half years, I crossed to central America and started riding around North America. After another year I decided to fly from Canada to Ireland, and started riding around Europe. 
I left Italy, on my way to Mongolia, in February and rode through the Balkans, when Covid happened.
I got stuck in Greece for 4 months and now I am back to my family home near Milan, Italy.

I ride a KTM 1190 adventure 2013 model, which I bought second hand in Australia.
Same bike for the whole trip. No mechanical or electrical issues in the whole trip.
AMAZING Machine!

I am a Californian with the fires 10 minutes away from my house AMA
Hi Reddit,

I am a 16 year old who lives in San Jose, California. As said in the title, the fires are only ten minutes away from my house and we have received an evacuation warning. From what I have been told in online school, if our area is to be evacuated, people will come knocking at our door and we will have an hour to leave. Yesterday, the sky looked like nuketown from bo2 zombies and had an air rating of 194 (unhealthy) to above 200 (very unhealthy). Today is a lot better, with the air quality being 157 (unhealthy), which still sounds bad but the air is actually somewhat breathable and there is only a slight smoke smell.

CEO and Founder of Basepaws does AMA
Hello internet! We hear you love cats ;) Us too -- we are 100% cat people. 

My name is Anna Skaya, and I founded Basepaws -- the world’s first at-home DNA test for cats. Think of us as 23andMeow (or 19andMeow - cats have 19 chromosomes to our 23 chromosomes). We are LA-based, science-first, consumer cat company. Small but mighty, we are here to bring more focus on cat care, health and genetics. In summary - we want being a cat parent to be cool :)

*Here is what we are about:*  [*https://youtu.be/LgZv6S632to*](https://youtu.be/LgZv6S632to)

We are also pioneers in feline genetics, an area that has been understudied and underfunded, especially compared to other pets, and people. Cat genes hold many unsolved mysteries - from why your cat purrs to their love of catnip - and that's where we come in. Genetics can help answer those questions! With our ever-growing genomic database, we are constantly learning new information about cat breeds, traits, and health. We're doing all of this with one larger-than-life goal: to improve the lives of cats around the world by understanding what makes each cat unique. 

*Want to know more? Check out our FAQ’s here:* [*https://www.basepaws.com/faq/*](https://www.basepaws.com/faq/)

The team and I designated this Reddit channel to gaining a greater understanding of our pawrents and Base-kitties! Yes, we LOVE cat puns, you’ll have to forgive us. I’m here to help answer questions you may have regarding cat breeds, report features, health markers, etc.

IAmA science writer who spent the last few years researching questions like Who Ate the First Oyster? Who Drank the First Beer? Who Shot the First Arrow? Who Invented Clothing? and profiling the individuals responsible for these and many other ancient discoveries and disasters. AMA!
Hi Reddit! I’m Cody Cassidy, a science writer who spent the last few years researching and writing a book called [Who Ate the First Oyster?](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2110332/cody-cassidy) profiling the people responsible for prehistory’s greatest discoveries and catastrophes. I interviewed everyone from archeologists to geneticists to brew masters about who might have eaten the first oyster, worn the first pair of pants, caught the first case of smallpox, invented soap, first rode the horse, and the other geniuses behind the greatest prehistoric inventions and discoveries.
 
In the process I discovered the first inventor was probably a young mother, that the person to eat an oyster not only possessed a bold palate, but may have also made one of the greatest astronomical observations in history, that the person who invented clothing may have been more interested in fashion than function, that the bow and arrow probably began as a toy, that we may know what the inventor of the wheel first called their invention, that the person responsible for more human death than anyone who ever lived may have simply breathed in the wrong speck of dust – and much more.
 
I also wrote a book called [And Then You’re Dead](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/531818/and-then-youre-dead-by-cody-cassidy-and-paul-doherty-phd), which answers questions like what would happen if you swam out of a deep sea submarine, were swallowed by a whale, your elevator cable broke, you parachuted into Jupiter, and many other equally cheerful scenarios that would most likely kill you.
 
Ask me about prehistoric inventions, their inventors, the physics behind strange ways to die, or anything else!

I've been a competitive figure skater from the age of three. Ask me anything!
Hi reddit! I'm not very good at this, so let's hope I'm doing it right. 

I'm Georgie, and I'm a nineteen year old figure skater. I became a USFSA gold medalist at the age of fourteen. I have competed in singles for fourteen consecutive seasons, as well as five seasons doing synchronized skating, and I have experience in both solo and partnered ice dance. I have also done some professional work, appearing in TV episodes of "Sesame Street", "Instinct", and "Mysteries of Laura", and various skatewear modeling jobs. I am a performing apprentice with the Ice Theater of New York, and I have appeared in some of their exhibitions, both as an ensemble member and a soloist.

Downpour Interactive - Developers of the Virtual Reality FPS game Onward
Hi Reddit, we are Downpour Interactive.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago our founder, Dante, quit college to build his dream game in virtual reality: a tactical first person shooter titled Onward. Over the past couple of years the game has grown as it found an ever increasing player base, and the studio expanded with it.

Yesterday, we released Onward as one of the first traditional multiplayer First Person Shooter games on the Oculus Quest, and we have big plans for what's next (although we can't talk bout that yet). Today, we kick back a bit and answer all your questions about video game development, running a video game development studio, working with a remote and international team, and our game Onward.

We also have a few people from our publishing partner Coatsink with us, who will be happy to answer your question about game publishing!  We're starting this AMA at 11AM PDT!

&amp;#x200B;

Ask us anything!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for your questions, we've enjoyed reading through them, and unfortunately couldn't answer all of them for various reasons. Be sure to check out Onward on your VR platform, and we hope to hear from you in the future!

[X-Post] AskHistorians 2020 Conference Panel: Being the Change That Others Don’t Want: Asserting and Resisting Racial Hierarchies in Mid-century North America Q&amp;A
AskHistorians is hosting its first ever [online digital conference](https://www.askhistorians.com/2020-digital-conference) this week! We have a whole slate of exciting talks and accompanying AMAs with the panelists.

#First up for our final day is [Being the Change That Others Don’t Want: Asserting and Resisting Racial Hierarchies in Midcentury North America Q&amp;A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9HqeP_OSAw)

This panel examines strategies, language and culture of protests and counter-protests in the United States and Canada centered on the subjects of Fascism and Race. It focuses on a variety of actors engaging in protests and counter-protests, on questions of framing and re-framing protests and agendas as well as on reaction and reflection of social upheaval. By asking questions about language, effectiveness of protests and the role of so-called moderates, the panelists present a historical perspective on subjects that are evermore present and urgent in this very age.

#[Click through here for the AMA with the panelists](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iui1ea/being_the_change_that_others_dont_want_asserting/)

&gt; Moderated by **Johannes Breit** (/u/commiespaceinvader), this panel features:
&gt; 
&gt; **Tyler Wentzell** (/u/tdwentzell), presenting his paper, **“Fascists in Hogtown: Toronto’s Reaction and Resistance to the National Unity Party during the Summer of 1938”**.
&gt; 
&gt; *For most of the Great Depression, Canada’s fascist parties were small, marginal, and disunited.  While the Parti National Social Chrétien had achieved a public presence in Montreal, similar organizations on the west coast, the prairies, and Ontario were small in membership and influence.  They mostly lurked about in secret meetings in members’ homes.  This changed in the summer of 1938 with the establishment of a National Unity Party (NUP).  The NUP united the disparate nationalist parties; openly recruited soldiers, ex-soldiers, and police; and held a public rally at one of Toronto’s largest venues: Massey Hall.*
&gt; 
&gt; *This paper examines how Torontonians reacted to the “arrival” of the NUP that summer.  Specifically, it examines the tactics employed by a disparate anti-fascist movement, how city officials publicly responded to the free speech debate, and how some members of the local militia and police openly supported the NUP.  Drawing upon personal papers, organizational records of the resisters, legal records, and newspaper accounts, this paper concludes that while many vocal Torontonians were vocally opposed to the NUP, the majority were indifferent or even supportive of its stated objectives.*
&gt; 
&gt; **​Ryan Abt** (/u/kugelfang52), presenting his paper, **“Everyone I Don’t Like is Hitler: The Appropriation of Anti-Nazi Axioms by American Fascists, 1944–1949”**.
&gt; 
&gt; *In the 1930s and early 1940s, American educators perceived group hatreds as a significant danger when facing the growth of Nazism. They believed that the Nazis succeeded in coming to power and in conquering enemies through “divide and conquer” techniques. These methods fostered group antagonisms, which weakened the Nazis’ enemies. In response, educators seized upon intercultural and unity education to defeat the subversive effects of what they saw as imported “Nazi racial ideology.” These efforts found significant purchase in educational curricula between 1933 and 1945.*
&gt; 
&gt; *By the end of the war, however, organizations, which such educational initiatives had denounced, due to either their embrace of fascism or demagogic intolerance, began to use calls for unity to silence progressive educators. Decrying charges of bigotry as divisive, conservative educators depicted intercultural education as communist “divide and conquer” subversion. They, thereby, reoriented Americans’ understandings of Nazism by focusing on the methods of totalitarianism and ignoring its specific ideological components. This realignment submerged the racial components of the Nazi atrocities and silenced efforts at drawing parallels and lessons in U.S. society.*
&gt; 
&gt; ​**Dr. Megan Hunt** (/u/Dr_Megan_Hunt), presenting her paper, **“Bringing the Millennium to Birmingham: To Kill a Mockingbird and Racial Protest in Alabama’s Magic City”**.
&gt; ​
&gt; *On April 3, 1963, residents of Birmingham, Alabama woke to triumphant newspaper reports of “a new day” penned by mayor-elect, Albert Boutwell. Touting himself as a moderate, Boutwell was a segregationist: unlikely “to bring the millennium to Birmingham”, according to Martin Luther King, Jr. For the city’s Black population, barred from downtown employment, this “new day” signified “business as usual”. Boutwell celebrated his victory immediately, at the city’s segregated premiere of* To Kill a Mockingbird. *Across town, and willfully ignored by those at the premiere, April 3, 1963 marked the beginning of “Project X” a consolidated effort to draw attention to the city’s entrenched racism as part of a national push for civil rights legislation. Images of city police violently confronting young protestors would cement the city’s reputation for racial hatred and brutality, but ultimately force President Kennedy to acknowledge civil rights as a “moral issue”.*
&gt; 
&gt; *This paper argues that the election, premiere, and Project X offer a composite image of the city’s culture and self-image as it entered a defining era of “chaos, revolution, and change”. April 3, 1963 afforded glamour and celebration for some, as other residents began to storm the barricades of a segregated citadel. The Magic City, as inhabited and imagined by each group, could not have been more different.*

We are political activists and policy experts fighting to prevent the government from spying on your Internet activity without a warrant. Ask us anything!
You’ve probably read some recent headlines on r/technology and r/news about the US Senate voting to allow the American government to continue spying on everyone’s Internet activity without a warrant. Unfortunately, it’s 100% true and it’s 1,000% awful. But we have a chance to stop it from happening. Support from tens of thousands of people across America convinced House leadership to schedule a vote on important privacy protections this Wednesday.
 
If you want to help save Internet privacy, you can visit [SaveInternetPrivacy.org](https://www.saveinternetprivacy.org/) where you can send an email to your lawmakers asking them to save Internet privacy. You can also call Nancy Pelosi’s office directly 1 (202) 930-8115 and ask her to save Internet privacy by supporting the Wyden-Daines amendment. 
 
There’s a lot of momentum behind this political movement. Tech companies like Reddit, Mozilla, and Twitter have all signed on to [an open letter](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/05/22/protecting-search-and-browsing-data-from-warrantless-access/) demanding that Congress support common-sense privacy protections. And a lot of lawmakers really want this amendment to pass. To make that happen, they need to know that this issue is very important to a lot of people just like you and me. So visit [SaveInternetPrivacy.org](https://www.saveinternetprivacy.org/) now and tell them how you feel.

Hi Reddit, Boxcarbobbythehobo here. In the news this week, there has been a ton of coverage about potential Federal overreach when it comes to the protest occurring all over the country right now, and I wanted to stop by and share my own experience. 

A bit about me: I was not always a good person. I grew up in Houston, in a poverty stricken community, riddled with drugs and crime. I got caught up very early in gang related stuff, and by the age of 17 I was already in prison for a gang related fight. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Folks from my neighborhood almost never got an education; Most got prisoner numbers. I was one of the lucky ones who got an education IN prison. As I began to delve deeply into political science and history, an activist was born. Upon my release 7 years later, I was fully committed to using all of my time and energy to organize and try to fight so much of the injustice I had witnessed in the justice system. I organized all over the country, from Working on the Bernie Sanders campaign twice, in 8 states,  to working to ensure Maine's Ranked Choice voting effort proved successful. It is no overstatement to say my whole life revolved around trying to help people.

I am also the father of a black son. The death of George Floyd hit me particularly hard. I dunno how common this knowledge is, but Mr. Floyd was a hero in this community.  He was a Football hero, who also was a member of DJ Screw's legendary Screwed Up Click. The music of Screw was such a huge part of Houston's culture. 

I was arrested three times during the George Floyd protest. They arrested me the first time trying to march onto the freeway. I was held for a day and released. HPD officers followed me around downtown houston for over 3 hours, until the rolled up on me with three unmarked police cars, re arrested me for no new crime, and enhanced my charges. I made bond, was out for three days, when the FBI kicked my door in 20 deep and arrested me again, again for no new crime. They kept trying to make me say I was antifa, and that there were hundreds of people who followed me. I am not antifa. I am the father of a black son who I dont even know how to explain why I am going through what I am going through to. 
I am currently on GPS monitoring (for a whopping 6 dollars a day!),  being forced to go to rehab for my "marijuana addiction", and wont know my future for awhile, so I just thought I would stop by and talk about it with you guys.

I’m Dr. Nick Wagner, child psychologist and child development researcher. AMA about parenting during the pandemic and supporting children’s changing needs.
I am Dr. Nick Wagner, assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Boston University. I research child development and the enduring impact of early experiences, relationships and social environments (i.e., parent-child relationships, peer relationships, school contexts) on children’s social and emotional development. The goal of my work is to produce translatable knowledge to inform the creation and evaluation of methods for supporting children’s healthy emotional and behavioral development.
 
Ask me anything about:

 - How should I talk to my child about the pandemic?
 - How is the pandemic impacting my child’s social, emotional and/or cognitive development? What can I do to help?
 - What activities should I introduce to my child’s daily routine?
 - How can I support social interactions for my child – while staying safe?
 - How can I reduce my child’s pandemic-related stress?
 - What can I do to make my child less scared and confused during these uncertain times?
 - I’m noticing a behavior change in my child during this time – is this normal? What should I do?
 - My child is acting out more – how should I handle this?
 - Tips for remote learning?
 - How can I maintain my own well-being while supporting the needs of my family?
 - Do you recommend any alternatives to screen time activities/entertainment that my child can engage in independently?
 - How can I balance parenting with my career during this time?
 
My recent research has been published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Child Development, Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness, Attachment ＆ Human Development, [Neuroscience ＆ Biobehavioral Reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/neuroscience-and-biobehavioral-reviews), Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment, Psychological Medicine, Clinical Psychology Review and more.

Hi, I’m Keshia Clukey, a reporter covering the coronavirus pandemic in New York state. AMA!
I cover law, healthcare, government, and taxes in New York state for Bloomberg Law. I’ve also covered the state for other outlets including Politico New York. I’ve been following the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak since the state had its first confirmed case reported on March 1. New York is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., with more than 345,000 positive cases and over 22,300 virus-related fatalities.
 
Like most reporters, I’ve been working nonstop to provide readers with real time updates as the state closed down, and now as it works to reopen, a complicated process with many components. I’m happy to answer your questions about the effect the virus has had on the state, the reopening, and what’s next.
 
When can you get a haircut? How many people are out of work? Will my kids get to go school in the fall? AMA about what’s happening in New York state!

I started a reddit-based business inspired by my annual RedditGifts participation! In 2018 I was the #1 rated gift and 2019 I gifted Adam Savage. Now I'm unemployed and working full time on my puzzle solving company Lockbox Adventures AMA!
I have participated in the RedditGifts exchange annually for the last 5 years. Four years ago I decided to send someone on an adventure around town, so I sent them a locked safe with their gifts inside and sent them on a journey around town to collect the numbers to the safe. It went over well (better every year) and in 2018 it was the #1 rated gift. I even beat out Bill Gate's gift!  

&amp;nbsp;  

After that I founded Lockbox Adventures where I sell a smaller offering loosely based on that concept. The plan is to offer a travel-based game much like my annual RedditGift experience, but today I sell tabletop games which don't require travel.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I just got laid off from my day job, accepted into an accelerator program (like an incubator) and am now working full time on the business. This is a dream come true (even though its tough). Feel free to really AMA!

IAmA Self-Published Author, Artist, Musician and Graphic Designer. Ask me anything about creativity!
Hi guys! My name is Abe and I am a 21-year-old guy who just loves creativity. 

1) I have self-published two science-fiction novels. The series was inspired by a dream I had when I was 12. I published the first book, *Inner Sanctum: Reality,* when I was 18, and I published the second book, *Inner Sanctum: Rise,* when I was 20 just before I started college.

2) I am also an electronic musician who released my first album two years ago. I have recently released several singles, the first of which has received 14K views on YouTube (not a million, but it was my first single under my new alias, which in my opinion isn't too bad). I also sing, play the piano and beatbox. I come from an evangelistic family and am a part of my dad's music ministry (I sing harmony). 

3) I am currently studying graphic design. I've done a lot of design work for my personal projects, particularly with my music. I did some design work for a record label and for other electronic musicians. Prior to the shutdown I was working at a co-op doing graphic design work. I got a call from my boss saying that he'd like me back, even though our co-op session was over for the year! I was super excited!

Ask me anything, particularly when it comes to creativity.

Hey Reddit,

Figured i'd jump on and answer some questions about my job and see what misconceptions there are out there. I am a Navy Electronics Technician (Nuclear Power) Senior Chief Petty Officer.  I have served on 3 different classes of submarines in my 18 1/2 years of active duty. I am a Navy Nuke, so any questions about the recruiting process as I remember it and those schools are fair game as well.  I've been stationed in Georgia, South Carolina, Idaho, Washington, and Hawaii, and have visited Japan, Guam, Diego Garcia, the Seychelles, and Singapore.

Outside of the Navy I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and a bit of a political junkie, looking to make my mark in politics for Washington State once I retire from the Navy.

Hi Reddit! I'm the founder of GetAPenPal, a website I started during quarantine that connects people through digital letters. Ask Me Anything! \(^-^)/
Hello there! \^-\^)/

My name is Maksim and I am the creator of GetAPenPal - a social network for finding penpals from around the world!:D

**Link**: [www.getapenpal.net](https://www.getapenpal.net)**Proof:** [https://imgur.com/a/zRnRJhO](https://imgur.com/a/zRnRJhO?fbclid=IwAR2WtX18dj2MWL-CbVrMSh9naDQ6AofKgu3W159d_7lYoa7cFXNhRlHjX_A)

**======= A bit about why I started this project =========**I have been writing letters to people from around the world ever since I can remember, and I love every aspect of it.

I get a kick out of **checking my mailbox every day.** That's because I know the letter I receive will be packed with **insights about people's lives, languages and culture.** That each letter is an opportunity to **broaden my horizons.**

Writing letters gives me time to **re-think, organize, and structure my thoughts** before laying them out on paper. This slower way of communicating is like an oasis in a desert of instant communication. **Not getting interrupted** gives people permission to open themselves up more and creates a **more honest channel**. The fact that someone had to **invest time and energy** into crafting and sending a letter makes me feel **important and listened to**.

I am naturally **shy and introverted**, but penpalling helped me **get over my shyness** and gave me a chance to meet people from around the world. People I would otherwise **never cross paths with.**

There is one friendship I am particularly proud of. One that goes two or three years back. One that lead to us meeting in person after so many years of exchanging letters \^-\^

These letters &amp; stamps are **physical means of capturing that present moment**, to which you can come back to and read years later.

*This was my attempt to put in words what penpalling is for me.*

I am so lucky to have had a chance to meet so many amazing people and form such strong bonds. But I would be even happier if more people could do so too. Since I am a programmer in love with penpalling, confined by quarantine, noticing the need for this all around me... I decided to put my projects on hold and to build a website where people can meet penpals easily all over the world. The website I still in active development and will be for a long time.

But most importantly, **I built GetAPenPal with all these points in mind.**

From the ground up, the website is made to **facilitate thoughtful conversations and meaningful friendships.**

**Ask away!:D**

I am Don Vultaggio, Founder &amp; Chairman of AriZona Beverage Company. AMA
Hello! Thanks for having me. I am Don Vultaggio, Founder &amp; Chairman of AriZona Beverage Company. I look forward to hearing from you all, today.

Here is a little bit about how I ended up here:

I broke into the beverage industry in the early 70's as a local beer distributor. I went on to build a beer business, Hornell Brewing Co. We were very successful but I wanted to offer something to a wider audience...

In 1992 I had the idea to start selling iced teas bigger and better than anyone out there… literally! We packaged our tea in a never-done-before Big Can and started with AriZona Lemon and Raspberry Iced Tea. We then went on to create Green Tea and Arnold Palmer, among many other AriZona products you know and love. It was very exciting to see the fans love and support, in such a big way. 

In 1998, we introduced the the 99-cent suggested price point to the packaging label. We still pre price them 99¢ to this day. My goal was to bring quality and quantity to the masses for an affordable price and the rest is history!

We produced our first AriZona Tea on May 5th in 1992 and today we are celebrating our 28th anniversary! Thanks to our employees, loyal fans, and retailers we now sell AriZona worldwide in over 50 countries.


Despite our global growth, we remain family-owned and operated and plan to keep it that way. My son Spencer is helping me write these responses. So, don't be shy, ask me (us) anything about our history, favorite AriZona beverages, about building a business or more.

Hello. To all the DC Comics fans out there, thought this could be fun! Miguel Ferrer, David Ogden Stiers  (Mash) and John Kassir (The Crypt Keeper) were all in this TV pilot. Warner Bros had high hopes for this planned series. They pitched it as NBC's "Friends" meets The Justice League ...It never aired but was bootlegged all over the world.

**My short bio:** In 2001, after years of saving, my parents took my two sisters and myself on an 8 month trip around the world. During that time I was almost kidnapped in Africa, gave out Christmas presents to poor villagers in Peru and watched my dad get stopped for looking like a terrorist after 9/11.

Hi, I'm Dalesha Richardson, A Legally Blind Woman Who Has Been Sharing Her Life On YouTube Since 2016. AMA
Hi Reddit. My name is Dalesha Richardson and I have been showing how I go through life as a legally blind woman, along with my also legally blind boyfriend Manny, on my YouTube channel "Dalesha's Life" since the summer of 2016.

In 2016, when I decided to start this journey, my goal was to dispel the various misconceptions that surround legal blindness. I knew that traditional methods of teaching people were antiquated and didn't have the desired effect since those misconceptions and presumptions still existed back then.

I thought that making fun and entertaining videos that showed how Manny and I did our day-to-day tasks would be a much better way to reach an audience that would normally not be reached through those traditional, antiquated teaching methods. Over the years, we've grown and in addition to our typical, day-to-day tasks, we've shared our experiences traveling, cooking, clothes shopping, and house hunting.

In addition to the above, there was another reason why I started this channel. The US government has a special category for people with legal blindness in almost every governmental program. This categorization says that if you can prove that you are legally blind, you are automatically eligible to receive assistance. If your federal government believes that you are incapable, why wouldn't the general public feel the same way?

Regardless of the obstacles, Manny and I find alternative routes. Today, we continue to share our life together in the hopes that the preconceived assumptions of inability that most have of people like us will eventually disappear.

Opening up a dialog is always helpful in situations of discomfort and uncertainty so please feel free to ask me (or Manny) anything!

IamA (Musician, overbearing r/PAN streamer and the founder of HopefulCases, a charity using music to combat homeless and the way we think about giving. AMA!
My name is Will Boyajian, the founder of HopefulCases, and the big ol' mustached face you've be seeing on your r/Pan feed.  

HopefulCases is a NYC based charity founded in 2017, where musicians would play music in the streets with a sign that read "If you're homeless or need help you can take as much money from the case as you need". Our musicians are volunteers. We get to play our music, people get help and a friendly face. It's a sweet system. 

We used to spend hours and hours playing underground in the subways. 

Since the pandemic has made it impossible to play in public, we've taken to the airwaves.  Playing music on streaming services, and directing those who need help to simple ask through out website. We're not here to judge, we're here to give. Asking for help is hard, but it doesn't have to be. Sometimes you just need a little help from a neighbor to get out of a hole. We try to be, and encourage others, to be that neighbor. 

We stream every weekday on r/pan at 11am and 3pm Est. 

If you need help, you only have to ask:

I am Benjamin Lorr. I write non-fiction about the weird world we live in, and just finished a book about the grocery store! AMA.
I am an author and teacher who writes about beautiful corrupt things (i.e. normal life). I just finished a book called The Secret Life of Groceries which is a wide ranging look at Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and the American grocery industry. I rode with truckers, worked the fish counter at a Whole Foods, followed entrepreneurs trying to bring their products to market, and traveled to Myanmar and Thailand to understand the bottom of the shrimp commodity chain. Before that I wrote a book, Hell-Bent, that explored the inspirational obsessive world of Bikram Yoga. For that I competed in a pair of lil black yoga shorts at the National Asana Championship, explored yoga history, and was the first to report on guru Bikram Choudhury's abusive, manipulative, and predatory relationship to his students.

Hey all, I'm Michael Lingzhi Li, part of the COVID-19 effort at MIT CovidAnalytics. We are a group of researchers from the [MIT](http://mit.edu/) [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), led by Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/). We developed many tools to help combat the COVID-19 crisis, including:

* Painstakingly collating results from over 190+ research papers to create data visualizations that would be helpful to the public/medical community
* Developing a plan for transporting ventilators across the US
* Creating a mortality + infection risk calculator to help doctors know what patients are likely to be more critical, and what patients are likely to actually have COVID-19 (without testing)
* Developing projections and evaluating governmental policies for over 130 countries/regions in the world.

I am in particular in charge of the projections and the policy evaluations around the world. Our projections on April 3rd was that there would be 1M+ *detected* cases by end of May in the US, making us one of the earliest groups to predict with reasonable accuracy. (To be fair, even we thought our numbers looked a bit high...)

I will relay the questions about the other work we have done to the appropriate team members and let them answer. :)

I'm Carole Turek, a 70-year old photographer, and my quest is to photograph every hummingbird species on the planet! So far I have photographed 150 of 350+ species. In February 2020 I climbed 18 miles up a mountain in northern Colombia to photograph one of the rarest hummingbirds in the world. AMA!
My name is Carole Turek and I have been consistently feeding hummingbirds for 25 years.  My home in Studio City, California now attracts hundreds of them daily.  There are so many hummingbirds here now that I decided to share them with the world on a live cam.

&amp;#x200B;

I began photographing my birds and my passion for photography grew to where I had to find more species of hummingbirds to photograph.  I started with trips to Arizona, but to find more and more beautiful hummingbirds to photograph, I had to start traveling to Central and South America.

&amp;#x200B;

My last trip before all travel came to a halt was to northern Colombia to photograph the Blue-bearded Helmetcrest, one of the rarest hummingbirds in the world.  To reach this critically-endangered hummingbird one must seek permission from the indigenous tribes and then trek up to an elevation of 10,000 feet to arrive at the last remaining territory of this hummingbird.  The bird is so rare that it was thought to be extinct until five years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Less than one hundred people alive have seen it (there actually is an "I've Seen the Blue-bearded Helmetcrest Club") and only a handful of people have actually photographed one.  We have created three episodes to show the world our journey to the páramo at the Lagos de Sevilla in the Santa Marta Mountains of northern Colombia, where the Blue-bearded Helmetcrest can be found.  You can watch these episodes here:  [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNVQIhPFF34), [Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UFnTnasbAs), [Day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iTDA4MZBAM).

&amp;#x200B;

All of my past and future photography trips are being documented on my [YouTube channel, Hummingbird Spot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9WO9hqKmaAccZqCgeOw4w). So far I have photographed 150 of the 350+ hummingbird species that are scattered over Central and South America.  We will be traveling from the Amazon rainforest to the peaks of the Andes Mountains!  Come with me!

I’m a US service member deployed since October 2019.
I’ve had to watch my family go thru this insane shit storm of a year and I’m still not due back for a few more weeks.  Everything from Iran’s threat in January up until the protests had me more worried about my families safety than my own despite being stuck in the middle of a desert (thanks coronavirus).  

I guess ask me anything (keeping OPSEC in mind) but I more wanted to vent that I haven’t been able to be there for my family through this insanity.

It's nothing special, but its mine. I did everything myself aside from the music (I purchased the music track at audiojungle.net). The game has 3D graphics, physics based gameplay, and it's all built in Unity.

You try to keep a ball in the air as long as you can by swiping to shoot pillars up out of the ground. I added coins to collect, fun skins to unlock and achievements to earn. It does have ads but I decided to make them optional for in game rewards. Only watch them if you want to.

I recently started attempting to learn Russian. I knew that there were websites that offered parallel books, (books that allow you to read translations as you're learning a new language) and I wanted the same for practicing typing.

Here is an example of one of the books with parallel typing tests: https://btype.io/game/1931/1

I ended up doing more than the minimum though, and the website actually works for anyone wanting to just practice typing with books in any language.

Hi. I’m a Former Professional Tiger Trainer - Ask Me Anything
Since Tiger King is such a cultural phenomena I thought it might be interesting to see if anyone has any questions about that particular profession from a less sensationalistic viewpoint.  

Over the last few years I’ve run an off-leash dog walking company in California, so I’m currently mostly removed from exotic animal training.

From 2005-2007 I attended the Exotic Animal Training and Management program at Moorpark College. That particular school is one of a kind, and graduates work everywhere from zoos, aquariums, hollywood, guide dogs for the blind, etc.

I worked at a Six Flags theme park doing an  (IAAPA) award winning free contact tiger show from 2007-2010. The park discontinued our show and retired our cats to their safari park at the end of 2010.

I don’t know any of the players in the Netflix doc personally, but have known about Carole Baskin and ‘Doc’ Antle for years.

I almost posted this last week and then saw someone who was on that show posted and figured it wasn't a good time.  Questions about working with tigers, exotic animals, in a theme park, etc will be most up my alley, but if you want to ask me about the goings on on Tiger King, please give me specifics as I am not well versed on it.

[Here are numerous photos.](https://imgur.com/a/6lKbkD4)

[And here is a video showing off the variety of experiences at that spectacular job](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9Scyt7TjQ70&amp;feature=youtu.be) (from MC'ing the show to training athletic and husbandry behaviors, to interaction with some happy big cats).

I am a [Female] Bodybuilder and porn star on steroids ask me anything,
 

This is a ask me anything about anabolic steroids. or to do with my porn career, I make cash through a vast source of incomes, from my adult work, from gyms I own and run personally, and A fair few other investments i've put my money into. there is a few reasons i'm doing this ama the reason for the porn side is I get a lot of questions asking me what it's like, what I do, it is crazy, is it sexy? sometimes, sometimes it is pure work and there is parts like any job you hate/dislike i've met some awesome people and ive met some complete muppets. on the anabolic side of things the reason for doing this is simple, I normally always post in the other boards. But I commonly get messages from women wanting to lose weight, build muscle, or even use anabolics steroids, I also get questions from men curious or asking about their girlfriends etc. Over the years I have been a variety of sizes, I have been the level of a female bodybuilder, I've been 105lbs and ripped/lean, I've been skinny, and originally I was over weight at 260lbs, I had PCOS and struggled a lot when I was younger, I got down to around 110 before I ever touched drugs using heavy weights and cardio along with an excellent diet, this is to answer any questions you might have, I have used a lot of gear, I have made mistakes, And i'm here to share it all, I've had 100s of clients over the years, Women who want to use steroids to get huge no matter what the cost! something I wouldn't do. But I respect everyones decision, I've had some wanting to get big but look as feminine as possible, others wanting to get ripped/lean, some just wanting to be models. I know 100s of girls who lie to their partners, steroid usage in women is far more common then one would have you believe. I know girls who are as feminine as can come hiding their anavar and primo in the bottom of yogurt for example. unfortunately many ladies will deny it or just not be honest with it. so there is a lot of bad information spread via steroid usage. With the photos, I've done the one as proof to verify myself, then with the others ive put a vast amount, the ones at the top are what I use to look like. when I was over over weight, to when I was a more skinny weight, to when I started bodybuilding, the first attachment is my training photos and the ones at the bottom of it are how I currently look now, the ones above/top are the different stages of my training career so you get an idea of the sizes i;ve been, now im going for a bit more feminine look, And looking at some possible facial work, fillers, lips, and possibly fat transfer to the face as ive been interested in the look, but I may not do all of them. Current work i've had done is breast enlargements obviously. anyway everything in the first link is safe for work. the second link is a few photos to the more adult type. i'd like to say i've kept it classy, but how do you keep porn classy? what i;ve done is put photos that are not explict or completely revealing, so that is not "offensive" material, Ie there is no penetration/dildo/oral/spread legged photos etc. and done my best to keep it as sfw on the second link as possible. but common sense with the type of work I do, viewing the first one is fine, the second one I would not view at work. and would still label it as NSFW I just didn't want to put my extreme photos in there and take away from what im trying to do.

as stated I am here to answer ANY QUESTIONS, As long as it's not rude or stupid, I'm happy to answer anything as indepth as I can.

Hi, IAMA journalist who made a book about men with eating disorders. AMA!
\-- Trigger warning. For people who affected by eating disorders or other mentally fragile conditions; scrolling through this post might revive your own, painful, memories, so please consider this before reading it. --

Hi Reddit! So together with the amazing photographer Mafalda Rakoš (Austrian, 27) I, Ruben de Theije (Dutch, 24), have worked the last 2 years in our free time co-initiating a project about men with eating disorders. Eventually we ended up interviewing and portraying 11 men from Austria, Germany and the Netherlands who were bravely willing to open up about their current or former struggles with anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder or OSFED (Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder). Their stories are collected in a book, A Story to Tell, and in exhibtions throughout Europe.

\- Some articles about it. [German book review](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG9-Z-HnGI7/) , [GUP Magazine - English](https://gupmagazine.com/interview/mafalda-rakos-a-story-to-tell-or-regarding-male-eating-disorders/) , [Burn Magazine - English](https://www.burnmagazine.org/essays/2020/03/mafalda-rakos-a-story-to-tell/) , [Volkskrant - Dutch](https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/mannen-met-eetstoornissen-zijn-bang-niet-als-mannelijk-gezien-te-worden~b786ad39/) , [RTL Nieuws - Dutch](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/editienl/artikel/5113211/stigma-mannen-eetstoornis-anorexia-boek) , [AD - Dutch](https://www.ad.nl/tilburg/anorexia-alleen-bij-vrouwen-rijsbergenaar-bewijst-tegendeel-met-boek-de-interviews-waren-soms-heel-heftig~a923cf59/) .

This is by the way the second time I post this, but the last one rightfully got deleted after 5 minutes a couple of days ago (I didn't follow the guidelines for providing the proof, sorry my bad). So this is the second try!

Since it's quite a hidden topic I'd like to show Reddit that these issues exist. This is also the reason we started this project. Beforehand, as a small disclaimer: I'm not a psychologist nor mental health professional in general, so some questions about personal situations I will not answer, due to the fact that professionals can provide better help for this. But what I can do is share our findings and summarize the experiences of the protagonists (of which some of them now work as mental health professionals, helping others with recovering from eating disorder). In general, to just give a better understanding about this topic! Which is definitely necessary.

So shoot: AMA about the project, topic or just life!

EDIT 1: Guys, sorry but after a long day it's sleeping time! Tomorrow I'll wake up a bit earlier to answer some of your questions still, so you can definitely still send them in. I will try to answer as many as possible. Thanks for your interest, question and all the kind words. I didn't expect it to have so many comments and upvotes, so that's really amazing! Have a nice day/night all and take care!

EDIT 2: Thank your for all your questions, I did answer some of them quickly this morning. If you're interested in ordering our book, you can do it on [our website!](https://astorytotell.info/Shop) Unfortunately I'm not able to answer all of the questions, because I have a busy schedule coming up. But if you suffer with personal issues or are worried about people in your environment, please reach out to a professional. They will listen, help and ease the pressure from you. You are not alone in this. Thanks for sharing questions, experiences and kind words. I'm glad the post did what it was meant for! Take care.

One of the questions during my previous AMA six years ago was: "What do you believe to be the greatest threat against the US?" My answer was eerily prescient: "Collapse from within - the increasing polarization of our domestic politics. We need to find common ground and work from the middle outward, not from the extremes inward."

Well, six years later things have only gotten worse. I'd be happy to take another stab at this and other questions you might have. Ask me anything!

Hi Reddit, I’m Ariel - a social worker by day, inventor by night. I have invented a doormat that sanitizes shoe soles and reduces the number of germs, bacteria and dirt entering your home, office, school, medical facility, etc. 

Shuzon is a two-sided doormat that dispenses cleaning solvent to sanitize shoe soles on one side and dries them for further cleanliness on the other. Research at the University of Arizona found 440,000 units of bacteria on a single pair of shoes. Research has also shown that shoe soles contain more bacteria than a toilet seat.
 
A CDC study found that as ICU medical staff walk around the unit COVID is tracked all over the floor, as indicated by the 100% positivity rate from the floor in a room that held no patients. Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of ICU staff shoes tested positive. The CDC has since released statements saying COVID spreads via infected shoe soles.

I am Toni, with an eye, just the one and I've recently been diagnosed with cancer for the 3rd time time, this time its likely to be incurable so I am making preparations to die at age 30. Ask Me Anything
I was first diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the tear gland in 2016 and my right eye was removed, I recovered well but in 2018 it relapsed locally and I had further surgery and radiotherapy. I then recovered again and believed I was clear for a second time, however this year I have been told its metastasized to my lungs, the layer of fat under my skin, bones around my ribs and spine, liver and, after several seizures this month, I have been told its in also in my brain in several areas. It has spread so fast and so far it is unlikely to be possible for anything to work in the way of a treatment however I am having chemo in an attempt to hold it off. Coronavirus had stopped the opportunity for me to get access to a trial so I am just holding onto what I can control.
I am grateful for the opportunity to prepare as many people do not get this especially at a young age and I am making the most of what time I have left, sending gifts to friends and family, taking plenty of photos for the children and ensuring they have plenty to remember me by. 
I am posting this again as I didn't post my proof well enough the first time around, I am sharing my Instagram page with you all as proof but I have also posted on Instagram mentioning this AMA so hopefully this time, this will post OK.

Hello, I'm Professor Lorraine Whitmarsh from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and I’m a climate change psychologist, Director of a climate change research centre and an IPCC lead author. Ask me anything.
Hi Reddit, I'm [Prof. Lorraine Whitmarsh](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/lorraine-whitmarsh) from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom.

For the past 20 years, I have studied how people respond to the environment and environmental issues. I am particularly interested in what people think, feel and do in relation to climate change, and how we can encourage [public engagement and behaviour change](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781849775243) to help reduce our emissions and adapt to climate change impacts, like floods and droughts. My research projects have included studies of energy efficiency behaviours, waste reduction and carrier bag reuse, perceptions of smart technologies and electric vehicles, low-carbon lifestyles, and responses to climate change.  

For the last 18 months, I’ve directed the UK’s [Centre for Climate Change &amp; Social Transformations (CAST)](https://cast.ac.uk/) which aims to understand the role people can play in tackling climate change and develop more effective ways of changing behaviour, organisations and policies to reduce carbon emissions. I’ve also recently been an expert lead for [Climate Assembly UK](https://www.climateassembly.uk/), the UK’s first citizen’s assembly on climate change, which brought together a representative group of 108 members of the public to explore and debate climate change solutions and produce [recommendations](https://www.climateassembly.uk/report/) for how the UK can reach ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050. 

I regularly advise governmental and other organisations on low-carbon behaviour change and climate change communication, and am a Lead Author for the [IPCC’s Working Group II](https://www.ipcc.ch/working-group/wg2/) Sixth Assessment Report.

We’re medical experts with the American Heart Association who helped develop the newly published 2020 AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. Ask Us Anything!
Hello, Reddit! We’re Ashish R. Panchal, M.D., Ph.D., Alexis Topjian, M.D., M.S.C.E., Khalid Aziz, M.B.B.S., M.A., M.Ed.(IT), Adam Cheng, M.D., and Katherine M. Berg, M.D. We’re medical experts who helped the American Heart Association to develop the newly published 2020 American Heart Association/Emergency Cardiovascular Care CPR guidelines.

Cardiac arrest – when the heart suddenly stops beating – results in death 97% of the time in the United States when it happens outside of the hospital setting (which is most of the time). Yesterday, the American Heart Association published its updated guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. The guidelines focus on the need to tackle health disparities and opioid-related incidents as well as early bystander and AED intervention, which remain key to the Chain of Survival. They also provide an extensive review of updates to evidence-based recommendations for CPR and emergency cardiovascular care training and response.

Key updates to the guidelines include:

•	New recommendations for recovery following CPR, which emphasize the physical, social and emotional needs of patients and their caregivers after survivors leave the hospital;

•	CPR training that now includes guidance on responding to victims of opioid overdose; and,

•	Suggestions for increasing lay rescuer CPR rates, noting that currently less than 40% of non-hospitalized adults experiencing cardiac arrest receive layperson-initiated CPR before the arrival of emergency medical services.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the 2020 Guidelines outline 491 recommendations specific to adult, pediatric and neonatal life support, resuscitation education science and systems of care. In addition to the updated and new written guidance, algorithms to help triage care were updated to reflect the latest science, and several major changes were also made to improve the visual training and performance aids.

**About the Experts:**

About Dr. Adam Cheng: Dr. Cheng is a Calgary-based professor at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute of the University of Calgary. Dr. Cheng is the chair of the resuscitation education guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care

Dr. Topjian also serves as an assistant professor in the department of anesthesia, critical care and Pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Dr. Topjian is the chair of the pediatrics guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.

Dr. Ashih Panchal: Dr. Panchal is an associate professor of emergency medicine for the department of emergency medicine at The Ohio State University. Dr. Panchal began his career as a researcher completing a Ph.D. in cardiovascular physiology at Case Western Reserve University. Following this, he completed his medical training and residency at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Dr. Panchal is a member of the American Heart Association’s Emergency Cardiovascular Care Scientific Subcommittee and is the chair of the adult guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.

About Dr. Khalid Aziz: Dr. Aziz is a Canada-based professor at the University of Albert and works in the Department for Pediatrics. Dr. Aziz is the chair of the systems of care guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.

We are digital rights advocates from the Electronic Frontier Foundation opposing the EARN IT Act, supporting CDA 230, and opposing backdoors to encryption. Ask Us Anything!
UPDATE 2:15pm: The cats that run the Internet need our attention, so we have to get back to work. Thanks for joining us and for all the great questions! Sign up for our EFFector newsletter to stay in touch with us and to know more about our work: https://www.eff.org/effector

////

We are lawyers, activists, technologists and lobbyists at [the Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world. We champion user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development. We work to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows.
 
But recently, Members of Congress have mounted a major threat to your freedom of speech and privacy online. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) recently introduced a bill that would undermine key protections for Internet speech in U.S. law. It would also expose providers of the private messaging services we all rely on to serious legal risk, potentially forcing them to undermine their tools’ security.
 
The so-called [EARN IT Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-act-violates-constitution) ( [S. 3398](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3398/BILLS-116s3398is.pdf) ) is an attack on speech, security, and innovation. [Congress must reject it](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill).
 
Join us to discuss the ways that the EARN IT Act would be a disaster for Internet users’ free speech and security. Ask us anything about the EARN IT Act, CDA 230, or encryption. We will be answering your questions starting at 1 p.m. PDT on Wednesday, June 3, 2020.

We are parent educators who empower parents to talk to their kids about sex. - AMA
**\*\*\*Thank you all so much for a great weekend with amazing questions and great conversations.  We tried to answer all of your questions.  We are sorry to have missed some.  It was not intentional.  You can find all of the answers to these questions and many more in our course "Not. The. Talk."  Our mission is to give parents the words (through scripts, anatomy graphics, animated videos, and evidence-based audio that is also fun and engaging.  We hope you will join us if you are interested in more information on this critical topic.  We are here for you and want to help.  There is so much great information here, if you scroll through it.  Or our course is a one stop shop for all of the answers on basic to challenging conversations with kids about sex, relationships, puberty, and so much more.  We also have a great community of course takers having these very conversations and supporting each other.**    

[**http://ohmywordconversations.com/**](http://ohmywordconversations.com/) **(for more information) or** [**https://oh-my-word.teachable.com/p/not-the-talk-course**](https://oh-my-word.teachable.com/p/not-the-talk-course) **(to buy the course).  We are also about two months away from launching a free podcast.\*\*\***

We are Kristin Dickerson and Shannon Deer.  We own Oh. My. Word., where we empower parents to have difficult conversations to equip their children for the journey ahead.  Specifically, we teach parents to talk to their kids about sex.  We use a framework - Readiness. Facts. Honesty. - to help parents assess their child's readiness, teach them the facts, and answer with honesty.  We encourage parents to convey their own values to their children, so our answers to your questions will not include our values.  We can include a variety of values we have heard from other parents to help you think through your own values.

No question about talking to your kids about sex, anatomy, puberty, childbirth, normal childhood sexual behaviors, concerning childhood sexual behavior, healthy relationships, etc. is off limits.  We have heard it all!  Note: We are not here to give adults advice on their sex life (or to be vulgar or answer vulgar questions).

IamA homesteader living off-grid in Vermont. AMA!
Hey Reddit,

I did an AMA a year ago about living off-grid and homesteading in the Vermont countryside (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d0h5il/iama_person_living_offgrid_with_her_family_in/). With the pandemic, I see a resurgence of interest in leaving the city and homesteading. AMA about our lifestyle, how to settle somewhere without a trust fund or winning the lottery, gardening, etc.

Note: Off-grid = not connected to or served by publicly or privately managed utilities (such as electricity, gas, or water) 
We are not 'off the grid' as depicted in movies about unstable people deciding to fall off the face of the earth and not take part in human interactions :)

I'm Gianna Toboni and I spent the summer reporting on the Boogaloo Bois for VICE News. They say they're preparing for a revolution - AMA
What’s up, peeps. Excited to chat. Here’s a little bit about me. I like to fish. I’ve been lucky enough to travel the world making documentaries for VICE, Showtime, HBO and Hulu on a range of subjects— transgender children navigating their medical and social transitions across America, Saudi sisters escaping their abusive family, forced marriages and country’s archaic guardianship system, Egyptian tomb raiders selling artifacts to support their families, American mothers fighting a broken criminal justice system after experiencing years of domestic violence, and of course, American militias defending their right to bear arms and challenge government overreach. I first started spending time with militias in 2014. I went to their military trainings, joined them on conservative talk radio and even camped with the III%ers in Texas. For this film, I hung out with the Boogaloo Bois in Virginia. Let’s chat! @giannatoboni 

The modern militias episode of [FRINGE NATION](https://youtu.be/cTpZv34txu0) airs Monday at 10p on VICE TV.

IamA 30 year old female born with a rare genetic skin disorder called Epidermolysis bullosa subtype junctional AMA!
October 25-31 is EB awareness week. 
Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of rare genetic skin conditions that result in easy blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. Blisters and wounds can be caused by the slightest of touches, the skin is very slow to heal. It is usually referred to as the “worst disease you’ve never heard of” or skin as fragile as “butterfly skin”

There are different subtypes and severities. While I am mostly able to live as an independent adult, EB very much consumes every aspect of my life. 
I was born and raised in the United States, immigrated to Canada in 2015 and have had a vastly different experience in the health care system regarding my quality of life. 
There is no current cure, treatment for EB consists of bandaging the skin for protection and preventing infection as best as possible. 
For more info visit www.debra.org 
Let’s talk about it!

I am James Veitch, mediocre prop comedian ＆ professional golfer. One day I decided to start replying to email scammers, and I put the funny and often weird exchanges in my new book DOT CON. Ask me anything! (except stuff I find embarrassing or isn’t in keeping with my “public persona.”)
Hello I am James Veitch. I have a book of scams “coming out” and the publishing company have said doing an AMA is a "good idea” while strongly implying if it doesn’t sell I’m being held solely responsible. Anyway, here I am. I am the scam guy I am guy who “did the thing with the ducks.” I feel this is the sort of thing where about ten people will show up like the time I drove all the way to Bristol for a book signing only to find no one had shown up. This is the sort of thing my agent tells me “not” to “mention.” We shall see. 
 
Reddit have provided a helpful “information deck” containing “examples and pointers on AMA assets” which I have not read. They also said in this intro I should “feel free to include links to youtube” so here’s [something I did recently that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejWfGFvzpKg) I’m quite proud of.*

Oh and I should mention THE BOOK. It’s called Dot Con (super clever name imo) and it’s basically an american reprint of an old book I did but it has some new scams in there and it’s hardback and it’s available in the USA. It’s the sort of thing where you should probably buy multiple copies, it’s a great book for [next occasion] and a great gift for all the family. You’ll want to own two or three at least. 
 
I did an audiobook too and so that will be available at some stage. I don’t know when though because after I recorded it I got this email back from the producers complaining that I was "*disrespectful*” because I “*read a chapter whilst eating*“ 
 
But tbh I found this very funny at the time and I think I only did one take so that must be on there.
 
Anyway, ask me anything.**

* insofar as I made it and I think it came out well. The current sitch has really established that what I do is not tremendously important in the big scheme. 
 
 **  Except stuff I find embarrassing, humiliating or where the answer could set in motion a chain of events that would probably lead to some sort of end of days/career nadir. I’ll pretend I haven’t seen those questions.

Original Post: We all suffer from anxiety, this is a normal and natural part of being human but sometimes, it can become too much for us, and this is the time when many of us turn to therapy for answers. Though we approach our work from very different theoretical perspectives, we both incorporate mindfulness techniques when treating anxiety.

Many think of mindfulness as another word for meditation but it is so much more than that! True, we can practice mindfulness in many types of meditations including breath-work, body-scans, and guided meditations such as the loving kindness guided meditation, but there is so much more! We can use our 5 senses, the natural world, mindfulness around our feelings, and mindfulness with our thoughts. 

Have you used mindfulness for anxiety or stress? Do you feel high levels of anxiety and want to learn some tools to help you with it? What have you tried? What works? What doesn’t? We’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Let’s talk about it!

Dr. Morgan Levy is a licensed psychologist who provides online therapy in the state of Florida. She has a doctorate degree in clinical psychology and completed her dissertation on mindfulness. In addition, she specializes in psychodynamic therapy. 

Catherine Saxton-Thompson, MPH, MSW, LCSW is an online ACT therapist with over 15 years experience in the mental health profession (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a unique therapeutic approach that incorporates mindfulness and values.) She serves clients in several states, including Florida, as well as internationally.

I'm the first person in history to dive to the bottom of all five of the world's oceans, as well as climb the Seven Summits and ski to both poles. Ask me anything!
I’ve long had a passion for exploration and after spending over twenty years intensively mountain climbing, I was able to scale the "Seven Summits" as well as ski to both the North and South Poles. In 2003 I retired from the US Navy Reserve after 20 years and had developed a strong affinity for the ocean. Fortunately, I had become financially successful investing in industrial private equity and was looking for a difficult challenge that required a lot of unique resources. I happened upon an important milestone humankind had not yet accomplished: going to the bottom of all five of the world's oceans -- in 2014 we had only been to the bottom of one! After a five-year intensive effort, my team was able to precisely locate, map, and then get me down to the bottom of all five. We have continued our explorations in 2020 with dives in the Mediterranean and Red Seas and are headed back to the Pacific for more diving in the Mariana Trench. Ask me anything at all.

I’m Jacob Goldstein from NPR’s “Planet Money.” I just wrote a book called “Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing,” which traces the surprising history of banks, markets, and money from clay tablets to the invention of cryptocurrency. AMA about the past, present or future of money!
In 2011, my colleagues and I went on the radio show This American Life to ask a question: What is money? Ira Glass called it “[the most stoner question](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/423/transcript)” he had ever posed on the show. Maybe. But some stoner questions are good questions!

I liked this question so much I wrote a book about it. It’s called [Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing](https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/jacob-goldstein/money/9780316417181/), and it comes out today.

What counts as money (and what doesn’t) is the result of choices we make, and those choices have a profound effect on who gets more stuff and who gets less, who gets to take risks when times are good, and who gets screwed when things go bad.

I’ve been making podcasts and radio stories at [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/people/375864395/jacob-goldstein) since 2010. My most recent show was about John Law, who I write about in the book. Law was a gambler and convicted murderer who escaped from prison, brought modern money to France and became incredibly wealthy -- until he destroyed the country’s economy. 

Earlier in my career, I was a reporter at the Wall Street Journal, the Miami Herald, and the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. 

In addition to answering questions about money, I’m happy to talk about Planet Money, journalism, podcasting, etc. 


Proof: https://i.redd.it/k7tpscnhvzk51.jpg

Thanks for the great questions!  

One last thing: If you buy the book and want me to sign it, just DM me your receipt and address on twitter @jacobgoldstein. I'll send you a bookplate signed to you (or whoever) that you can stick in the book.

Today is [World Bedwetting Day](www.bbuk.org.uk/world-bedwetting-day).  In honor of that, I want do some outreach and answer questions.  

I'm a guy in my late 30's. I have a wife and two young children. I have no general disabilities (though I do have some chronic medical conditions).  I've wet the bed irregularly throughout my whole life, with some dry periods, but 8 years ago I started wetting the bed regularly again, which hadn't been the case since about 3rd grade, and I had to start wearing diapers again on a daily basis.

I'm a moderator for r/adultbedwetting and r/adultdiapers, and I'm kind of a self appointed advocate for adult bedwetters on Reddit. I think adult bedwetting is more common than most people realize ... AMA.

I am an Activist that yelled during an international Mormon broadcast to condemn their protecting of Sexual Predators. I was charged and eventually convicted of “disrupting” a meeting for my actions. Ask me anything!
I’m Crystal Legionaires a queer trans former Mormon who decided on April 2018 to yell during the semiannual conference for Mormons called General Conference, video here https://youtu.be/f119uA7k5sk

This was in response to a woman telling that she had been raped at the Provo Missionary Training Center. I have family that have been abused and have had that abuse covered up by the Mormon church so that resonated with me. 

This was covered in local media and I was interviewed as a part of an AP story that was covered by nearly every major US publication and some international publications. 

6 months afterwards I was charged with a Class B “disrupting a meeting.” I fought it to further shine line on the issue but ultimately lost this January being charged with an infraction, $340 fine and a ban from Temple Square for a year. https://www.abc4.com/news/activist-who-shouted-stop-protecting-sexual-predators-during-latter-day-saint-general-conference-found-guilty-of-disrupting-meeting/

While the case didn’t go to plan I stand by my actions and look for other ways to help address the epidemic of abuse that happens in the Mormon church.

I am a Disney Cast Member returning to WDW after 4 months of being furloughed, ask me anything!
[proof](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bedposts/comments/hrhlxr/ama/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I'm a Cast Member at WDW, specifically Hollywood Studios and I work in Merchandise. I won't say where but at this point I've kind of worked everywhere. I've worked in all the parks and I *was* working my way through getting to all the resorts before COVID happened. Now I may not be able to :(

I've also worked at both waterparks! Blizzard is the best and I will fight you over it! 😤 

Back during March we got hit with the extremely sudden news that our CPs would be leaving us. The entire day was the absolute worst. Everyone was constantly crying and panicking, many CMs were ICPs and were worried they'd have no where to go after they were more or less evicted, especially because at the time we were under travel bans/restrictions.

It was an incredibly hard blow to us as workers and took us all by surprise. I guess it didn't really occur to me how serious COVID was until that happened. 

Shortly thereafter we all were furloughed for months. Unemployment was incredible and also the worst experience ever. Some of us, like me, were fortunate in that everything worked out and we got our money no problem. The other half of cast members are still unable to buy groceries and haven't seen any money whatsoever. 

I was recalled back a few weeks ago and last week was my introduction back into the company. Tomorrow is our opening day so really...I guess I should've posted this later but I suppose I'll do an update if people want. 

I've never really posted on reddit before so hope this works!

Former Director of Admissions for the Drama department at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. AMA!
Greetings! I'm Chris Andersson. 

I  am the former Director of Admissions for the Drama department at NYU Tisch  School of the Arts (12 years!) and am now an independent  educational consultant who advises students who want to pursue an education in theater, film, or dramatic writing. I work primarily with high school students who have their eyes on university-level or summer high school programs in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada. To serve them in the best way possible, I founded [Nothing But Drama](https://www.nothingbutdrama.com/) in 2014.

In my role as designer, producer and host of the audition process for the  largest undergraduate theater department in the world, I welcomed **25,000** young theater artists to their artistic reviews (aka auditions) in my time at NYU and auditioned thousands of applicants myself.

Just  the idea of a college artistic review can be overwhelming, scary, and  stressful. It’s a big unknown after all — for every high school senior  in the arts. I'm here today to answer any questions you might have about  the process.

And if you are—or you have—a **theater, film or dramatic writing student** dreaming about studying their art at university, [drop me a line!](https://www.nothingbutdrama.com/)

Take care! And thanks for being here!

I am an Administrator in the Department of Corrections AMA!
Hi Reddit! 

I have seen some discussions lately on the criminal justice system, and I wanted to have a discussion about our prisons. I have nine years of experience \[2 years as a correctional officer and 7 years in classification\]. I have experience in most aspects of the prison system, from work release programs to being a manager of an administrative segregation/solitary confinement unit. I have worked at a maximum and a minimum security prison. My answers will be based on my experience within my state's correctional system, but I would love to answer some questions for people that are curious about what occurs within the fences. I am hoping to answer your questions as well as maybe learn some things from others.

I am Dr. Liz Tyson, Director of the Born Free USA Primate Sanctuary, the largest primate sanctuary in the United States. At our primate sanctuary the mission is to provide monkeys as high a quality of life as we can. The 175-acre sanctuary, located in south Texas, provides a safe, permanent home to more than 450 monkeys, many rescued from abuse in roadside zoos or as pets in private homes or retired from research.

I staffed at the National BSA Summer Camp during a Pandemic AMA
I was one of the many "Blueberries" that worked the Summit Bechtel Reserve, one of the BSA's four High Adventure Bases and home of the James C. Justice National Scout Camp. Not only was this year different because of the pandemic but it was our largest non-jamboree year ever in terms are participants.

I was one of the many first time staffers this summer! I worked from June until August of this year working between the Scout Camp and High Adventure side of camp. Summer camp had to be changed greatly because of the on-going pandemic so we didn't end up like this [hell hole](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/coronavirus-children-camp.html). AMA about how camp had to be changed, camp life, what I did on my time off and more!

I’m Joan Ryan, a sports journalist. I became obsessed 10 years ago with figuring out what team chemistry actually is. Turns out it’s not so different from romantic chemistry. I wrote a book about it. Ask me anything!
Thanks for everyone who joined me today! Loved chatting with you all!

I’m the author of five books, including the expose Little Girls in Pretty Boxes about the abuse of young female gymnasts and figure skaters. My new book is Intangibles: The Science and Soul of Team Chemistry. The book pulls from tons of research ＆ more than 150 interviews with players, coaches, neuroscientists, biologists and more. Spoiler alert: I conclude that team chemistry is a biological construct whose only function is to elevate performance. As one player described it: “Teammates bring out a fight in you that you can’t willingly summon for yourself.’’

I am enjoying this, and thank you all for the offers of getting groceries and such. You're a nice lot. ------- I am going to take a quick break and repot my pepper plant. get some of this lovely sunshine. I will unquestionably come back and answer any and all of your questions. Thank you again, you've been really nice and pleasant to chat with.

update 19:20 uk time. .. .. . 

i repotted my pepper plant, and found a strawberry plant in my garden! good stuff. 

im back and will be working thru answering these questions/comments/etc. i got a hot toddy and a itchy trigger fingers, so lets get into it lads. 


#Final edit : 

This has been a wild ride. You guys are so kind and inquisitive. I’ve really enjoyed my time answering the questions and digitally meeting all you. 

To put a big cherry on top of this thread I am absolutely flabbergasted to say that someone reached out to me and has purchased me and my wonderful soon to be a brand new mattress. I know you all wanted me to set up a go fund me, and I did! But I’ll shut it down and money will be refunded to the donators. I can’t quite put into words the kindness and how it makes me feel. How this thread played out, and how little hatemail I got despite it skyrocketing yesterday into the Reddit hive mind. I am humbled, and frankly PROUD, to be part of this community. I, like you, will survive this weird weird 2020. 

May your evenings be blessed with cotton candy skies, warm breeze, and the sounds of life once again. We will be okay. Humans have lots of shitty traits, but it’s a vocal minority. In general, most of us are pretty decent people. We just want to be loved, and feel like we exist for a reason. For me, that manifests in a few different ways. And one of them is being able to communicate with such a spread of different people, like this thread. It’s been my pleasure to chat with you all, and have some level headed conversations.

Please consider donating to the cystic fibrosis trust, they are doing wonderful work. 

And to all my fellow cf patients, deep breaths. And one foot in front of the other. We may die, but we will leave a mark in the people we meet along the way. Try to remember that we are jaded and angry, sometimes, but not to project that onto the people around us. I know I have trouble with that. 

And on that note, it’s been a wonderful thread with you all. Goodnight, and good luck. See you at the pub.

The Pollination Project is doing an AMA right now! (x-post r/Vegan)
**Link:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/j6xz66/live\_now\_ama\_with\_our\_special\_guests\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/j6xz66/live_now_ama_with_our_special_guests_the/)

🐮 **The Pollination Project (TPP)** ([u/pollinationproject](https://www.reddit.com/u/pollinationproject/)) is a vegan foundation that offers seed funding to grassroots activists working to build a kinder, more compassionate world for human &amp; non-human animals.

TPP focuses on early stage ideas and funds individuals directly. Over the years, they’ve seen the power of bottom-up, community-led grassroots activism. Through “pollination philanthropy”– a democratic model of peer-to-peer decision-making — TPP works with a global network of grantees, community partners, and volunteer advisors to identify extraordinary project leaders who, due to the grassroots nature of their work, are often not in a position to receive funding from other foundations or institutions.

They make micro grants 365 days a year to grassroots global change agents and have a growing global community of 4,500 grassroots leaders in 150 countries. They support vegan outreach projects around the world, and have a special program for farmed animal activists in Brazil, India and Mexico. Their goal is to offer not just seed funding, but capacity-building support and connectivity with other activists working in the same geographic or issue area.

Hi Reddit! IAmA double above-knee amputee &amp; mountaineer. Iam the first DAK to summit a mountain over 6,000m. Iam Hari Budha Magar. Ask Me Anything!
**UPDATE - still checking in &amp; answering questions over the weekend, please keep them coming!**     

Thanks for visiting my AMA! 

Below is a brief summary of my background, if you haven#t got time for that, here is a TLDR video TLDR: https://youtu.be/qa8BDnkOADI      

I was born in a cowshed at 2,700m in Nepal, I grew up having to walk barefoot each day to go to school and to get drinking water. I was forced to marry as a child and spent my teenage years surrounded by brutal a civil war. 

When I was 19, I joined the British Army with the Gurkhas. I served with them for 15 years until I stepped on an IED whilst on patrol and lost both my legs. My life changed in an instant. I joined the Gurkhas prepared to die for the cause, but never considered the possibility that I would suffer the kind of injuries that I did.

Since my injury I have battled to regain my confidence, this was a huge challenge both mentally and physically. A big part of this was many different adventure sports, I was the first disabled person to ski in my native Nepal, and one of the first to kayak around the Isle of Wight. My main passion now is climbing mountains. 

So far, I have summited:     

⦁	Mont Blanc (4,810m)    
⦁	Kilimanjaro (5,895m)     
⦁	Chulu Far East (6,059m)     
⦁	Mera Peak (6,476m) (became 1st ever DAK to summit a 6,000m+ peak)     

Upcoming Expeditions:     

⦁	Himlung Himal (7,126m)
⦁	Mount Everest (8,848m) - There has never been an attempt from a DAK.

Climbing Mount Everest was my childhood dream, but it has become so much more than that for me. I want to use the Everest expedition to prove that Nothing is Impossible. With this expedition and my mountaineering in general I want to do two things:
1) Inspire as many people as possible to go out and conquer their dreams. 
2) Raise awareness for, and change the perspective on disabilities. 

**TLDR: https://youtu.be/qa8BDnkOADI**

Feel free to ask me anything about my childhood in Nepal, my time with the Gurkhas, my injury or recovery, my adventures &amp; mountaineering, the challenges I have faced, climbing Mount Everest, or other upcoming plans. Not to say everything else is off-limits, but that should be enough to get this started...

I am Aneeqa, a research scientist in nuclear fusion! Nuclear fusion - friend, foe or faux? AMA!
Hi there! I’m Aneeqa and I am a research scientist in nuclear fusion and during my career I have worked at one of the largest scientific projects in the world, ITER, a research lab in Germany and I am now a research fellow in nuclear fusion at the University of Manchester! I love anything related to potential materials or engineering for future fusion reactors!
Fission v Fusion, nuclear’s role in conversion to a hydrogen economy, how nuclear power fits with our future energy mix, it is all important and all exciting!
Joining me is Emre Yildirim, a PhD Student here at the university to give a different perspective into the world of fusion but also on life as a PhD student, how COVID has affected research and what it is like being a young researcher in the fusion community.
Fusion is always seen as 50 years in the future, but could now be a turning point in this exciting area of research? AMA!

EDIT - Wow - thank you all for the questions. We're going to be heading back to our day job as researchers now. We'll try to pop back tomorrow to follow-up and answer some more questions.

[Crosspost] AMA on r/ThePharcydeOfficial I am Bootie Brown, founding member of The Pharcyde. Ask Me Anything!
**Join us for an AMA on Saturday Oct. 3rd @ 12 pm PDT over @** r/ThePharcydeOfficial 

&gt;Listening to “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde” two full decades after its release, its sense of timeliness is unmistakable. Every song on the album inverts a hoary hip-hop cliché. With classics like “Oh Shit,” “Otha Fish”, “Ya’ Mama,” and hit single, “Passing Me By,” it is not surprising that it shipped over a million units, garnered comparisons to De La Soul and Tribe Called Quest, and everyone from Pitchfork Media to The Source has hailed it as one of the greatest albums ever made.  
&gt;  
&gt;Speaking on the passage of time, their second release “LabCabInCalifornia” has revealed exactly how far-reaching The Pharcyde’s vision was. From enlisting a young and then unknown James Yancey aka J DILLA to produce beats, the classic “Runnin” to collaborating with director Spike Jonze (“Being John Malkovich” “Adaptation”) on the video for “Drop,” it has consistently reinforced their steadfast refusal to tread familiar artistic grounds.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In 2005, Bootie Brown was featured as a vocalist on the Gorillaz's "Demon Days" album on the song "Dirty Harry". 

Thread opens for questions an hour before at 11 am PDT.

I am a photographer who shoots nude couples and singles AMA
Hi Reddit,

**EDIT: In few hours i am going to have a photoshoot again, so if admins lift the block, i will answer all questions delayed, keep them gladly coming!**

**Thank you for so many and nice questions!**

# EDIT: thank you very much! I am back online and answering if somebody still cares. Love you till the end of the universe!

one of my life-time hobby as a nudist and photographer is to shoot amateur couples, often nude and often also during their "private time". It all evolved from pre-wedding art / erotic books from bride to groom, through "the better wedding night" sessions and now even finding my self booked often even by older couples.

Thought it might be an interesting AMA ( outrageous suddenly seems normal ) as most my customers won't talk about the experience publicly. I am from Germany but have had bookings around the EU, especially in France, Switzerland, Spain and many holiday resorts.

Not sure what level of proof i should give to not look like i am advertising, so hope this will do.

[X-Post] AskHistorians 2020 Conference Panel: Power and Projections of Trauma in the 19th and 20th Centuries Panel Q&amp;A
AskHistorians is hosting its first ever online digital conference this week! We have a whole slate of exciting talks and accompanying AMAs with the panelists.

Last up for today is [Power and Projections of Trauma in the 19th and 20th Centuries Panel Q&amp;A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVLNFeM89Kw)

This panel explores how power is performed through the creation and distribution of propaganda, and the ways in which this propaganda is used to express the traumatic experiences of others.

#[Click through here for the AMA with the panelists](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iu2g11/power_and_projections_of_trauma_in_the_19th_and/)

&gt; Moderated by **Lisa Baer-Tsarfati** (/u/historiagrephour), it explores the marginalization of Indigenous Americans, British and Chinese women, and Chinese youth.
&gt; 
&gt; It features:
&gt; 
&gt; **Adam Franti** (/u/PartyMoses), presenting his paper, **“His Gallant Soul Had Fled: Death, Remembrance, and Race in Early America”**.
&gt; 
&gt; *Reporting the death of generals and admirals in the wars of the long 18th century followed particular patterns and were written for political purposes. Generals lying slain on the field were venerated, celebrated, represented as central to victory or nobility in defeat. Reports, from military dispatches to newspaper accounts, imitated stylistic components from earlier deaths, creating a self-referential genre of death. The pattern changes markedly when applied to the deaths of Native leaders. While similar in style and veneration, the death of Native leaders initiated long-term squabbles over the identity of the man or men responsible, and served as a way to turn the Native struggle into one that reflects white values over Native.*
&gt; 
&gt; *This paper contrasts the death reports of prominent white leaders such as James Wolfe, Isaac Brock, and Edward Pakenham with those of prominent native leaders such as Metacomet and Tecumseh, and explores the racial dimensions of military propaganda.*
&gt; 
&gt; **Katie Truax** (/u/historyfrombelow), presenting her paper, **“Dealing with Catastrophe: Medical Men and the Diseases of Women in 19th-Century Britain”**.
&gt; 
&gt; *This paper discusses descriptions of catastrophe in women’s bodies in the medical field in 19th-century Britain. In the first half of the century, before medical school and the medical field were codified and institutionalized, medical men struggled to deal with the diseases of women. Handling gynaecological issues was complicated by the limits of propriety in patient interactions and the limited knowledge of women’s bodies and diseases. Furthermore, the field was often cutthroat and difficult to earn a living in, leading to a continuous effort to create a narrative about women’s bodies and diseases that removed culpability from physicians, protected their reputations, and justified experimentation. This historical moment sheds light on the conflict that can arise between medical professionals, their patients, and their public perception when catastrophic medical events occur. The diseases became “incurable,” the women were blameworthy, and the uncertainty and fatality created long-term effects in the field of gynaecology.*
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Stephanie Montgomery** (/u/dr_smm), presenting her paper, **“‘A Den of Monsters’: Women, Crime, and the City in 1930s China”**.
&gt; 
&gt; *Emerging out of the chaos of revolution, the Republic of China founded in 1911 faced a dizzying number of obstacles to consolidating power across the former Qing empire. By 1927, the Republican government had gained tenuous control over some eastern coastal cities, launching social, cultural, and political campaigns with mixed results. At the same time, writers in the popular press wrote prolifically on the pervasiveness of crime in Republican-held cities, with special attention to the problem of women’s crime.*
&gt; 
&gt; *This paper examines how popular writers in the 1920s and 1930s imagined women’s crime as an unfolding catastrophe in a rapidly changing society. Their conversation fit into a larger genre of heated debate during this period: the discussion of uneducated, illiterate, foot-bound Chinese women who were economically dependent on men, widely known as the “woman problem” debate. Likewise, in writing on women criminals, popular writers used sociological studies, criminology, and pseudoscience to argue for women's socioeconomic vulnerability, but also their biological predisposition to crime. Influenced by theories of social Darwinism, they concluded that women’s crime was a threat to the domestic sphere, the Chinese race, and to the very future of building a modern Chinese society.*
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Melissa Brzycki** (/u/mel_brzycki), presenting her paper, **“Young People in the Chinese Great Leap Forward and its Aftermath, 1958–1962”**.
&gt; 
&gt; *Nine years after the foundation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, state officials initiated the Great Leap Forward (1958–1961), an attempt to rapidly transform the country into a socialist, industrial powerhouse, using increased agricultural production to fund industrialization. The Great Leap Forward constituted a disruption to the lives of all Chinese people, not only because it necessitated the mobilization of all members of society, including children, but also because of the famine (1959-1961) that resulted from Great Leap Forward policies. This deadly famine caused widespread starvation and malnutrition, killing tens of millions of people.*
&gt; 
&gt; *There are relatively few sources that contain the voices and experiences of young people during this period. However, according to official records, the rate at which young people—some as young as 10 or 11 years old—were committing crimes in the late 1950s and early 1960s seems to have been increasing. State records make no connection between these crimes, which include theft and speaking out against state policies, and the Great Leap Forward and famine, but as historians, we can use these accounts to glean some insight into how young people may have reacted to this period of starvation and scarcity.*

I Am Michael Cannell, author of A Brotherhood Betrayed, a true story of the rise and fall of Murder, Inc. and the executioner-turned-informant whose mysterious death became a turning point in Mob history. Let's chat—ask me anything!
Hi Reddit,  


Michael Cannell here. My new book, A Brotherhood Betrayed, focuses on the brief moment before World War II erupted when America's attention was fixated on the streets of Brooklyn—the streets where Murder Incorporated held court. This is the story of the one man who attempted to take them down.  


I've also written books about The Mad Bomber of NYC (Incendiary), the 1961 Grand Prix Circuit (The Limit), and a biography of architect I.M. Pei. Once upon a time I was an editor at the New York Times and I've also written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and many other publications. I live in New York City.

I am John Bowe, a Toastmaster and the author of I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, and I’m here to talk about mastering the art of public speaking. AMA!
There’s a reason 74% of Americans suffer from speech anxiety and 95% of normal people hate public speaking. But it’s not what you think.

Public speaking isn’t painful because it’s an innately horrible thing to share your thoughts with fellow human beings and have them know you (in fact, it’s a pretty nice idea). It’s horrible because no one teaches us how to do it. But I learned how to do it by going through Toastmasters and then writing a book called I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY: Mastering the Art of Public Speaking in an Age of Disconnection.
Here’s more info about my book: https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-400-06210-2

I just started my first business at 22 yrs old, making interactive art prints/T-shirt which are scannable and let people hear the sound behind their product. Ask me anything about starting a business!
Hi r/IAMA !,

My name is Kiarash, nice to meet you all.

When I lost my grandmother, for the first time I realized the importance of voices and how we usually take them for granted, not knowing that one day we might not hear them ever again. I pondered on this question for a long time; how could I possibly come up with an idea to resolve this problem that many people might have. My solution was simple: what if I could preserve voices the way we preserve photographs. What if we could hang voices on a wall? Or print them on T-shirts?

That is when we started [www.soundwaveshop.com](http://www.soundwaveshop.com/) and asked people to upload their recordings on the platform. The website then, converts the audio files to visual images (the same way we can see heart beats on a monitor!)  and then users can order and we print them on T-shirts or canvases. On  each of these prints, there is a Qr code which you can scan to hear your recording. 

Anyways, I know there are many aspiring entrepreneurs outhere with amazing stories of turning their problems into business opportunities and I wanted to share mine. Ask me anything about how to start a business when you are young and have very little money! or anything about the idea!

My name is Ronn Cantu. I publicly protested the Iraq War as an active-duty soldier. Ask me anything about dissenting while on active duty and pushing the limits of free speech under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Hi y'all. My name is Ronn Cantu and I publicly spoke out against the Iraq War while on active duty with the United States Army. I was threatened with legal charges, received death threats, someone online even called me fat :'( 

At the time, they told us we were fighting for freedom but I thought that was a bald-faced lie. More than fifteen years later and law enforcement all over the country has proved it was. They told us that it was better to fight the terrorists "over there rather than over here" and now look where we are.

In 2006, I couldn't convince other soldiers that the rights I was flexing were their rights too.

This past week, an Army regional commander--a 4-star general--sent an email to everyone under his command an affirmation that soldiers do have the right to "participate in off-post demonstrations in the United States when they are off-duty, out of uniform, when their activities do not constitute a breach of law and order and when violence is not likely to result."

The general went on to specify "My general order prohibits social and recreational gatherings.  I do not view those who want to exercise their first amendment rights as engaged in a social or recreational gathering. "

This. Is. Huge. The general is tacitly giving all soldiers under his command permission to take to the streets in order to speak directly to their civilian leadership!

The general is obviously correct but his email didn't go far enough. In addition to having the right to participate in off-post demonstrations, active-duty servicemembers have the right to speak to media and voice their dissent provided they don't use slanderous language against anyone high up in their chain-of-command (anyone with stars on their uniform or "secretary" in their title and definitely not the Commander-in-Chief).

I will caveat this to mention that the Army picks and chooses the charges it brings forward. I did a radio interview with an active-duty soldier who absolutely called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney "liars" and I'm friends with an active-duty NCO who publicly spoke out against the war IN UNIFORM. Neither were punished.

In the interview I talk about in the below clip, I was not off-duty, nor out-of-uniform, nor off-post, and I wasn't punished. 

All of us were honorably discharged.

These are the times when heroes identify themselves and right now the country could use a hero if not a thousand.

Ask me anything! :)

The following list is not exhaustive. I talked to any journalist who would listen; LA Times, Houston Chronicle, BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). Those were probably some of the biggest outlets plus a myriad of smaller ones.

[60 Minutes - GIs Petition Congress to End Iraq War](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gis-petition-congress-to-end-iraq-war/) \- The one that got me and IMDB credit and body shamed. In the weeks leading up to my second deployment, I was eating all the fast food I knew I wouldn't be able to for the next year. I'm not sorry. Not even a little bit.

[Future of GI Resistance](https://youtu.be/FZ7jj7CPOkI) \- I wasn't scheduled to speak on this panel. I happened to be present when the original speaker threw a tantrum and quit. I was asked if I wanted to speak and said sure! I went before a live, international audience with nothing prepared. The story about my captain having to call me back into her office to rescind her order is 100% true.

When election time comes, voters are constantly being shoved into ideological boxes. I'm Blair Walsingham, an outside the box congressional candidate for Tennessee's 1st District. AMA!
I’ve heard every label used against Democrats and I’ve been called all sorts of things. DEMON-CRAT, DEMO-RAT, COMMIE. It’s fine. I have a thick skin.  What that says about the people leading the charge in these attacks is that they are scared! They are scared that voters might want to try something new. Labels keep voters in line. My policies are based on ideas that we’ve been trained to dismiss because if you believe, like I do, that each of us is worth more than we have been led to believe, then the balance of power will shift away from centralized bureaucracy and lessen the power of those who lead.

&amp;#x200B;

Labels tell voters to shut their eyes and close their ears.  Elections are becoming more about boxing us into a corner rather than an exercise in free thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I am **Blair Walsingham**. I am not Nancy, Chuck, Hillary, Bill, Barack or Bernie. If I had to pick a face to define what I stand for, it would be the face of any voter in the country who is seeking health, freedom and financial security.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part about this gang style political environment is that what it really means is that voters have given up. They have decided that the individual means so little that only the faces on tv matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not ready to give up, and I’m fighting to give voters hope. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."

&amp;#x200B;

Our leaders in Washington have paved a path of chaos, division and low standards for success. We can stay on that path, or we can forge a new one together.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’m Blair Walsingham, and I’m running for U.S. Congress in Tennessee’s 1st District. I will put people before politics because justice should be blind, but voters shouldn’t be. AMA!**

Edit 2: As we mentioned, Blair has to take care of her kids while doing this. She'll do her best to answer any previously asked questions, but will likely be finishing today with only those ones. She'll try to answer some new ones over the coming days.

**My short bio:** My name is John DeFeo. I graduated from NYU with a film degree and six figures of debt. Shortly thereafter, I fell into poverty. After taking a $400/per-week media job in 2004, I gradually worked my way up to an executive position at one of the largest online publishing companies.

In Sept. 2018, I quit my job because I didn't like the direction that the web (or for that matter, my own life) was taking. A month later, I launched a pet project called Good, Cheap and Fast that was a rejection of everything that I hated about corporate publishing. Today, the website has become by full time focus.

I want to thank you all again for the overwhelmingly positive response. I know tensions are high in this climate and hopefully you'll have gained some insight into what it was like to do this job - at least from my own experience.

I also want to thank anyone again who's sent good luck wishes for my book.

These are difficult days and it's been a heartwarming surprise to see comments from those who decided to place an order.

**UPDATE:** Alright everyone, there have been some fantastic questions asked and  I'm having a ball. I'm glad so many people were interested. Sadly I have to head out soon as we've went over the 3 hour mark.

I'll answer all the questions that haven't been answered yet, over the few hours or so. But I have to wrap this up now.

Thanks for the great questions, well wishes for the launch, and interest in my memoir. If you didn't get a chance to ask something you can always pop in to the livestream on the 7th to ask it. I might even come back and do another one of these in the weeks following.

P.S. to all the commenters asking about a Funny or Not-So-Serious crime squad, I think you've found your colleagues!

Hi Reddit,

I was born in the 50s in Glasgow and spent the early years of my police career across the Highlands and Isles of Scotland. 

In short order I joined the elite Serious Crime Squad, first as a murder detective, and ultimately an accomplished surveillance expert.  I’ve seen the limits of the law stretched and fire fighting with fire.  I’ve seen it all: armed fugitives, gangsters, paedophiles.

I still consult and train in the field today, as well as coaching a football team - albeit a walking one! 

I’m coming here to get a bit of practice in before the launch of my memoir, The Ten Percent, as it’s going to have an audience Q&amp;A element to it.  It’s a glimpse into the dark and dirty aspects of police work as well as a (hopefully) entertaining account of my life. It’s dedicated to my late daughter, Louise.

For proof, why not a bit of shameless self promotion! Here’s the link to my publisher’s site where you can pre-order the book, and the link to the launch’s Eventbrite page. It’s free, so why not join in if it strikes your fancy.

I've been a musician since I was a teenager and I'm about seventy now.  I started as a visual artist, but when I heard the Velvet Underground, I instantly wanted to create atmospheres in sound, so I took up the guitar.  I went on to start a band called The Modern Lovers when I was 19, and twenty-odd years ago, my drummer Tommy and I made music for the movie, "There's Something About Mary."

We are Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow. We have been friends for over a decade and also work together hosting a podcast. We wrote a book about how hard it is to keep your friends over the long haul. Ask Us Anything!
We have written a book called Big Friendship about the importance of friendship. It's an important bond and social institution that doesn't always get the robust conversation and attention it deserves. Friendship is life-affirming but it's also hard work. We are not not experts, just two people puzzling over how to stay close over the long term. We are excited to hear others talk about how they are doing friendship in their own lives.

I am Devin "Devlybon" Bontreger. I was born and raised Amish until the age of 16, and I have recently started my business selling supplements online to esports enthusiasts and professionals. AMA!
Several months ago I created my business to bring together my passions for health/fitness and esports. I love technology and I love the competitive nature of esports, mainly Rocket League, and I believe that healthier bodies lead to better players. 

In contrast to my current technological existence, I was born and raised in an Amish community. I am an only child with a single mother, and I left the Amish about 10 years ago. I still live in my hometown so I'm constantly surrounded by the culture and the people.

Ask questions about gaming, fitness, Loadout, or being Amish, I'll answer as much as I can!

Hi Reddit! Class Action Park’s filmmakers Seth Porges and Chris Scott here along with former Action Park employee Ed Youmans. Ask us anything!
A little bit about us:

Seth Porges: I co-directed and produced Class Action Park. I went to Action Park as a kid and have spent the past decade chasing my memories and trying to understand if the chaotic, anarchic, strange, dangerous, fun, terrifying, dangerous, violent place in my head could possibly have been real. Prior to Class Action Park, I worked with some friends in 2013 on a separate short documentary about Action Park ("The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever") and appeared in a few dozen episodes of Travel's "Mysteries at the Museum" telling fun stories from history. I'm also a journalist and former magazine editor. Ask me anything about Class Action Park, Action Park, theme parks, pinball... or anything else. And say hi on Twitter: @sethporges.

Chris Charles Scott: Hi all! I co-directed and produced Class Action Park. I had never heard of Action Park until my friend Seth told me about this strange and insane amusement park and I couldn't believe it was real. Turns out, it was—and I was instantly obsessed. Ask me anything about Action Park, Class Action Park, or college football and I'll answer from beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada. 

Ed Youmans: I’ve worked in ski area management most of my life, working in New Jersey, Lake Tahoe, Oregon, and Colorado. These days I’m the general manager of a ski resort in Western, NY. I worked at Action Park from 1985 to 1995. I began there as a Ride Attendant and spent the last 5 years there as the Resort Operations Manager. I was immediately interested in contributing to this film mostly because I saw Seth’s mashable.com video on Action Park in 2012 and thought he did a better job than anyone ever had at painting a picture of what Action Park was all about. When I heard he was doing a feature-length film I thought “he’s the right one to tell the whole story”. After 10 years at Action Park, I was more or less burned out and at least a little “post-traumatic” - so I moved to Lake Tahoe and spent a couple of years rock climbing in Yosemite to decompress.

I became the youngest person to walk across the Gobi Desert. AMA!
In 2011, I was approached by an explorer to join an expedition to walk 1000 miles across the Gobi Desert. I didn't even know where the Gobi Desert was - I just said yes. I spent six months training while finishing high school exams and then missed my graduation to go the very far west of Mongolia to begin the walk. I was 18 at the time.

We were supported by a local Kazakh support team and 14 camels. The team started with 12 but by the time we finished 2 months later, there were 4 of us who completed the entire walk on foot.

While on the expedition, I became close friends with some local nomads and ended up living with them for three months the following winter. I then flew out a nomad to come live with me in Hong Kong for a month. That was an incredible experience.

Since then, I've completed a number of expeditions around the world - where possible, to raise funds and awareness for causes close to me. I also go back to Mongolia every year or so to spend time with my nomadic friends as a kind of break from the world and technology.

I believe that expeditions that challenge us mentally and physically put colour in our everyday lives and it is an experience we should all go through.

AMA!

P.S. I write about life and expeditions [here](https://camelsmouth.me) and post interactive stories about them on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/founditlostit)

I’m a 16 y/o female with a life-long vascular disease and auto immune disorders.
I’m a 16 year old girl as of writing this, and 2019/2020 have not been my years as of yet. In late 2019 I was diagnosed with JIA (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and given anti-inflammatories to manage it. In January 2020 I was diagnosed with the flu, then in February I had strep throat, and in March I got mono and the flu again, only I also had large rashes on my legs/ankles and my eyes were bloodshot 24/7 (i wasn’t a stoner or on any drugs at the time) so I was hospitalized overnight after going to the emergency room about the rashes because they did extensive blood work and found out I had severe anemia and was borderline in kidney failure. Fast forward to the next day, I’m released from the hospital under the condition that we’ll do more testing with my doctors. About a week goes by (this is during the time I had the flu for the 2nd time) and I wake up from a long night of coughing with a large bump on my forehead as if I’d smacked my head on something, but there was no bruising and it was only getting bigger as the morning went on (it was in my hairline stretching to my eyebrow on the entire left side of my forehead) so we sent pictures to my rheumatologist and nephrologist and they contacted me and told me to go to children’s hospital immediately. I’m admitted, get a ct scan and mri of my head, and due to the rashes and testing to find out potentially what it is, a ct scan of my chest. They think I have gpa (granulomatosis with polyangiitis) but will need a kidney biopsy to confirm. But as I’m anemic, I need to get a blood transfusion before they feel safe performing the biopsy. I get the transfusion along with iv steroids for my head, and they determine I’ve recovered from the flu and my blood levels are high enough to perform the biopsy the next day. They perform the biopsy and confirm GPA, and proceed to do blood tests and tests on my lungs to ensure it’s only affecting my kidneys. They did five days of strong iv steroids to try and help my kidneys recover, and the night before I was released they gave me a dose of cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug) to knock out my immune system so it stops attacking my kidneys and joints. At this point they’ve taken me off my medication for arthritis because it’s hurting my kidneys, and I’m not allowed to take any NSAIDS because they’re bad for my kidneys as well. I was in the hospital for the second time a grand total of five days, and I was released with an order to continue doing cytoxan monthly for a total of 6 doses, as well as taking iron supplements and prescription steroids. So far I’ve done 3 out of 6 of my doses and I’ve got the 4th one scheduled. I’m down to 20mg of prednisone every morning (it was 60 when I was released) but the side effects caused me to have significant weight gain. This far into the treatment, I’ve experienced mild hair thinning, and nausea/vomiting the night and morning after the cytoxan. I have to be extremely careful about what I do and where I go especially now with covid-19, because I have a compromised immune system. It made life very difficult for me, but I’m finally starting to be able to see friends again. I’ve felt like an outcast but reading everyone else’s stories here has made me feel less like an anomaly or burden. This is my first time sharing my story on the or anywhere publicly really. Thank you so much to anyone who has bothered to read this far. Any questions or comments or advice you have, feel free to comment!

IAmA Face Transplant recipient 10 year update
[Verified Facbook](https://facebook.com/Mitch.W.Hunter)

Hello Reddit, it's nice to be back again to answer another round of awesome questions from you all. I have done 3 othet AmAs over the last 10 years and I figured its about time for another. 

To make a long story short, I was hit with a power line. It's a pretty shocking story that ends with me getting a full face transplant. 

I was a passenger in a pickup truck and the driver lost control around an S turn, hitting a utility pole. When the female passenger came in contact with one of the downed lines, I apparently tried and succeeded in saving her life, only to be hit with the same line. I was hit with 10,000 volts, 7 amps for 5 mins. The electricity entered my left leg, went through my body, and exited my face. I suffered a left below knee amputation, minor and major electrical blowouts throughout my body, in full thickness burns to the face.

I've had over 67 reconstruction surgeries on my face, multiple done on my body, and finally a full face transplant. Altogether I had over a hundred surgeries!

It's been 20 years since the accident and almost 10 years since the face transplant - ask me anything you want Reddit I'm an open book.

[/u/TheRussianFleet1863](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRussianFleet1863/)

&gt;High school, army, electrical apprentice, record room manager/undergrad, PRA in rheumatology, help desk/MPH, PRA/data manager, PRA/PhD, instructor, assistant professor... that takes us from 1983 until today. I did my undergrad work in biology and anthropology, then my MPH in International Health and Development .My PhD work was in COPD so I call myself a thoracic epidemiologist or something like that. I'm in the academic research track so I'm 95% funded by grants, NIH or whomever will give them to me and my collaborators, 5% is from the department and it's used to pay for time spent on committees (school and dissertation), departmental business and other student interactions, I don't teach but I mentor.  
My interests are primarily diseases and exposures that manifest in the chest, lungs in particular just now but I've done a lot of work with the heart. My favorite exposure is cannabis which started out because a lot of people inhale it but that interest has spread beyond the lungs to look at DKA(t1d), sleep, sex, tertiary exposure to THC and a few other topics involving cannabis. My least favorite exposure is tobacco because it's so obviously bad and I hate to see well evolved organ systems like the lungs and heart failing due to smoking cigarettes. I've done a lot of research in COPD, especially in the interaction between COPD and type 2 diabetes and we completely redefined COPD as a disease but most people haven't noticed yet. My favorite unsolved epi mystery is; "why don't people with type 1 diabetes show progressive microvascular complication effecting the lungs/breathing?" My top three favorite books are; Sten (the series), The Vang and To Say Nothing of the Dog. I play banjo (poorly). I'm currently playing Graveyard Keeper and Assassin's Creed Odyssey and my Plex directory has 1,737 folders in it.

I am Matt Elmes, PhD; Cannabis scientist. After making discoveries about how we process cannabinoids at the cellular level, I transitioned to work in the California cannabis industry. I’ve also been a regular cannabis user myself for 20 years. Now that you’ve read my qualifications as Dr. Weed, AMA!
*TL;DR: Academic cannabis researcher who transitioned to work in the California cannabis industry. Here to announce our brand new nationally-distributed CBD brand [Care By Design Hemp](https://ama.carebydesignhemp.com) and answer all of your questions about cannabis, cannabinoids or working in the cannabis industry!*

---

Hi Reddit!  I am Dr. Matt Elmes, Cannabis scientist and cannabis enthusiast. I did my PhD in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Stony Brook University, where I studied how our bodies metabolize plant cannabinoids (such as THC &amp; CBD) and endocannabinoids (the compounds our bodies naturally produce which THC ‘mimics’ to exert its psychotropic effects). The work done by me and my group identified ways that cannabinoids are transported to their respective metabolic enzymes inside of our cells.  We first showed how this intracellular [THC transport step happens in the brain](https://www.jbc.org/content/290/14/8711.full.pdf), then later in grad school I went on to [extend these findings to how it works in the liver](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44108-3). Our livers serve as the main site of phytocannabinoid inactivation so it is an important tissue for how we experience the effects of THC.  

After grad school I accepted an industry-funded postdoc position with [Artelo Biosciences](https://artelobio.com) doing preclinical drug development on a novel class of drugs that are able to alter our endocannabinoid system (ECS) signaling. By using a drug compound to block the molecular transport step that leads to our endocannabinoids getting broken down, we are able to temporarily raise the levels of endocannabinoid signaling in the brain and nervous system, which results in potent anti-pain and anti-inflammatory effects. The overarching goal was to create a new class of non-addictive, pain-killing drugs to help combat the opioid epidemic…and the ECS-boosting drugs my team and I created show [remarkable efficacy in rodents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5999033/)! We’re only in the preclinical stages of drug development (and thus still quite far away from being considered as an FDA-approved drug), but I believe that ECS modulation strategies will prove to be a promising therapeutic avenue for many conditions that are suffered today. 

During my postdoctoral work, some guy I had never heard of named Dennis Hunter reached out to offer me an interview for a position at his cannabis company on the other side of the country. This happened 18 months ago and brings us to today. I now work as the Director of Product Development for [CannaCraft](https://cannacraft.com), located in northern California and one of the largest cannabis product manufacturers in the entire world!  We’re very vertically integrated here at CannaCraft; meaning that we do everything from sourcing and growing cannabis, to extracting the cannabis oil from these plants, to using that oil to manufacture hundreds of various product SKUs (*e.g.* vapes, tincture/droppers, infused edibles, mints, beverages and many others), to doing our own distribution (as well as third-party distribution) delivering to dispensaries state-wide through our wholly-owned distribution entity [KindHouse](https://www.kindhouse.com).  

If you are a cannabis user living in California then you are most likely already familiar with some of our brands:


•	[Care By Design](https://www.cbd.org): Care By Design is our CBD-focused, wellness brand. Founded in 2014 under the old medical cannabis regulations, it is the roots of what CannaCraft has become. 

•	[Absolute Xtracts](https://www.abx.org): ABX’s target audience is more the recreational cannabis consumer. High-THC products that are formulated using strain-specific cannabis-derived terpenes. 

•	[Satori Chocolates](https://www.satorichocolates.com): Our Satori brand is all about delicious infused chocolates and other edibles. We hired a culinary-trained pastry chef to make sure all of our edible confections taste fantastic. (and they really do!).

•	[The Farmer &amp; the Felon](https://www.farmerfelon.com): This is our cannabis flower brand, for those consumer’s who enjoy consuming cannabis the old-fashioned way.  The brand tells the interesting back-story behind CannaCraft’s co-founders Ned Fussel (the ‘Farmer’) and Dennis Hunter (the ‘Felon’). 

•	[Loud &amp; Clear](https://www.abx.org/loud-clear): Loud &amp; Clear is a sister brand to ABX which focuses on high potency and flavor vape cartridges by formulating with *live resin*.  

•	[HiFi Hops](https://hifihops.com): In a partnership with our friends down the road at [Lagunitas Brewing Company](https://lagunitas.com) we have created the best-selling cannabis beverage in California, which is the largest legal cannabis market in the world.  

**Want to see what goes on behind the scenes at CannaCraft?** Let me take you on a [virtual tour of our 30,000sq.ft. manufacturing facility located in Santa Rosa, California!]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1OYebywx2Q&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I'm here with you today for a few things!  

First, I am excited to announce that we have just launched a brand new hemp CBD company [Care By Design Hemp](https://ama.carebydesignhemp.com) so for the first time ever we are able to legally ship the products we make over state lines, directly to people’s doors, almost anywhere in the US! For those who don’t know, hemp is a type of cannabis plant that produces only tiny amounts of THC, but most hemp is still able to make lots of CBD. Hemp has become federally legal under the 2018 Farm Bill, and so unlike the other products we make, we are able to offer these hemp-derived CBD products outside of California.  This AMA intro is getting a bit long, so I’ll tell you all about what makes all our new hemp-derived CBD products cool and unique somewhere in a comment below. Though I do want to mention in this intro that we are giving out a hefty discount code to our [online CBD store](https://ama.carebydesignhemp.com) for all the Redditors taking part this AMA…enter promo code “**CBDAMA30**” for 30% off your entire purchase!  We’ll leave this discount code active on the Care By Design Hemp website for the next 2 weeks or so.  

Next, I can actually use YOUR help!  I am in the midst of recruiting **daily CBD users** to take part in a current [IRB-approved clinical study](https://validcare.com/press/leading-cbd-brands-collaborate-to-sponsor-observational-research-aimed-at-answering-fdas-safety-concerns/) investigating the liver safety of using CBD products. Care By Design Hemp pooled funding with ten other prominent hemp CBD companies to fund this $1.5M+ clinical study to directly address the hepatotoxicity concerns expressed by the FDA. 
We are recruiting from all over the country, and if you participate in our study we will send you a free 3-month supply of a Care by Design Hemp CBD product of your choice, and you also get a $100 VISA gift card upon completion of the study! Participants will monitor their daily CBD use on a phone app over 30 days, then will go to your nearest lab testing center (*e.g.* Quest Diagnostics) to provide a single blood draw. Your blood will be analyzed for various markers of liver function and your results will be fully accessible to you!  Some of the specific inclusion criteria for all study participants are that you can attest to 30 days of daily CBD use, and also have abstained from using any THC products in that time period. We only have around 100 spots left in the study, so if you’re a CBD user interested in helping to advance cannabinoid science and believe you might qualify, then take our online questionnaire [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cbd-hemp-study) to go through all inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign up!

Lastly, you have a leading cannabis expert on the line here...Ask Me Anything! I’ve contributed dozens of presentations, peer-reviewed publications, podcasts, interviews and articles about cannabis and cannabinoids. As a long-time Ent (hi r/trees!) and lurker of Reddit I’m excited to be doing this! There are some things that I may not be able to touch on in order to protect company IP, but otherwise I’m an open book. AMA!

Keidmil! My name is David J. Peterson, and I'm the language creator from HBO's Game of Thrones, Netflix's The Witcher, Freeform's Motherland: Fort Salem, the CW's The 100, Legendary's Dune, and others. AMA!
Hello again Reddit! I'm /u/dedalvs, and I've got several things going right now:

* The season premiere of the final season of *The 100* airs tonight on the CW at 8/7C. I created the Trigedasleng language spoken by the Grounders on *The 100*.
* The season finale of the first season of *Motherland: Fort Salem* airs tonight on Freeform at 9/8C. I co-created the Méníshè language spoken by the witches with language creator and linguistics professor Jessie Sams (/u/quothalinguist). The show was just picked up for a second season.
* Jessie and I started a YouTube series called [LangTime Studio](http://langtimestudio.com) in which we create a language live on the stream step-by-step in two hour chunks. The thirteenth episode airs tomorrow at 2 p.m. PDT.
* I've got a book coming out on June 30th entitled [Create Your Own Secret Language: Invent Codes, Ciphers, Hidden Messages, and More—A Beginner's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Create-Your-Own-Secret-Language/dp/125022232X) from Odd Dot.
* I've created a Wiktionary-inspired dictionary for all of my languages which has enough critical mass to release. You can find it here: [http://wiki.languageinvention.com/](http://wiki.languageinvention.com/)
* I've also uploaded almost everything I did while working on *Game of Thrones* for ten years to my work space. You can find it here: [http://dedalvs.com/work/game-of-thrones/](http://dedalvs.com/work/game-of-thrones/)
* I've put up almost all the dialogue I've done on the shows I've worked on in a more digestible format on AO3: [https://archiveofourown.org/users/Dedalvs/](https://archiveofourown.org/users/Dedalvs/)
* More than that, I've also recently lost my four years of premium due to switching from the Alien Blue app, and I am already tired of the ads. This is a desperate ploy to get some gold so I can be rid of the ads for a little while longer. How do you live without it?!?

Other than those projects already mentioned, I've worked as a language creator on Syfy's *Defiance*, the CW's *Star-Crossed*, Syfy's *Dominion*, Marvel's *Thor: The Dark World*, Legendary's *Warcraft*, Showtime's *Penny Dreadful*, MTV's/Spike's *The Shannara Chronicles*, Marvel's *Doctor Strange*, NBC's *Emerald City*, AMC's *Into the Badlands*, Netflix's *Bright*, Netflix's *Another Life*, Netflix's *The Christmas Chronicles*, Netflix's *The Witcher*, Legendary's *Dune*, Netflix's *Shadow and Bone* (the latter with Christian Thalmann), and a video game called *Arena of Valor* from Tencent. I'm presently working on the second season of *The Witcher*, perhaps the tail end of *Shadow and Bone*, and six projects I can't yet disclose.

Feel free to AMA, but I won't be able to answer anything that's NDA or spoilery. I'll come back to answer questions about 1.5 hours from now (around 1:45 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time).

**UPDATE**: Okay, I have to go outside and run around with my daughter! Thank you for all the questions! If there are more, I'll answer them later tonight, so feel free to keep asking stuff. Stay grammar! &lt;3 6:07 p.m. PDT

We are DBT therapists and co-hosts of Therapists in the Wild, a DBT skills podcast. AMA!
*Edit: We're popping back in to answer a few more questions and plan to do another AMA soon where we'll devote more time to answering the questions we couldn't get to today.* 

We are two best friends in the final year of our clinical psychology doctoral program, in which we were trained and supervised by a student of Marsha Linehan, the founder of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). We have devoted our clinical lives to applying DBT to a wide range of problems, including Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, anxiety, trauma, etc. Through our clinical work and research, we've learned about the many barriers to accessing this effective treatment, and have become passionate about broadly disseminating DBT skills to anyone who could benefit from them, as well as to therapists who do not have access to comprehensive DBT training. This realization led us to develop a DBT skills podcast called [Therapists in the Wild](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/therapists-in-the-wild/id1515633537), focused on teaching DBT skills in a fun and engaging way. Because we believe in leveling the playing field between therapist and client, each episode includes examples from our own lives, to model how these skills can be applied to a wide variety of problems.

Here is some proof that we are, in fact, the Therapists in the Wild:

3. [Photo of us](https://imgur.com/a/Hbggw2v)

AMA!

EDIT: We so appreciate your questions, and **we cannot answer personal questions related to individual problems or concerns**. We are happy to answer questions about DBT in general, our podcast, etc. It would be unethical for us to weigh in on these personal concerns as we are not your therapists. Thank you!

Edit: Due to the overwhelming response to this AMA, we will not be able to respond to any questions asked after 12:15pm EST on 7/19/2020. Please check out our podcast for more info on DBT and how to apply the skills to your own lives. Thank you all so much for your interest and engagement! :)

_______________________________________________
Hi everyone, my name is Alton Edmond. Ask me any and all questions you've been dying to ask me. I will be answering your burning questions live tomorrow, Wednesday, September 16th from 12 pm to 2 pm EST.

As a criminal defense lawyer, I am professionally bound to be a duty expert on the lines between permissive and unconstitutional actions by law enforcement officers.  I know how to hold meetings, read people, manage budgets, advocate and most importantly -- listen to and trust the true experts on staff.  I see my role as Sheriff as a servant leader; own (and correct) all mistakes within the organization and delegate all credit where credit is due.  I also see this position as wholly apolitical.  I don’t serve any party agenda.   I don’t heed private interests or trade favors or play pressure politics.  I will serve my community’s best interests and support law enforcement’s mission to protect and serve.  I will take my oath seriously.

I am an employee of an American summer camp that successfully operated and completed our summer programs with zero cases of COVID-19. Ask me anything.
I have been working at summer camp for five years but this was my first year during a pandemic. I was hesitant to go back to camp at first but because of very rigorous testing, strict safety protocols, and an immense amount of planning, we managed to open and complete our summer camp in rural Michigan for over 400 children with a team of 200 staff. For over six weeks we worked tirelessly together to create a bubble and make sure everyone was safe and happy. Two days ago we completed our summer having had zero cases of COVID-19 at camp.

Ask me about how we pulled it off, what life was like running camp during a pandemic, what working at summer camps is like in general, or really anything you'd like.

[X-Post AskHistorians] AMA with Martha S. Jones, author of “Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All"
#[Link to the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iq3rsg/ama_martha_s_jones_author_of_vanguard_how_black/)

&gt; Hi, I’m [Martha S. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_S._Jones), author of *Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All*. I am a professor of history at [Johns Hopkins University](https://history.jhu.edu/directory/martha-jones/), where I teach courses on race and the law, Black womanhood, and the history of women and the vote.
&gt; 
&gt; *Vanguard* argues that Black women have been the vanguards of democracy – since the earliest days of the republic in movements for women’s rights and abolitionism. While many women celebrated the centennial of the 19th Amendment, I [wrote](https://forward.com/culture/452816/19th-amendment-centennial-not-celebratory-martha-jones/) about the disappointments of the 19th Amendment and how Black women were left behind to fight for several more decades against the disenfranchisement of Jim Crow laws. In my story, the 19th Amendment was a beginning, not an end, for Black women. In the 20th century, the women of *Vanguard*, including Fannie Lou Hamer and Shirley Chisholm, continued the work of voting rights into the civil rights movement and beyond. Today, leaders like Stacey Abrams and Kamala Harris carry this torch, and by their examples, make the case that neither racism not sexism has a place in American politics.

&gt; Hello,

&gt; We’re thrilled to discuss our new series, which started as a deep dive into the murders of women in Juárez, but led to a much greater discussion about cross-border relations, the impact of American consumerism, and the ongoing systemic issues facing people on both sides of the border.

&gt; The podcast: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-forgotten-the-women-of-ju-63028149/

&gt; Here’s a little background on us:

&gt; Oz (/u/owo867): I’m the co-host of "Forgotten." I also created and co-host the "Sleepwalkers" podcast, which explores the impact of AI on our daily lives. The connection between the two is my fascination with large-scale, man-made systems, from borders to artificial intelligence, and how they profoundly affect people’s lives. I’m thrilled to be here.

&gt; Mónica (/u/sgrey2020): I’m a freelance radio reporter. I’ve covered everything from drug violence and Mexican judicial reform to factory worker strikes and border enforcement policies. As an El Paso local and the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, the story of the Juárez murders is very personally for me. I have been reporting on them for over a decade and this project is very close to my heart.

&gt; We hope this podcast tackles a question that’s much bigger than who killed the young women: why is this still happening and how do we stop it?

&gt; Thanks for joining us - and please, ask us anything!

I’m Dr. Jud, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Brown University. I have over 20 years of experience with mindfulness training, and I’m passionate about helping people treat addictions, form new habits and make deep, permanent change in their lives.
In my outpatient clinic, I’ve helped hundreds of patients overcome unhealthy habits from smoking to stress eating and overeating to anxiety. My lab has studied the effects of digital therapeutics (a fancy term for app-based training) and found app-based mindfulness training can help people stop overeating, anxiety (e.g. we just published a study that found a 57% reduction in anxiety in anxious physicians with an app called Unwinding Anxiety), and even quiet brain networks that get activated with craving and worry. 
 
I’ve published numerous peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, trained US Olympic athletes and coaches, foreign government ministers and corporate leaders. My work has been featured on [60 Minutes](https://drjud.com/dr-jud-on-60-minutes/), [TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/judson_brewer_a_simple_way_to_break_a_bad_habit?language=en), [Time magazine](https://time.com/5556120/what-is-meditation/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/well/mind/a-brain-hack-to-break-the-coronavirus-anxiety-cycle.html), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/08/22/the-science-of-spirituality-a-psychologist-and-a-neuroscientist-explain-being-in-the-flow/#55caa16e4e0b), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/health/mindful-eating-lose-weight-hospital-profile/index.html), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483123383/can-mindfulness-help-you-quit-smoking), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/thecure/2016/06/breaking-bad-habits-mindful-addiction-recovery-160606134715200.html), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2018/02/26/nothing-worked-for-my-depression-until-i-tried-meditation/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-06-07/promoting-mindfulness-in-the-workplace-video) and recently, I [talked to NPR’s Life Kit](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/10/832171895/coronavirus-panic-how-to-get-your-thinking-brain-back-online) about managing anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
I’ve been posting short daily videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi6bQu-Df7Wh2x3gFT5a8aw) (DrJud) to help people work with all of the fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and even how not to get addicted to checking your news feed.

I became became one of the first-ever Foreign Porters (commonly known as Sherpas) to aid a Mt. Everest expedition. And this is what it did to me...AmA
For 23 days I didn’t shower, slept on the floor, ate a restricted diet, lost over 20 pounds and carried 100 kilos as an effort to become one of the first ever Foreign Porters to aid a Mt. Everest Expedition.

Footage Here: [http://theporterfilm.com/](http://theporterfilm.com/)

The project was a bit of a capstone to anotherwise out-of-my-mind five-year millennial stint to tackle the craziest adventures on the planet: from living in a Brazilian Favela with a family I met on the street to swearing to noble silence in a Himalaya Temple, I eventually got so manic that I raised enough money — because I had no money of my own — to film one of these immersive projects. And this is what came about.

*The Porter* began as a test of will. An effort to see just how far I could push myself before collapsing. And to do so, with obviously the hardest job on the planet. But then I actually did it. I actually slept on the ground, ate only rice, carried 100 kilos and completed an expedition only to cry in a closet afterwards, crawl into a bed and reflect on the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of other porters that have done, are doing and will do more than what I did, 20x a year. And that most of them are so underapaid that they can't even do anything else.

So, it definitely changed me in a pretty extreme way. But not at first. It took me a few months just to realize that, I, a random traveler, now had the only real proof of this injustice. And so, I tried to make a film.

I sit here today at my computer with a couple of empty pasta bowls beside me in a room that I've rented out from 2-weeks to 2 weeks, posting an AMA to Reddit with the hope that others might want to share this story and spread awarenes for the Porter plight too. I am not a filmmaker. I am not a marketer. I am just a "me" with an experience. And a mesage I think should be shared.

Hopefully this film can help raise some awareness for the improvement of Porters’ salaries on Everest.

Feel free to ask me anything. And don’t hold back.

In 2008, we skateboarded and biked from Chicago to New York City without an iPhone and made a film about it 13 years later. I am Arthur Swidzinski, the Director of the film, Shred America...Ask me anything!
Hi, in 2008 when I was 20 and superiorly stupid, I hopped on a skateboard with my best pal Mike Kosciesza along side two other good friends on bikes as our support and camera crew. 36 agonizing days later, our trip was finished. 

When you're done watching Shred America, you will know exactly how NOT to skateboard across the country, because we fucked up all along the way. 

The journey was half the battle, as it took us 13 years to release the film with Gravitas Ventures after a failed festival run. The trailer should fill in some blanks.

Mike will also be answering questions here. He was the producer, editor and skateboarder in the film. His answers will be signed -M

Yeah smart phones are a total crutch. Nowadays, if I need to know something I just Google it and find out instantly, back then you were kind of shit out of luck. You had to just wing it which made the trip way more interesting and caused us to fuck up way more than we would have liked haha.

If I didn’t know how to do something I would just call my dad.

[Crosspost] Hi! I’m Michael Shikashio CDBC, a dog trainer and behavior consultant who focuses exclusively on helping dogs with aggression issues. AMA!
[Michael will be answering questions here at /r/Dogtraining](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/gwr8io/hi_im_michael_shikashio_cdbc_a_dog_trainer_and/)

_______________


My passion is to help pet owners and pet pros understand, manage, and modify aggressive behaviors in dogs and my journey over the last two decades in dog training has included working with thousands of clients around the world, serving as past president of the [IAABC](https://m.iaabc.org/) (International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants), and creating educational content about working with aggression cases. My website is [here](https://aggressivedog.com/) and you can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michaelshikashio/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.shikashio) if you want to get notified of the projects I'm involved in.

I have been fortunate to travel all over the globe for the last five years (well, up until the pandemic!) teaching and learning from other dog behavior professionals in more than 100 cities in eight different countries. The journey has been fascinating as I have enjoyed observing the regional differences in dog behavior, and also the culture of dog training in each location, and how they work with aggression cases. One thing that everyone I have met has in common is that we all want to help dogs!

So let’s jump into the topic of aggression in dogs. AMA!

IamA freelance academic writer. I write essays/papers for people taking online classes (Nursing, Education, Business, etc.) AMA.
I wanted to do this AMA for a long time, but I was nervous about how people would react. 

I'm a freelance academic writer.  I write papers/essays full-time &amp; I've been doing it for years.  

*Does that mean she writes papers for OTHER people?*  Yes, that's what it means. Most of the work I do is for Nursing, Business Administration, or Education. 

IMO, it's okay for a busy person to hire someone to help with an online class.  But I definitely understand why some people say it's unethical.  

1. **"No, it's not okay to offer academic writing service."** A large proportion of reddit users are college-educated so they might take offense to the idea of hiring someone to write papers. 
2. **"Yes, it's okay offer academic writing service."** Reddit users are also shrewd and disillusioned, and they probably know higher education was corrupted already by profiteering, crazy high tuition, and crony-ism, so if you agree with that you might say you do not think it's unethical to hire an academic writer.   

When the school puts classes online, the student is more likely to hire an academic writer. The whole point of putting classes online was for the schools to save money and for corporate america to enable the rat racers to stay productive while they complete degrees.   

People in the fields of nursing or education find themselves working overtime AND they are expected to continue their education.  Same thing with a lot of people who get promoted to a management position and the company sends them to complete their business administration degree - there's not enough time.  

It's \*possible\* to do it without an online class assistant, but not if you want to get enough sleep, be available for family, perform well at work, etc.  

I  feel kind of guilty about how easy things are for me right now as an academic writer. The online class assistant industry is in high  demand.  And now we get more orders than ever because the pandemic caused more classes to be put online. I'm  also fortunate because as a freelance academic writer I can stay in my apartment where it's safe, &amp; I  keep making money.  

AMA!   It's okay if you want to say freelance academic writers are terrible for doing other people's research for them. I used to say the same thing.

I Am A 94 year old man. Back for AMA # 6.
 So it's probably my last. Yet, who knows? And I feel a lot wiser, in part, because I learned from thousands of young people around the world in my previous four efforts [(here is my previous AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8uw91h/iama_92_year_old_former_educator_with_4_amas/). Perhaps it's because of age and the claustrophobic condition of the pandemic I ponder more than I ever have before the condition of the world I am leaving for the next generation, a generation I have committed my life to professionally and personally.On the surface I have reason for despair! I've endured depressions, wars, horrors of commission and oppression. Yet I've also taken heart by the progress I have seen in my lifetime. The arc of progress spoken of by King in the fields of race and sexual orientation have far exceeded anything I might have anticipated.However: the last three years have shaken my confidence. Trump's vitriolic leadership has brought to the surface a flood of festering wounds. A nation that could previously be united in the face of adversity has become further divided.But thankfully my optimism has been rekindled. **I truly believe that King's Justice Arc was fueled by the optimism of youth coupled with the wisdom of those who have endured suffering and the vicissitude of aging.** As a part of that, I have countenanced gradualism as I pointed to the progress in my lifetime from the Jim Crow, homophobic society I thought would never change.I ADMIT I WAS WRONG. **NOW** *IS THE TIME TO MAKE LONG OVER-DUE CHANGES, IMMEDIATELY, TO REALIZE THE PROMISE SPOKEN OF FOR ALL BY OUR FOUNDERS.*In acknowledging the leadership of youth, I feel compelled to share the insights I have gained from my experiences coupled with the wisdom I have gained recently from weekly meetings for three years from sage retirees.Can it really be true that we privileged whites have FINALLY seen the suffering that we have wrought on “the other?” However I still look to the future with some trepidation. NEVER have I seen such polarization. The past three years have disclosed hatred and vitriol with little success in moving toward a common acceptance of the lofty statements of our founding creeds. While we have FINALLY come  to realize the staggering discrepancy in wealth in our society, SELF-CENTEREDNESS and human greed seem to prohibit us from pursuing reasonable solutions.My fear for the future is finding that common source of strength to permit us to work together toward the goals that were so lofty expanded when our nation was founded. What led us to boast of *American exceptionalism* and creating *Shining cities on a hill*?George **Santayana's quote: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”** comes to my mind as I ponder the exciting future that the present protests promise. And I marvel that it seems to have been nourished and sustained by young people.So, I truly look forward to conversations with more of you, and I invite you to Ask Me Anything.Proof: [https://imgur.com/xiScZ8G](https://imgur.com/xiScZ8G)📷**ReplyForward**

In the beginning I had to re-learn how to walk and for years, had severe short-term memory loss, but found that I could remember everything if I sang it or put it to a rhythm. I used music to learn everything in school, at a time when neurologic music therapy was an understudied topic. I ended up overcoming this brain injury and doing well in school. Brains are amazing. Now I work as a singer and a songwriter, using the same tools that helped me learn everything: math formulas, locker combinations, addresses and more, through music.

I'm Nina Renata Aron and I just wrote a memoir about addiction, codependency, and love. AMA!
I'm a writer and editor. My debut, Good Morning, Destroyer of Men's Souls: A Memoir of Women, Addiction, and Love, is out now from Crown. In it, I trace the history of codependency back to the temperance movement and tell my own story of obsessive love. I'm the editorial director of the new Playgirl magazine, which is relaunching this year in its original 70s spirit. And I'm a grateful member of AA and Al-Anon. You can find me on Twitter (@black_metallic) and Instagram (@ninarenataaron). You can read more of my writing on [my website](https://www.ninarenataaron.com/) and learn more about my book at: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/586540/good-morning-destroyer-of-mens-souls-by-nina-renata-aron/.

We're public radio reporters covering the Breonna Taylor case and protests for racial justice in Louisville, Kentucky. We're WFPL reporters Amina Elahi and Ryan Van Velzer. Ask us anything.
*** Thanks for all the thoughtful questions, y'all. You can keep up with what's happening in the case by going to our website, www.wfpl.org, and following us on Twitter: @WFPLNews, @aminamania and @RyanVanVelzer. ***

Louisville, Ky. has become an epicenter of racial justice demonstrations after the police killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed in her home by Louisville Metro Police officers in March. The investigation is still ongoing, as are the protests in downtown Louisville, but there is still inaccurate information circulating about the case. Amina Elahi covers city government, and Ryan Van Velzer has been on the ground with protesters. Ask us anything.

I am the writer/director of the indie film, ONLY, currently the #3 Movie on Netflix US - starring Freida Pinto and Leslie Odom Jr. Ask me anything!
Hey everyone! I'm Takashi Doscher and I am the writer/director of the small indie film, ONLY, which has miraculously climbed the Netflix charts this past week, hitting #2 on Friday! 

The film stars Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and Leslie Odom Jr., (Hamilton, Central Park). They play a couple trying to survive a pandemic that affects only women. (weird timing, I know). 

I wrote the first draft of the script 8 years ago, and it has been quite the journey to get the movie made, sold, and streaming on Netflix. Made completely independently, we premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in 2019 before eventually selling to a distributor called Vertical Entertainment. We had a limited theatrical release in March, which was basically shut down by the pandemic. Fast forward a few months, the movie releases on Netflix and (to my total shock) has been in the Netflix top ten since it's release. 

If you are a US Netflix subscriber, you can now watch the film here: https://www.netflix.com/title/80206413

Happy to answer any questions you may have about the film itself, the journey of being an indie filmmaker, or anything else! Cant wait to read your questions!

They gave me a lot of free drinks and food, invited me to their homes, gave me many gifts and even money!
* In 1 day I normally walked 25 - 35 kilometers. My daily record was 64 kilometers or 39 miles. I was going very slowly and I did not want to break any records.
* The weight of my bag varied a lot from from total 8 kg to 23 kilograms.
* For many weeks I was walking and camping in the [snowy mountains](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPOZyZ4Et4CYSZ_A_kXHx1Fuxk-BJ5EfLE1oZ8TkPKQSGOEoqKvjqoRcAe9Ikr_jg?key=NWp0bzFMUFljbEJFY2xHUk0tMkpYaVV0Uk9RLUhn) of Turkey with even -17 degrees celsius or / 1.4 °Fahrenheit.
* And for many weeks I passed some desert areas in Iran and in India where the temperature rose every day to +40 to + 42 degrees celcius or 107.6 °Fahrenheit.
* For many months I walked in the monsoon rains of Asia. In [Cambodia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2A9zUv8YIk) I once walked quite a long distance on a very remote road with the water over my knees.
* Once I crossed alone a hilly jungle in Laos where on day 3 I finished all my food and I started to [eat fresh bamboo leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qedWaKZsVnU).

* Over 1 week my walking was escorted by heavily armed [police forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukHtcSxd2YY) of Northeast India and in Myanmar.
* In different countries I was invited to visit over 45 [schools and universities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPAEHnLoPa8&amp;list=PLkuLFY8TBG04SIXcJ20X4T4vpmO9wLVG9) to share my travel experiences and photos with ten of thousands of students.
* For 1 month I lived [a zen monastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IerYuX9_54) in the mountains of Vietnam.
* My dear mother came to meet me and to travel together with we in Greece, Turkey, Nepal and in Vietnam. In Vietnam we had [an epic trip together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQzOxmyl5g) where we bought one bicycle, my mother was riding the bicycle with our bags and I was running (not walking) near her for over 220 kilometers in 2 weeks.
* Together with my older sister Kadi we went to conquer the highest mountain in Greece - [Mount Olympos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mojRBSBnd4M)
* I was [learning taekwondo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IECDLsyJ-Y) with a 5th Den Black Belt Master while living the master's home.
* Many people joined my walk in different countries. The biggest group I had in Vietnam where 13 people joined the long walk for 5 days. [Amazing group walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0rJUoFQMM8)!
* I found new homes to [3 dogs and 4 cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qJI8EXt9U) that I found abandoned in very remote roadsides. The longest time one dog walked with me was exactly 10 days.
* And I gave over 140 international [media interviews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_5a3_trHA&amp;list=PLkuLFY8TBG07n5dLv4A4kmAExFrgDcj6_) My biggest interview was a long TV interview for [**'Talk Vietnam'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_5a3_trHA)**.**
* After I had walked 13,000 kilometers I had arrived to [Vietnam](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNcHS1PHowUvwOSryrW8UyZJXFD4t7qwO1YRsEvDaDxNJjiWf3xCBREBdwdjrgjzg?key=WE9HcG9DYmhHdkJHc1lFeWpmYVl6OXIwbE1CeUV3) where I met a girl named Sâm. She was a marathon runner and wished to join my walk for few days. **In the next exactly 1 year Sâm came to meet me and to walk together with me exactly 10 times – 2 times by bus and 8 times by airplane in 5 different countries!** Together we walked over 750 kilometers. In October 2018 we got married and last year in March we became parents of [**a baby girl!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmOPvt4_KI&amp;list=PLkuLFY8TBG07ICc7JqrspcLkSZJ5rjh7C) We are dreaming and making plans to continue traveling around the world [**all 3 of us**.](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipONc1VYRk7a3ZObDIZUX1P3cOsDtJBYgBatVoTtW3gyYo6EMQX7ZrML0I5lhLkMhg?key=ajI5QWhPZmJORzZRZmFTbG9PVWZBTkd3VEo1WHln) Waiting for the global pandemic to end! I would continue walking and my wife and daughter would move on the same route with a small camping car.

Hey there,

I am currently a 20 year old student, no longer working there anymore. I worked there for a few years: 2017-2019. I mainly worked at a restaurant, but helped on the parking department, some rides, events and golf course.

I'm Justin Allen Co-founder of Hello TUSHY the modern bidet attachment AMA about bidets, bathrooms, and changing the world one clean booty at a time.
This toilet paper shortage has been a pain in the ass, right? That's why I'm here to answer all of your Q's about bidets and why they're a better alternative to wiping your butt with dry paper. I'm the co-founder of TUSHY: The modern bidet for people who poop.

[https://hellotushy.com/](https://hellotushy.com/)

Here's the clean deal: If a bird pooped on you, would you wipe it off with dry paper? No silly! You'd wash it off. So, why would you treat your butt any different? Not to be cliché like a cheesy 90's infomercial but TUSHY removes allllll the fecal matter with a precise, concentrated stream of H₂O rather than a dry smearin' wipe with TP.

Not only is TUSHY great for your bum, it's been a lifesaver (or ass-saver) during the TP shortage. You can cut down your TP use by 80% and a lot of our customers have been able to ditch it completely.

So now's your chance to ask me anything you ever wanted to know about bidets and booty washing magic.

Hi, r/IAmA! We’re the Savannah Morning News politics team. We covered the 2020 elections in Georgia, which for the first time since 1992 went blue in the presidential election. Ask us anything!
UPDATE: 3 p.m. It's been fun y'all, but I've gotta go do some work. Be good to each other!

We’re days removed from one of the most contentious elections in U.S. history and Democratic candidate Joe Biden was elected the 46th president of the U.S. Instrumental to Biden’s victory were wins in key battleground states that in 2016 voted for the Republican Party. One of those states was Georgia, a state that had not gone blue in the presidential elections since 1992 when Bill Clinton beat George H.W. Bush. The margin of victory in the Peach State was so slim that the state has said there will be a recount.The Savannah Morning News newspaper is one of the oldest newspapers in the state and its politics team has had a front row seat to everything that led to last week’s elections, including two senate races that are headed a runoff in January. Adam Van Brimmer is our Editorial Page Editor and host of our podcast The Commute and Will Pebble is our enterprise and politics reporter.

PARANORMAL ACTIVITY
 

1. Soon after World War II, Winston Churchill was visiting the White House when he is said to have had an uncanny experience. Having had a long bath with a Scotch and cigar, he reportedly walked into the adjoining bedroom – only to be met by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln. Unflappable, even while completely naked, Churchill apparently announced: “Good evening, Mr President. You seem to have me at a disadvantage.” [The spirit smiled and vanished](http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/10/ghost-stories-part-of-the-white-house%E2%80%99s-legacy/).

His supposed contact with the supernatural puts Churchill in illustrious company. Arthur Conan Doyle spoke to ghosts through mediums, while [**Alan Turing believed in telepathy**](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2012/07/20/brilliant-scientists-are-open-minded-about-paranormal-stuff-so-why-not-you/). Three men who were all known for their razor-sharp thinking, yet couldn’t stop themselves from believing in the impossible. You may well join them. According to recent surveys, as many as [**three quarters of Americans believe in the paranormal,**](http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/three-four-americans-believe-paranormal.aspx) in some form, while [**nearly one in five**](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/30/18-of-americans-say-theyve-seen-a-ghost/) claim to have actually seen a ghost.

Intrigued by these persistent beliefs, psychologists have started to look at why some of us can’t shake off old superstitions and folk-lore. Their findings may suggest some hidden virtues to believing in the paranormal. At the very least, it should cause you to question whether you hold more insidious beliefs about the world.

Some paranormal experiences are easily explainable, based on faulty activity in the brain. Reports of poltergeists invisibly moving objects seem to be consistent with damage to certain regions of the [**right hemisphere that are responsible for visual**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22229671) processing; certain forms of epilepsy, meanwhile, can cause the [**spooky feeling that a presence is stalking you close by** ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19448096/?i=1&amp;from=%22shadow%20person%22)– perhaps underlying accounts of faceless “[**shadow people**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_person)” lurking in the surroundings.

Story continues below

Out-of-body experiences, meanwhile, are now accepted neurological phenomena, while certain visual illusions could confound the healthy brain and create mythical beings. For example, one young Italian psychologist looked in the mirror one morning to find a [**grizzled old man staring back at him**](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24466-the-halloween-trick-that-conjures-ghosts-of-the-mind.html#.VFElDhD2fWY). His later experiments confirmed that the illusion is surprisingly common when you look at your reflection in the half light, perhaps because the brain struggles to construct the contours of your face, so it begins to try to fill in the missing information – even if that leads to the appearance of skulls, old hags or hideous animals.

So any combination of exhaustion, drugs, alcohol, and tricks of the light could contribute to single, isolated sightings, like that reported by Churchill. But what about the experiences of people like Conan Doyle, who seemed to see other-worldly actions on a day-to-day basis?

**Protective shield**

Psychologists studying religion have long suspected that a belief in the paranormal can be a kind of shield from the even harsher truths of the world. The idea is that when something unexpected happens – a death, natural disaster, or job loss – the brain scrambles around for answers, looking for meaning in the chaos. “It’s such an aversive state that if it can’t gain control objectively, we will get it by perceiving more structures around us, even if they don’t exist,” says Jennifer Whitson at the University of Texas, who studies pattern perception, and judgment and decision making. Even simply asking people to remember a time when they felt out of control, can [**make people see illusory forces at work**](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5898/115.full.pdf), she has found. That included seeing patterns in the random movements of the stock market, for example, but it could also manifest itself by linking two unconnected events, such as the belief that “knocking on wood” for good luck would improve your chances in a job interview.

Anthropomorphism is another common way that we try to understand events, says Adam Waytz at Northwestern University in Illinois. So we might think that a spirit lies behind a storm or that a demon is causing us to get ill – rather than acknowledging that we have no control over the matter; and if a branch is tapping on your window, you might be more inclined to imagine that it is a ghost sending you a message. “We create beliefs in ghosts, because we don’t like believing that the universe is random,” says Waytz. Again, this seems to be more common when we feel less control over our lives.

Given these strange turns of the mind, might some people be naturally inclined to see hidden patterns and motives, and could this explain why they are more superstitious than others? It is a question that Tapani Riekki at the University of Helsinki in Finland has tried to answer for the last few years. He says that believers often welcome his research, since they genuinely can’t understand why others don’t share their worldview. “They say that ’I don’t see why other people don’t feel what I feel, or believe what I believe’,” he says.

**Hidden faces**

Riekki recently asked sceptics and believers to view simple animations of moving shapes, while lying in a brain scanner. He found paranormal believers were more likely to see some kind of intention behind the movements – as if the shapes were playing a game of “tag”, say – and this was reflected in [**greater brain activity**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470919.2014.906366#.VFIbHhD2fEd) in the regions normally associated with “theory of mind” and understanding others’ motives. Riekki has also found that people who believe in the supernatural are more likely to see hidden faces in everyday photos – a finding confirmed by another team at the University of Amsterdam, who showed that paranormal believers are more likely to imagine that they had seen a [**walking figure in random light displays**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810013000974).

📷

*(Thinkstock)*

Added to this, Riekki has found [**that believers may have weaker cognitive “inhibition”**](http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=tr&amp;user=4IysLYEAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=4IysLYEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC), compared to sceptics. That’s the skill that allows you to quash unwanted thoughts, so perhaps we are all spooked by strange coincidences and patterns from time to time, but sceptics are better at pushing them aside. Riekki gives the example of someone who is thinking about their mother, only for her to call two minutes later. “Is it just that sceptics can laugh and say it is just coincidence, and then think of something else?” he wonders. Significantly, another paper reported that [**paranormal believers also tend to have greater confidence in their decisions**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810014000907), even when they are based on ambiguous information. So once they have latched onto the belief, you might be less likely to let it go. 

Even so, most researchers agree that sceptics shouldn’t be too critical of people who harbour these beliefs. After all, one study has found that various superstitions can boost your performance in a range of skills. In one trial, [**bringing their favourite lucky charm into a memory test significantly improved subjects’ recall**](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/05/27/0956797610372631), since it seemed to increase their confidence in their own abilities. Another experiment tested the subjects’ golf putting ability. Telling them that they were using a “lucky” ball meant they were more likely to score than those simply using any old ball. Even something as simple as saying “break a leg” or “I’ll keep my fingers for you” improved the participants’ motor dexterity and their ability to solve anagrams.

And even if you think you are immune, you shouldn’t underestimate the power of suggestion. Michael Nees at the Lafayette College in Pennsylvania recently asked a group of students to listen to sound recordings from US ghost-hunting shows. Subtly priming the volunteers with the thought that they were involved in a paranormal study increased the number of voices they reported hearing in the fuzzy recordings – despite the fact that they mostly reported being sceptics. It seems that the merest expectation of hearing something spooky can set your mind whirring.

Whitson’s research, meanwhile, shows how easy it is for us all to imagine strange happenings when we feel unsettled. Her latest experiment found that even priming someone with a feeling of hope – normally considered a positive emotion – can still increase people’s belief in the supernatural, or conspiracy theories. The reason, she says, is that hope is still full of uncertainty; it makes you question the future, compared to a feeling like anger where you might be surer of your righteousness.

And if you tell yourself that you have reasoned yourself out of superstitions and ghost stories, you might still harbour other beliefs that are equally fanciful, she says. It could be a full blown conspiracy theory about the government, or just suspicions that your colleagues are ganging up on you, based on a few spurious comments.

We can perhaps see the brain’s ability to “spot” illusory patterns in the response to the Ebola epidemic – such as the emergence of folk remedies (including the belief that drinking salt water is a cure), fears in the West that it will spread through air travel, and theories that [**it was created by industrialised governments**](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/upshot/fighting-ebola-and-the-conspiracy-theories.html?_r=0).

“It’s easy to think of yourself as the one holding the rational cards, but it’s wiser to understand that every one of us are going to be prone to those mistakes when we feel like we are lacking control,” says Whitson. “We should all be ready to evaluate our assumptions more thoughtfully.” As Churchill, Turing and Conan Doyle showed us, even the most astute minds can be given to fancy from time to time.

Hi we're the cast and crew of American Dreamers! We naively made an entire feature film out of an RV on a 100k budget across 3 countries and 50 locations and for some reason it actually worked! Our goal is to make filmmaking more accessible to anyone who has a great story to tell. Ask Us Anything
EDIT: Thanks for all the questions, we had a lot of fun! TBH, If you still have any questions feel free to ask, we'll just take longer to reply. :) 

Hi Reddit,

Any questions you have on guerrilla filmmaking or making a small budget look giant, ask us!

We have our cast and crew here and plenty of stories and opinions to share. We're firm believers that filmmaking today is transitioning to be more accessible, possible, and profitable, if done frugally with high quality production choices.

We just picture locked our first feature film 'American Dreamers' which we filmed over a short 22 days, in London (UK), Montreal, Kelowna (CAN), Yosemite, Las Vegas, Los Angeles (US), and More.

You can see the [trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJ-N0wAPfY&amp;) !
And here's a [short promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUKs3-UlQqI&amp;t=1s) for this AMA.

We may not be galvanized Hollywood moguls, but as young professionals we certainly learned a lot and we want to share our mistakes, strokes of genius, and the chaotic™ production that was the American Dreamers RV road trip.

[crosspost] Don Kulick, who has written a book about how a language dies in a Papua New Guinean rainforest, is doing an AMA in r/books!
#[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/igdtq3/im_don_kulick_who_has_written_a_book_about_how_a/)

AMA description: 

I am a linguistic anthropologist who has spent over thirty years traveling to a small village in Papua New Guinea documenting the death of an indigenous language called Tayap. When I first arrived in the village in 1985, Tayap was spoken by about ninety people. Today it is spoken by less than forty. My book, A Death in the Rainforest: how a language and a way of life came to an end in Papua New Guinea, is part memoir, part discussion of how a language dies and a culture atrophies, and part whodunit mystery. It describes what life is like in a rainforest – both for the people who live there, and for a visiting anthropologist – and it discusses how a group of people very far away from anything we might want to call “the West” think of white people and insist on being included in white worlds. I look forward to answering any questions you may have!

Our Newsvoice app was banned from Google Play Store for our unbiased Covid-19 coverage, a month later Google News releases the exact same feature. I’m Malin Cumzelius, COO, AMA!
A month ago, our [Newsvoice app](https://newsvoice.com/app/reddit2) was removed from Google Play Store, without warning, for our extensive Covid-19 coverage, which aggregated real-time statistics from very reputable sources such as ECDC. It took us almost a week to get through the opaque process of getting the app back up on the store, with the Covid-19 coverage removed. The official reason for removal was “profiting from disaster”.

Now, a month later, Google News has added the exact same features to their website. So how is it profiting from disaster when a small upcoming startup is doing it, but not when Google themselves do it?

Understanding the new dui laws in Florida - I am a criminal defense attorney answering questions about what to do with a DUI charge in Florida
**Biography:** Good afternoon Reddit! I am Florida criminal defense attorney Doug Leifert ([https://www.leifertlaw.com/our-firm/douglas-i-leifert-esq/](https://www.leifertlaw.com/our-firm/douglas-i-leifert-esq/)) at Leifert &amp; Leifert. As a former prosecutor and a current criminal defense lawyer, I have an abundance of knowledge and experience when it comes to our criminal justice system. This past year, Florida passed a law that allows someone with a first time DUI charge to have it reduced to a reckless driving charge. With the winter holidays fast approaching, chances are we'll be seeing an uptick in DUI arrests over the next few months. I will be answering questions on first-time DUI offenders having a chance for their charge to become a reckless driving charge.

Here is my \[proof\] ([https://www.facebook.com/LeifertLaw/posts/10158028720106559](https://www.facebook.com/LeifertLaw/posts/10158028720106559)), my \[website\] ([https://www.leifertlaw.com/](https://www.leifertlaw.com/)), and information on the \[topic\] “[Lawmaker combines 'accountability' and 'compassion' in drunk driving bill](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/07/florida-drunk-driving-bill-combines-accountability-compassion/2832048001/)” - Tallahassee Democrat

**Disclaimer**: The purpose of this Ask Me Anything is to discuss laws surrounding DUI charges in Florida and what your options are for a first time charge. My responses should not be taken as legal advice.

I’m Juan Bartolomei, MD and I’m a spine neurosurgeon at Yale who believes that surgery should be absolute last resort and have founded a comprehensive spine program in Texas. AMA!
Edit 2: Wow! Thanks so much for all your questions. I really enjoyed spending this time with all of you. I hope my answers have been helpful to some of you. I am also sorry to all those who asked questions I wasn't able to get to. We will be doing a Facebook Live in the near future to answer more questions, so if you'd like to know about that when it happens, keep an eye on the Yale Neurosurgery Facebook page at www.facebook.com/yneurosurgery. 

Edit: Thanks for all the questions so far! I have to step away for a bit to attend to meetings and clinics, but will continue answering when I have a pocket of time! 

Hi! Happy National Spine Health Month! My name is Juan Bartolomei, MD and I’m a board-certified neurosurgeon at Yale School of Medicine and acting section chief of spine surgery. In 2013, I was named one of US News and World Report’s top doctors. I trained at Yale and in the UK, and I’m passionate about helping patients avoid surgery unless necessary. If surgery is necessary, I believe in making sure their procedure takes into account the whole spine and body to ensure better outcomes. 

Disclaimer: Answering your questions does not constitute a physician-patient relationship, so this does not replace medical advice from your physician. We recommend that all Redditors who have concerns about their health to contact their providers directly.

We are political activists, policy experts, journalists, and tech industry veterans trying to stop the government from destroying encryption and censoring free speech online with the EARN IT Act. Ask us anything!
The EARN IT Act is an [unconstitutional](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-act-violates-constitution) attempt to undermine encryption services that protect our [free speech and security](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/01/letter-us-senate-judiciary-committee-reject-earn-it-act-s-3398) online. It's bad. Really bad. The bill’s authors — Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) — say that the EARN IT Act will help fight child exploitation online, but in reality, this bill gives the Attorney General sweeping new powers to control the way tech companies collect and store data, verify user identities, and censor content. It's bad. Really bad.

Later this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on whether or not the EARN IT Act will move forward in the legislative process. So we're asking [EVERYONE](https://youtu.be/KBKXu3Kg4yg) on the Internet to call these key lawmakers today and urge them to reject the EARN IT Act before it's too late. To join this day of action, please:

1. Visit [NoEarnItAct.org/call](https://www.noearnitact.org/call/)

2. Enter your phone number (it will not be saved or stored or shared with anyone)

3. When you are connected to a Senator’s office, encourage that Senator to reject the EARN IT Act

4. Press the * key on your phone to move on to the next lawmaker’s office

I am Jackie Ni, the founder of MemePAC, the largest youth-led Super PAC that produced content to unseat Donald Trump. So far, we've amassed over 7 million views on our content, over 300k followers on TikTok, and interviews with the New York Times, Good Morning America, and Business Insider.
Hey Reddit!

Jackie here. Let me start by talking about how [MemePAC](https://memepac.org) came about.

In late July, I looked for ways to do my part to rid the country of a man that has downplayed COVID-19, threatened democracy, and furthered divisions within our country. In addition to going against Rudy Giuliani, I also wanted to unseat Donald Trump.

Inspired by the Lincoln Project, I decided to create MemePAC as a Super Political Action Committee with the FEC and starting making content to release on TikTok. Unlike other Super PACs, MemePAC created alternative content like online tools/games. For example, we created a parody of Tinder but from the POV of Trump and a service that texts/emails you daily memes about Trump's atrocities.

For the first few months, MemePAC's views were growing consistently but slowly. However, after releasing our Among Us-themed video where "for every person that follows us on TikTok, Trump gets ejected," our following grew from 4,000 to 300,000 on TikTok almost overnight.

With our growing success, we started getting covered by networks such as the New York Times, The Hill, Fox Business, and even Good Morning America. But I think the most exciting coverage was Know Your Meme. It was always my dream to leave a mark on meme history and I finally did it!

At this point, it's pretty clear that Joe Biden has won. As such, MemePAC is looking to shift its focus onto issues/elections that align with our values (which are pretty close to the consensus of the democratic party). For one, we're trying to help Ossoff and Warnock win, effectively flipping the Senate blue.

**Anyways AMA!**

Also, we're looking for some new team members, whether you're a comedian, memer, programmer, researcher, or just someone who wants to see change in Capitol Hill — email me at [recruitment@memepac.org](mailto:recruitment@memepac.org).

I'm Dan Diamond, a POLITICO reporter covering the Trump administration and its coronavirus response. AMA!
Hey there! I'm a POLITICO reporter closely tracking the Trump administration and its response to the Covid-19 outbreak, in addition to broader health politics and policy. 

At POLITICO, we try to dig into the inner workings of government, and you may have seen our investigations that revealed [the existence of the pandemic playbook](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285), Trump officials' efforts to [interfere with CDC reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/11/exclusive-trump-officials-interfered-with-cdc-reports-on-covid-19-412809) and a [failed plan](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/29/hhs-ad-blitz-sputters-as-celebrities-back-away-423274) to [enlist celebrities](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/25/trump-hhs-ads-coronavirus-421957) to cut coronavirus ads.

Earlier, we broke stories on taxpayer spending on [Trump officials' private planes](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/04/how-we-found-tom-prices-private-jets-215680), [publicity contractors](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/10/seema-verma-medicaid-expenses-411539) and even [stolen jewelry](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/07/medicare-chief-asked-taxpayers-to-cover-stolen-jewelry-077761).

And even as the election results remain up in the air, the pandemic remains deeply concerning — and many Americans still [don't agree](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/01/iowa-mask-mandates-defining-issue-433763) on how to respond.

I am a 15 year old boy with brachial plexus injury. In simple words, there are numerous nerves in the Brachial / shoulder region. I was overweight for normal delivery. But the doctor conducted normal delivery. So, my left shoulder didn't have much space to come out smoothly. The doctor, though, literally pulled my hand out very hard, which resulted all the nerves to break. Now, I have permanent disability.

I desperately wish to infect a million brains with ideas about how to cut our personal carbon footprint. AMA!
The average US adult footprint is **30 tons**.  About half that is direct and half of that is indirect.

I wish to limit all of my suggestions to:

   * things that add luxury and or money to your life (no sacrifices)
   * things that a million people can do (in an apartment or with land) without being angry at bad guys

Whenever I try to share these things that make a real difference, there's always a handful of people that insist that I'm a monster because BP put the blame on the consumer.  And right now BP is laying off 10,000 people due to a drop in petroleum use.  This is what I advocate:  if we can consider ways to live a more luxuriant life with less petroleum, in time the money is taken away from petroleum.

Let's get to it ...

If you live in Montana, switching from electric heat to a rocket mass heater cuts your carbon footprint by **29 tons**.   That as much as parking 7 petroleum fueled cars.

35% of your cabon footprint is tied to your food.  You can eliminate all of that with a big enough garden.  

Switching to an electric car will cut **2 tons**.  

And the biggest of them all:  When you eat an apple put the seeds in your pocket.  Plant the seeds when you see a spot.  An apple a day could cut your carbon footprint **100 tons** per year.

We are Aadil Razack and Cheng-Ying Tsai aka Justin, two content creation directors from Ampheros Media. Ask us anything!

Ampheros Media is an organization made up of Gen Z students from around the world who provide unbiased journalistic accounts of Gen Z’s coming impacts in the following decades.  The Ampheros Journalism site, Ampheros Podcasting, and Ampheros YouTube channel are all extensions of the organization. We don’t limit our definition of minorities to race.  A minority is any group not in the majority, but with an important opinion nonetheless.  We believe that this is imperative to avoiding the problems that many democracies today face with populism and misinformation, even if the subject matter is already widely established. Feel free to visit us at [ampheros.com](https://ampheros.com/)!

[Proof 1](https://ampheros.com/meet-our-team/)

Edit: since this seems to be a common question, we don't proclaim ourselves to be the most credible news organization. One of our goals is to provide students with the opportunity to create articles, documentaries, or podcasts that covers areas that aren't common seen. At the end of the day, we're students with a passion for journalism, not professionals.

Edit 2: I guess that's that. It's been a very fruitful discussion; time for dinner. We sort of lost track of questions halfway through so if we haven't answered you and you still want us to reply, just tag us in your comment. Thanks to everyone for participating, wishing us well, and above all, providing us with much-needed constructive criticism on how to better develop and present our organization. Cheers!

###[Link to AMA on r/Political_Revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/ghtyx8/the_south_bronx_is_having_its_first_contested/)

Hey everyone!

My name is Samelys López, and I'm a candidate for New York's 15th Congressional District, which is entirely in the South Bronx. We've been represented by Jose Serrano for 30 years, but he's stepping down.

There are now over 12 people running in the Democratic primary on June 23, including a homophobic Republican who drove Ted Cruz around the Bronx, a City Councilmember who's taken in tens of thousands of dollars from real estate developers, and people who don't even live in the South Bronx.
I am running on a platform to center the needs of the most vulnerable first. We've often been called the poorest congressional district in the country, but we're also the home of salsa, hip hop, and the Young Lords. I'm a part of that rich history of innovation, and taking that to Washington.

While there I will fight for:
* A Homes Guarantee, ensuring that housing is a universal human right for every American
* Medicare for All, so that nobody is denied care or goes bankrupt because of illness
* A Universal Basic Income of at least $2000 a month, so that everyone is able to put food on the table
* Universal childcare, repealing the Hyde Amendment, a $15 minimum wage, a Federal Jobs Guarantee through the Green New Deal, and more

When I was a child, my family experienced homelessness, and I vowed to make sure no other little girl went through what I went through. My policies and campaign style reflect that promise. We're not taking a dime of corporate cash, and the establishment is scared. Our movement has been [endorsed](https://lopezforthepeople.com/endorsements) by New York City DSA, AOC, Tiffany Cabán, Zephyr Teachout, the Working Families Party, Sunrise NYC, and more! 

Ask me anything about my policies, running for Congress in a COVID-19 hotspot, the South Bronx, or me!

As a California licensed physician who has evaluated thousands of patients for the use of medical cannabis, I have seen people have tremendous improvement in the quality of their lives with this amazing plant medicine.  My new book, Cannabis is Medicine, explains how cannabis works within the human body to balance, repair and protect us when we are injured, ill or inflamed.  Now that there are so many phytocannabinoids available for patients to use - such as CBD, THC, THCA, CBDA, etc - it can be overwhelming when trying to figure out what will be effective.  My new book aims to help patients and loved ones sort out the truth about cannabis and how to use it as medicine.

I'm a Psychotherapist. Ask me anything about Mindfulness Meditation for treating anxiety
Disclaimer:  This post is for educational and informational purposes only and not a substitute for mental health counseling.”

A lot of my clients come to see me about anxiety and panic attacks and one of the first things I teach them is to use **Mindfulness Meditation** as a daily practice.  Starting at one minute per day (and gradually increasing as it becomes more natural), and maybe using a helpful meditation app like [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/meditation-app), I ask them to focus on their breath.

Here's the important part:  when you notice your mind has wandered, non-judgmentally and with a Kind Inner Voice, return your attention to your breath.  Each time you successfully return your attention to your breath, congratulate yourself.  THIS is the skill you're trying to develop!

So many clients have told me:  "I can't meditate, it makes me sleepy" or "I can't meditate, my mind is too busy with swirling thoughts" or "I can't meditate, focusing internally takes me to dark places."  These are all really good points, and why I encourage people to start at **One Minute per Day**, and to only increase when meditation becomes so comfortable and natural that, at the end of the minute, they find themselves saying "Wow, that's over already?".

The purpose of Mindfulness Meditation in counseling (as opposed to other forms and intentions of meditative practices) is **NOT to become calm**!  The purpose is to notice when our minds have wandered off and to be able to return our attention to **the Present Moment**, using our breath as an anchor.  Allowing our minds to wander to our pasts often results in negative thought spirals, leading to Depression.  Allowing our minds to wander to the future often results in anxiety and panic attacks.  Returning our minds to the present moment permits us to have **peace and gratitude**, and to function effectively in our lives.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on Mindfulness Meditation.

Hi, I’m Subir Grewal, financial markets veteran, CPA, and author of the new, free book "Struggling Amidst Plenty: A Layperson's Guide to Our Awful Monetary System, Why it’s the Root Cause of Inequality, Debt, and “Too Big to Fail,” &amp; The Little-Known Way to Fix It." Ask me anything!
A FREE PDF or epub version of the book can be found here: [https://gumroad.com/l/iIZJM](https://gumroad.com/l/iIZJM)

A paid paperback or Kindle version can be found here: [https://www.amazon.com/Struggling-Amidst-Plenty-Laypersons-Little-Known-ebook/dp/B086JBWHWZ/ref=tmm\_kin\_swatch\_0?\_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1588190711&amp;sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Struggling-Amidst-Plenty-Laypersons-Little-Known-ebook/dp/B086JBWHWZ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1588190711&amp;sr=8-1)

I wrote this book as a civic service because most people have no idea how flawed and outdated our current monetary system is, and how it's the root cause of rampant inequality today.  We need to go upstream and examine the actual mechanisms of the system, instead of just addressing symptoms as our leaders are currently doing, in a futile fashion.  Monetary economics needs to evolve, but the systematic limitations its profession are preventing it from evolving.  We need monetary literacy in order to move human civilization forward.

That's why Step 1 is spreading education among everyday people, so we can force our political leaders on BOTH sides of the aisle to evolve.  It's also why I wrote this book.  It's non-partisan and not married to any "ism."  As the book shows, prominent on BOTH sides of the aisle support these ideas.

(Oh, and before you ask: I'm not here to promote the gold standard, Bitcoin, or more government borrowing.)

Hey Reddit!

I'm Alex Applegate, Marketing Manager for Bontrager on the bike products, here for my first ever AMA!

I'm here with Sam Foos ([u/Sam\_Trek](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sam_Trek/)), Marketing Manager for Bontrager off the bike products. We're excited to give you the inside line on all things Bontrager and bikes!

I've been in the Bontrager marketing group since 2014 or so, and have been with Trek for almost 10 years overall. I've got an awesome job that touches all aspects of how a bike performs and what what you can do with that bike. I work closely with the design, engineering, and product teams to help tell the stories of all the great products that they bring to life.

We would love to help answer any burning Bontrager questions that may have or share info on behind the scenes at Trek and Bontrager!

We'll start taking your questions at **11a.m. central** right here on [r/TrekBikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrekBikes/)!

Hi Reddit, AMA Complete as of 18:47
------------------------------------------
I'm Sarah, a Professor at The University of Manchester. I'm using my astrophysics research background to identify ways to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions... from food. Ask me Anything!
EDIT 2PM: This AMA is now closed - thank you so much for all your fantastic questions! 



Hi Reddit, Sarah here! I have been studying dark matter and dark energy for the last 20 years, but when my kids started school I started to think about our own planet in the next 20 years and beyond. I learned about climate change properly for the first time, how it threatens worldwide food production, and how food causes about a quarter of all global warming. I wanted to know how much each of my food choices was contributing, and why. Did you know, if we stopped burning fossil fuels, food would be the biggest contributor to climate change?

I delved into the academic research literature, and summarized the results in simple charts. The charts make it easy for the non-specialist to see the impacts of different meal options, and show that some easy food switches can reduce food greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent. Most of us make many food choices every day, and by changing these we can significantly reduce climate change caused by food, and free up land that can be used to help reduce climate change overall.

There is an impending perfect storm of pressure on our food production system, with increasing population and changing consumer tastes, in the face of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Tim Gore, head of food policy and climate change for Oxfam, said “The main way that most people will experience climate change is through the impact on food: the food they eat, the price they pay for it, and the availability and choice that they have.”. Yet, at the same time, food production causes about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, and this is rising as the population increases and becomes more affluent. 

My book, Food and Climate Change -- Without the Hot Air, is published today by UIT Cambridge in 2020 www.sarahbridle.net/faccwtha #faccwtha You can get the e-book for free, thanks to funding from the University of Manchester e.g. in the UK the free ebook is available from amazon here https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Climate-Change-without-hot-ebook/dp/B0873WWT6W

Most of the facts and figures in my replies below are explained in more detail there - with full references to the original research literature.

IAMA Engineering Manager for a team of software developers - ask me anything about hiring, managing, tech, skills,...
Me: Engineering manager for a team of software developers doing ecommerce websites. As a consutancy, we work for many different non-tech clients, mostly in Germany. But have also worked in different kinds of companies, from a prototypical garage startup to large enterprises. I am based in Germany, so quite different from the typical silicon valley start-up scene.

Proof: Was submitted to the mods 

Have been in the software industry for 15 years - started as a developer, then moved to consulting and project management, then became a manager 4 years ago. Started with a few interns and students, and grew the team to 10+ developers.

Tech stack: mostly Java and web-based.

As a university student, I was pretty clueless about how the industry really worked, so I'd like to help out anybody who is looking to break into the software industry with some inside information.

Ask me anything about:

\- how recruiting and hiring works, what I look for, how you can get a job as a software developer

\- what job interviews are like, how to write your resume, whether you need a github repo

\- what life as a software devevloper is like. What kind of jobs there are, and what kind of companies you want to work for

\- what technologies are important to know

\- anything else you like

I will answer every question - not necessarily right away, due to time zones (I'm in Germany). Also, as a non-native speaker, please excuse language mistakes.

IAmA Cellist Working to Help Bring Classical Music into the 21st Century...Ask Me Anything!
Recent years have brought huge innovations to the field of classical music. But there's still a long way to go, as we take a discipline that's been around for so long and try to make it as compatible as we can with modern life. Especially now, when traditional concert presentations can't happen due to the public health risk they pose, we need to innovate. As someone who's had a lifelong side passion for all things tech, I founded [celloben.com](https://celloben.com), where I'm working to bring more music and learning onto an online platform, and I'm staying vigilant to see where I can help the community remotely. So if you're wondering about my field from an insider's point of view, and how the music we make can come to life even when we can't play together in person, or any other questions you have...ask me anything!

Cheers, and hope everyone's staying safe and healthy,

#[Link to AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g8zsl6/im_john_turner_author_of_they_knew_they_were/)

&gt; Hello everyone, I'm [John Turner](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/johngturner.com), professor of religious studies at George Mason University.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm here to talk about They Knew They Were Pilgrims: Plymouth Colony and the Contest for American Liberty (Yale University Press). If you think you learned more than you needed to know about the Pilgrims and Plymouth Colony in elementary school, think again. This is a book that features the *Mayflower* passengers but also introduces a wide variety of Native communities and many different groups of English settlers.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the overview:
&gt; 
&gt; *In 1620, separatists from the Church of England set sail across the Atlantic aboard the Mayflower. Understanding themselves as spiritual pilgrims, they left to preserve their liberty to worship God in accordance with their understanding of the Bible.*
&gt; 
&gt; *There exists, however, an alternative, more dispiriting version of their story. In it, the Pilgrims are religious zealots who persecuted dissenters and decimated Native peoples through warfare and by stealing their land. The Pilgrims’ definition of liberty was, in practice, very narrow.*
&gt; 
&gt; *Drawing on original research using underutilized sources, John G. Turner moves beyond these familiar narratives in his sweeping and authoritative new history of Plymouth Colony. Instead of depicting the Pilgrims as otherworldly saints or extraordinary sinners, he tells how a variety of English settlers and Native peoples engaged in a contest for the meaning of American liberty.*
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be here for the next few hours (from about 10:00 until about 1:00 Eastern) to talk all things Plymouth Colony, so please flood this thread with questions!

Hey, ya’ll! I’m Jenelle Marie Pierce, and I have genital herpes! I am also a Sexual Health Educator, Executive Director of The STI Project, and an Adjunct Professor. I’m here to eradicate the stigma surrounding STIs by sharing my experience and normalizing the conversation around sexual health. AMA!
I’m so excited to be able to answer any questions you may have on STIs and specifically, herpes! After working in public health for the last decade, I’ve pretty much heard it all, and there’s no topic or question that’s too weird or too awk. Herpes, in particular, is something that carries a huge stigma with it, but it’s largely unnecessary. Many people think that herpes is shameful (spoiler alert: it’s not), because most of us are clueless about it, but it’s a lot more common than you think, and it doesn’t have to change or limit anything in your life.

I am a cruise ship worker currently trapped at sea. AMA!
**My short bio:** I have worked at sea for a few years now, and was unlucky enough to be at sea when all of the 'rona started. I have not set foot on land since March 14th. 

I worked for the cruise company Holland America Line as part of the entertainment team. My ship has been fighting for weeks with the CDC and the US government to let me back into the country, even though I am a US citizen. I'm happy to answer any questions here about what it's like to be at sea for extended periods of time, or what it's like to work at sea in general.

**My Proof:**

[An article about me](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/28/coronavirus-holland-america-oosterdam-cruise-ship-stranded-at-sea/)

EDIT: ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

* Am I being paid? No.

* Have you filed for unemployment? My internet is not strong enough yet. I'm going to try as soon as I get back on land.

* Is anyone onboard sick? No. Or at least, they have not made any announcements about that. Everyone is getting fever tested twice a day.

* How's the food? A bit lower than guest quality, but generally good. [Here's a picture of dinner!](https://imgur.com/a/nFjZoOm) 

* How do you get food? They deliver it to me three meals a day.

* How's the room? It is a 200sq ft cabin to myself. I spend around 20+ hours a day in here alone. I have a balcony and a double bed. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/a/hjwOymp)

* How much is the internet? it's $10 per gigabyte, and the connection is extremely spotty. It drops out usually every 20 and 30 minutes for me, and takes a few minutes to pick back up again. Even phone calls over WhatsApp are hard to make.

* Why don't you jump? It is incredibly dangerous to jump overboard a moving ship. If you jump over the side, there is a good chance that the current drags you underneath the ship and into the propellers. If you jump over the back, the water is heavily aerated and you will get sucked under again. If you manage to swim to the top / hold your breath long enough, you will die of dehydration and exposure if you don't make it to land.

* What happened when you tried to leave the ship? [longer comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gfc3p7/i_am_a_cruise_ship_worker_currently_trapped_at/fpt5vfl)

Edit: the current plan is for me to disembark tomorrow in Los Angeles. However, that was the plan more than a week ago too. I don't have flight details or anything yet. We'll see!

Edit2: I should theoretically be disembarking tomorrow! That being said, I have answered literally hundreds of questions. I am sorry if I missed yours, though I skipped some that were frequent repeats. I will continue answering tonight and tomorrow!

Edit 3: it is tomorrow and we are docked in Los Angeles! I still won't believe I am on land until my feet hit the ground. Other crew got as far as getting to the airport, before they were forced to turn back to the ship. If that happens to me, I will riot^just^kidding^iftheshipisreading

Edit 4: **I AM OFF THAT DAM SHIP. WE DOCKED IN LOS ANGELES AND THEY FINALLY LET ME OFF. THANK YOU ALL FOE YOUR WELL WISHES!**

I am Kai Strittmatter. I have written a book on China, the mechanisms of dictatorship and digital totalitarianism. Actually it is also a book about us. AMA
Hej from Copenhagen. My name is Kai. I grew up in a little village in the Bavarian alps, went on to study Chinese and ended up devoting more than half of my life to the study and observation of China, many years as a reporter in Beijing for the German national daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Over the course of more than 30 years I have made invaluable friendships in China, eaten the best food in the world and seen the country change, for the better and for the worse. 
 
The past seven years under the leadership of China’s strong man Xi Jinping have been especially remarkable. Repression and censorship are as strong as they haven’t been for decades, ideology has crept back. At the same time Xi Jinping is reinventing dictatorship with the means of AI and Big Data, he is giving autocratic rule a digital update. All the while China is growing more assertive on the international stage. Competition of systems is back - and it comes at a time when liberal democracy finds itself in the midst of a deep crisis. 

For me this challenge we have to rise up to was the main reason to write my book, We Have Been Harmonized.
 
So go ahead and ask me anything: about the new China, about the new us, about reporting from China, about the best noodles on the planet, why everybody should learn Chinese or why I started working on my book the night when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.

IamA 31 year old male who has now lost his testicle to testicular cancer. Update with before and after sperm count, testosterone and more! AMA
Hey Reddit, so I ended up having the surgery July 6th. It was a radical orchiectomy and they cut an incision around my pubic area. They pulled the left testicle out and all the giblets attached. Well I survived and have some updates:

Sperm Count: So I went to the sperm bank before the surgery and then a few weeks after ther surgery. I asked the doctor at the sperm bank to compare my results and he sent me back this "What you want to look at is the Total Motility. Your first collection had a TOMO ( before we processed it) of 106. Whereas yesterday’s collection has a TOMO (pre-processing) of 60.9. The sperm counts were almost identical. But your first collection had a volume of 3.36 and you second collection had a volume of 1.82. But yes, it does make sense with the drop in volume and with one producing testicle it still looks like you have a decent amount of motile sperm cells."

Testosterone: So before the surgery I took a testosterone test and it came out to 461. I started feeling really tired and had zero energy. I was worried that just having one working testicle was leaving me a less than average amount of testosterone. So I went back and got a new testosterone test and the results came back at a 500! So that was some good news, righty tighty came in clutch and picked up the slack and then some!

Cancer: So there was a 2 inch seminole cancer in my left testicle. My doctor said if had to choose a cancer to get it would be that one. They wouldn't let me keep it, I asked!

Radiation: My doctor recommended getting radiation. He said if I didn't there's a 30% chance the cancer could come back in my lymph nodes or my lungs. However if I do radiation, then that chance drops to below 5%. I went to my first radiation appointment last week and it wasn't fun. Had to put my scrotum in a lead ball to protect it from the rays. It was heavy and kept pinching my skin. Then the doctor gave me three little tattoos, one on each hip and then one near my pubic area. It was so that the machine could be calibrated to my body exactly every time. I have to do this for the 4-5 weeks and then i'm DONE!!!! I will be a regular guy with a little less junk in my hood!

So those are the big updates, ask me anything! Also from my last post a lot of guys reached out about their own ball issues and I couldn't reply to you all. However here is my best advice, if you go to a family doctor and he says you shouldn't worry about it and you go home and are still worried about it; GO TO A UROLOGIST! A family doctor cupped my balls gently and said it was just veins but a urologist went in there and moved those veins and really grabbed the cancer by the balls!

I’m currently the founder and CEO of [Block Party](https://blockpartyapp.com), a consumer app to help solve online harassment. Previously, I was a software engineer at Pinterest, Quora, and Facebook. 

I’m most known for my work in tech activism. In 2013, I helped establish the standard for tech company diversity data disclosures with a Medium post titled [“Where are the numbers?”](https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252) and a Github repository collecting data on women in engineering.

Then in 2016, I co-founded the non-profit [Project Include](https://projectinclude.org/) which works with tech startups on diversity and inclusion towards the mission of giving everyone a fair chance to succeed in tech.

Over the years as an advocate for diversity, I’ve faced constant/severe online harassment. I’ve been stalked, threatened, mansplained and trolled by reply guys, and spammed with crude unwanted content. Now as founder and CEO of Block Party, I hope to help others who are in a similar situation. We want to put people back in control of their online experience with our tool to help filter through unwanted content.

Ask me about diversity in tech, entrepreneurship, the role of platforms to handle harassment, online safety, anything else.

Hi, I’m Scott Guerin and I have spent my life pursuing the question, Does spirituality exist outside of religion?
I am a psychologist and have been passionately pursuing God, Spirit and religion since I was a teenager. The best way to describe my message is when you go to a shopping mall or a new town, many times there is a map of the area. On that map there is usually a red dot indicating YOU ARE HERE. This is exactly what I would like to help you realize. I do not promote any specific beliefs or theological perspectives but talk about and explore key topics related to the psychological, theological, and emotional aspects of spirituality. My greatest hope is to provide you things to think about as you assess where you are in your spiritual journey and plan your path forward.

IAmA recovering patient that suffered from Pectus Excavatum. I just had the Nuss procedure completed after I found out about it on r/IAmA about 6 years ago and want to pay it forward! At 27 years old I am the oldest patient my surgeon ever operated on. Ask me anything!
Excuse the possibly incoherent text. I'm fading in and out due to the amount of morphine I'm on.

I (27M) suffered from a condition called Pectus Excavatum, a defect in the sternum that causes the chest to sink inwards. It can apply pressure to the heart and lungs which can lead to complications with breathing.

The condition is usually treated early on when the defect is first noticed in middle school or highschool (13-15yo)

The cardiologist I saw for the procedure advocated heavily against  corrective surgery when I met with him 14 years ago. The procedure he was aware of involved cutting the sternum, breaking ribs and installing a metal plate.

Many patients who had this procedure done experience chronic pain afterwards and their quality of life decreased
. While I experienced shortness of breath and chest pain during exercise, I weighed the options and decided not to go through with the surgery as I could lead a relatively normal life that I could jeopardize with the procedure.

6 or so years ago I saw an AmA on the front page about a highschool student getting his pectus excavatum corrected with a totally different procedure.

Instead of cutting the ribs and reinforcing with a plate, a minimally invasive procedure is done. The surgeon makes a 4in incision below each armpit. One is used for an endoscope and through the other, a titanium bar with the exact contour if the corrected chest cavity is inserted and rotated into place. This forces the ribs into place from the inside.

At the time I was considering millitary service and after many doctors appointments it was determined that the best course of action for me would be to enlist with a doctors note stating my heart was sound and I was for omit the shortness of breath and chest pain.

Fast forward to last year and I made the decision not to enlist. I also started a job with great health benefits. I spoke with my parents and girlfriend about finally having the surgery done and we all agreed.

I started researching the Nuss procedure

Modified Nuss Procedure for Pectus Excavatum - YouTube

 and was delighted that one of the most experienced surgeons in the world, Dr Mark Stovroff was a measily 20 drive away!  Dr Stovroff even helped develop the modified procedure into what it is today.

I was supposed to have the procedure done in February but it was postponed several times due to COVID19. I am now recovering in the ICU after finally having my procedure completed with fantastic results! Ask me anything!

Pictures! More to come, no one is allowed to stay with me and I can't move on my own to take pictures

IAm Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I’m making a show - with YOU - all about staying creative during this pandemic. AMA…
Watch the announcement video for Create Together [here](https://hitrecord.org/records/4394206?no_meta=true&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=createtogether)
 
Hello, dear Redditors. Hope you’re all safe and doing alright. 
 
I just announced that I’m making a short form mini-series about people coping with this strange and trying time of pandemic and isolation by staying creative together. 
 
As I’ve done before, I’m opening up the creative process for anybody to collaborate on it. So if you’re an artist of any kind, writer, actor, musician, filmmaker, expert, beginner, whatever, I’d love for you to come jump in. We’ll be doing it on HITRECORD, so if you’re interested, you can come to our site or download our app: [ios](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitrecord-are-we-recording/id984939409) / [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hitrecord.android.hitrecord&amp;hl=en_US)
 
If you haven’t heard me talk about HITRECORD before (then you’ve never paid an iota of attention to what I’ve been putting out online with relentless consistency for years on end), it’s a community for creative collaboration that I started a long time ago with my brother, dan. People don’t just post things they’ve made on their own, amass followers, and get addicted to likes. We make things together—short films, short documentaries, music videos, etc. 

Whenever we launch stuff like this, my hope is always that it'll start a conversation. So let’s talk—about the show, the pandemic, art, life, artful life, lifeless art, golden rabbits, horse-sized ducks, etc.

Ask me anything...
And, proof that I’m actually sitting here typing this, not paying other people to write this shit for me, because I’m not, I’m really really not, at least not with my own money, that’s what the YouTube budget is for: [proof](https://hitrecord.org/records/4394766?no_meta=true&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=createtogether)

Okay, signing off for now. Thanks for the conversation everyone, good talk :) Stay safe, as much as you can, stay creative, and say thanks a lot.

Toxic Acute Progressive Leukoencephalopathy: Check! Locked In Syndrome: Check! Pseudocoma: Check! Coronavirus: TBD...

I had Toxic Acute Progressive Leukoencephalopathy:. I am the only documented case of recovery from stage 4. I have recovered to the point of getting out of long term care, and back to acute care. This means I only have acute leukoencephalopathy now. I was about to be transferred from long term care to acute care when a coronavirus outbreak struck the facility I was in. I started to show symptoms, and it was what I feared. This essentially has put all of my progress on hold. All of my therapies have been cancelled for the foreseeable future. I am also feeling weak from Covid19.  

I am in Mass General Hospital under careful observation just in case. I will overcome this — just like everything else. I will get back to learning how to walk, eloquently talk, and wipe my own ass. I did not recover from being locked in to be taken out Covid19!

Ask me anything, (but keep back 6 feet)!
I will get back to you. 
Unfortunately my iPad mount broke, which will consequently result in a slower response time, though I will respond back to all of you.

Hi AMA!

First time writing this my text got deleted so I’m gonna keep it brief: I worked as the party planner at my store for all of last year.  I was in charge of calling parents to get info, setting up, assigning other hosts to ones I couldnt do, etc.  I also did all other work in the restaurant (kitchen, register, Gameroom, etc.).  I was close friends w my bosses, had a great working relationship with the district manager, and met the VP.   Edit- I left at the end of November before they filed for bankruptcy

With the bankruptcy announcement I figured I’d do an AMA, since it’s kinda topical and people might have unanswered questions from childhood

And I’m just gonna get this one out of the way: of course they don’t salvage and reheat slices.  The business operates as a restaurant first business, doing something like that would get them shut down so quick.  If the pizza were to have gone back in the oven, it would have burned guaranteed (we warn people before they request theirs get reheated if it was left idle on their table for a while).  It has an uneven shape because it’s hand stretched dough, which allows for occasionally uneven circles, and the pies get cut with a type of rolling machete, which can often warp the slices if done fast (like in a Saturday rush).  Everything is made to order.  Dough is even prepared and made in house

Lightening edit- I can add more proof if needed, it would just require me digging my old name tag up which I just didn’t feel like doing rn cuz I’m cleaning and don’t want to make a mess unnecessarily

Edit 2- wow ok this got more popular Than I thought it would.  I have a date in a few hours but I’ll just keep answering questions til then and then maybe after

Edit 3- ok I’ve answered every question in my inbox that wasn’t about Shane Dawson or fights or the play place (stuff that was frequently asked) so I’m gonna go ahead and mute notifications on this post for now because I have to get ready for my date now.  I’ll check back in later tonight to see if there’s anymore unique/more personally related questions, but if not, I had fun!  Thanks for helping me while away my afternoon, everyone :))

Hey Reddit, we're the Trek Performance Research team! Ask Us Anything! [crosspost]
Our AMA is being hosted [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrekBikes/comments/gsuhn4/hey_reddit_were_the_trek_performance_research/)

\--------------------------------------------

Hi Reddit, we are Trek Performance Research, and we are a group of technical specialists, supporting all development teams with a focus on R&amp;D. Join some of our team for a Trek Bikes AMA. Ask us all about structural analysis, aerodynamics, biomechanics, or advanced experimentation.

You can read a little bit about us on the [blog](https://blog.trekbikes.com/en/author/trek-performance-research/) or get in the weeds of some of our recent contributions in the [Madone SLR](http://trek.scene7.com/is/content/TrekBicycleProducts/TK18_Madone_Whitepaper_EN-GB.pdf) or [XXX wheels](http://trek.scene7.com/is/content/TrekBicycleProducts/BT18_LAUNCH_Aeolus_XXX_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepapers.

Who you can expect to answer some of your questions:

**Paul Harder**, Principal Experimental Analysis Engineer – [nobody knows what he’s talking about, but he seems pretty smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYpicF3JUpg)

**Jay Maas**, Principal Stress Analysis Engineer – if he’s not in his dark corner of the office making our bikes better, he’s [pinning on a number to test the limits](https://www.instagram.com/p/BF2p2L8ulpQ/).

**Kyle Russ**, Senior Biomechanical Engineer – different [haircut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbuU1FQREcI&amp;t=73s), same Kyle

**John Davis**, Aerodynamicist – ask about his sourdough…on second thought…don’t ask about his sourdough

**Zach Butler**, Manager – pretty much just tries to stay out of the way

Collectively, we’ve got 40 years of experience at Trek, so ask us anything!\*

\*We'll start answering your questions at 11am central!

I am Jeff Galak, Professor of Marketing and Social and Decision Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I have published dozens of academic papers on decision making, consumer behavior, happiness, gift giving, and more. I have also recently launched a new YouTube channel called Data Demystified AMA!
Hi Reddit, Jeff Galak here and I’m excited to share with you what life is like as a Professor at a top research institution…especially during the pandemic. I’ve studied human behavior for over 15 years and happy to talk about anything related to that as well. If you want to see what I’ve been working on, have a look here:

[List of Research Papers](http://jeffgalak.com/publications-and-papers/)

Some research topics include:

*Consumer happiness

*Habituation / Hedonic Adaptation / Satiation / Hedonic Decline

*Psychology of gift giving

*Decision Making

*Political Psychology
 

I’m also really passionate about teaching people to work with data. I’ve been teaching a methods course for years and have found that what everyone needs is a deep INTUITION for thinking about statistics, data analytics, whatever you want to call it. To that end, I started a new YouTube channel where I put out weekly videos that try to build data intuition by using interesting and important topics as ways to get people excited and then I sneak in some statistical concepts (without any jargon or math…just understanding!). Happy to talk about why I’m doing this and why. Here’s the channel for those curious:

[Data Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzEmcsawWvM1GGesDCeX_lQ/)

Finally, I’m a husband and father of two kids (3yo boy and 6yo girl). If you want to know what THAT’S like…again, especially during a pandemic, AMA.

Looking forward to answering all your questions.

I had a rare tumor on my skull when I was 14 (about a year ago), AMA
Alright - before I say anything at all, I know this has been faked in the past and I'll likely be suspected to attempting that. Yes, this is a throwaway account, for two reasons. One, I don't want to milk this for karma, and frankly, I'd feel bad if I got karma on my main acc for something like this. And second, if people accuse me of faking this, I don't want my main account downvote bombed.

This gets a little long, tldr at the end. 

With that out the way, I don't really know a great way of showing proof. I don't feel particularly comfortable showing my doctor's papers, and even if I wanted to, I'm not near those atm. However, I do have a part of my skull missing (more on that later), as well as a scar on the back of my head, and I tried my best to show that, though it's hard as I have long hair.

So, backstory, about a year ago (actually probably a bit more than a year), I had slight headaches and felt like I had a slight bulge on the back of my head. My mom didn't really believe me at first and thought I just had headaches from being on my computer too much lol. Eventually though, we saw our doctor, and after a few visits to different doctors, I was diagnosed with langerhans cell histiocytosis. Which is essentially, well, a tumor chewing away at my skull (or that's how I understood it at least).

Luckily we went to the doctor early enough that it didn't actually get to my brain yet, and soon, I had to have a surgery, which was to literally remove a small part of my skull on the back of the head, the part of it that had the tumor on it. I'm pretty sure they scraped it away? I'm honestly not sure, I never really questioned what the surgery actually was, I guess because the whole situation was so surreal to me.

That was pretty much my only major hospital experience ever so far. I never had a broken bone or anything. And man, hospitals suck.

Anyway, I luckily didn't undergo chemotherapy, which I mean, phew. There's still a possibility the tumor gets worse again, but the chances aren't too big. Though I don't wanna assume anything. Right now as I understand it, there's still bits of the tumor left, but they're not growing or doing anything, and it's essentially possible for me to just live my whole life with them just sitting there.

Ofc my whole understanding of everything isn't great, so I could have probably got a lot of stuff wrong. Anyways, AMA.

TLDR: i was diagnosed with langerhans cell histiocytosis, had the part of my skull with the tumor removed, i luckily didn't undergo chemotherapy, there's a small chance the tumor grows again but it's minimal.

The most proof i could think of, my face with me holding a paper with my reddit username, and me trying my best to show the back of my head.

I AamA father of an autistic daughter and a molecular biologist. When my daughter was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, I began an in-depth study of genetic components of autism. I believe that every autistic individual has gifts and need to be recognized so that the individual can thrive.
Dear Reddit, 

I am Dr. Richard Williams. I am the father of an autistic daughter and a molecular biologist. I began my prolific research into autism in order to better understand and advocate for my daughter who is on the spectrum. I bring years of in-depth and comprehensive study of the genetic components of autism. 

I aim to bring you new perspectives and the latest research on autism science, as well as helpful advice about navigating life on the spectrum, for you, a family member or your child. If one were to count the presence of autistic traits as being on the autistic spectrum, the spectrum might include as much as 20% of the population!

I am a retired university professor and researcher of molecular genetics and microbiology, and a former World Health Organization-affiliated researcher. I believe that every individual is endowed with gifts – they simply need to be discovered, nurtured and encouraged. I am convinced from my work, research, and my own experiences raising an autistic daughter, that autism is, in some ways, a misunderstood blessing.

Battery discarded, I am an ex-Amazon employee
I worked at Amazon in Seattle as a full-time salary blue badge employee between the years 2010-2018.

I had a successful career here until something we like to call being "burned out" hit me. I did not fully realize what was happening to me at the time. I switched teams multiple times, took a medical leave of absence for roughly one year where I was diagnosed with "acute stress disorder". Depression and anxiety consumed my mind. I was lost and did not know what to do. I fell into the drug game, where I walked down a path of self-destruction.

I returned to Amazon after my medical leave, where I began to work at home most of the days. I was given a transitional work assignment that I cannot recall from memory what the details were. From what I recall from memory, I was at Amazon 1-2 months where I can personally say I was underperforming compared to my own standards of how I remembered myself.

Then one day, my home was raided by the DEA. Once they took me out of handcuffs I received a letter from Amazon that was sitting on my front porch. I was terminated due to "unexcused absences", where Amazon deemed I was in violation of the company policy. I told one of the agents what the letter stated, their response "double-whammy".

Things went south for my life afterward. I ended up homeless, to put it lightly.

Ask me whatever you want. I will do my best to provide an unbiased answer based on my life experiences.

EDIT: On 7/15/2020 I filed a report with the Amazon Ethics group. In the report I asked if Amazon would like to conduct an exit interview with me. On 7/14/2020 I sent an email to jeff@amazon.com in regards to an exit interview. Amazon never offered me an exit interview, as far as I recall.

IAmA peaceful protester that was at LA Fairfax yesterday
For context- I was there from noon to about 5pm. Was with the group that marched from Pan Pacific Park down Beverly, passed Robertson. On the way back I encountered the group at Fairfax where the police lines and burnt cop cars were. Police cars showed up, started firing tear gas, and we ran. It was 99% peaceful, when someone would act out, everyone else shouted them down. I dont know how the cop cars got there, there were no signs or reports of injured cops. Most people were saying it was an outsider, possibly undercover cops, that planted them. I'm not sure how any other explanation would make sense but nothing is confirmed. Ask me anything.

I’ve had a 71-year career in nuclear energy and have seen many setbacks but believe strongly that nuclear power can provide a clean, reliable, and relatively inexpensive source of energy to the world. AMA
I’ve been involved in nuclear energy since 1947.  In that year, I started working on nuclear energy at Argonne National Laboratories on safe and effective handling of spent nuclear fuel. In 2018 I retired from government work at the age of 92 but I continue to be involved in learning and educating about safe nuclear power.

After my time at Argonne, I obtained a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from MIT and was an assistant professor there for 4 years, worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 18 years where I served as the Deputy Director of Chemical Technology Division, then for the Atomic Energy Commission starting in 1972, where I served as the Director of General Energy Development. In 1984 I was working for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, trying to develop a long-term program for nuclear waste repositories, which was going well but was ultimately canceled due to political opposition.

Since that time I’ve been working primarily in the US Department of Energy on nuclear waste management broadly — recovery of unused energy, safe disposal, and trying as much as possible to be in touch with similar programs in other parts of the world (Russia, Canada, Japan, France, Finland, etc.) I try to visit and talk with people involved with those programs to learn and help steer the US’s efforts in the right direction.

My daughter and son-in-law will be helping me manage this AMA, reading questions to me and inputing my answers on my behalf.  (EDIT: This is also being posted from my son-in-law's account, as I do not have a Reddit account of my own.) Ask me anything.

Proof: [**https://i.imgur.com/fG1d9NV.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/fG1d9NV.jpg)

EDIT 1: After about 3 hours we are now wrapping up.  This was fun. I've enjoyed it thoroughly!  It's nice to be asked the questions and I hope I can provide useful information to people. I love to just share what I know and help the field if I can do it.

EDIT 2: Son-in-law and AMA assistant here!  **I notice many questions about nuclear waste disposal.** **I will highlight** [**this answer**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/is5qrd/ive_had_a_71year_career_in_nuclear_energy_and/g55vkkp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that includes thoughts on the topic.

IAmA Texan living in Spain. I run a global community that helps women age 30+ break free from a life of routine and start a life of travel. I wrote THE GUIDE on viable visas for moving Europe. AMA about moving abroad (especially Europe), living abroad, untethering your life via remote work, etc!
Hi all! My name is Cepee, rhymes with peppy, and I help women age 30+ break free from a life of routine and start a life of travel, i.e. move abroad, quit their job to travel the world, and find remote work to untether their life. More about me and what I do [here](https://shehitrefresh.com/about/). Here is [press coverage](https://shehitrefresh.com/press/) for social proof. And last the photo Reddit requested for [proof of identity](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D9dMdboa9pmn0aTBv1Oa26tjywsJSyaB/view?usp=sharing). 

I've been trying to make long-term living in Europe happen for decades, moving back and forth from Texas to Spain trying to find a way to make it work on my terms. I didn't want to teach English but that seemed to be the only option...until I found another way! I've been living in Madrid since 2015 on 3 different visas- student, work, and now non-lucrative. I moved on from teaching, started working remotely and now run my own business where I help others make their BIG travel dreams a reality! I share about my journey and how moving abroad changed my life in this Google for Startups [talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZV2re5UrZM&amp;t=1s).

Whether you are a man or woman of any age I'm happy to answer Redditors questions on moving abroad, living abroad, or untethering your life via remote work. I know a lot of people think it's impossible or unattainable but I want to let you know that it's not!

I’m Jack Sloan, a 14 year old 3D Printing Face Shields for Healthcare Workers with Masks For Docs. AMA!
**Hi, I’m Jack Sloan. I’m 14 years old, and I’m one of the youngest people working with** [**Masks For Docs**](https://masksfordocs.com/) **to 3D print** [**face shields**](https://i.imgur.com/w2UGYNv) **for healthcare workers. Across the world, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers helping to keep us safe do not have the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) that they need.**

I’m working with Masks For Docs, a not-for-profit organization working to unite Makers around the world to help supply this critical PPE. We have over 5,000 volunteers across the world utilizing a variety of talents to help aid our healthcare workers, such as 3D Printing, Sewing, Designing, Programming, Logistics, Data management, and much more.

Being one of the youngest people in Masks For Docs has given me an amazing opportunity to demonstrate to other teens that we truly can make a difference ourselves, no matter how we do it. We aren’t simply at the mercy of the adults making the decisions, but we can take responsibility and be a part of this.

Using my 3D printer, I’m able to produce the frame parts which go around your head, and I use binding covers for the clear front parts. These face shields protect healthcare workers by preventing any droplets from hitting their faces. They also help keep N95/surgical masks clean, so that they can be reused more safely.

For a brief explanation of how 3D printing works, you can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LBTkLsjHGQ) or [this one](https://youtu.be/1nKX5Vx9DuY?t=84). I became interested in 3D printing about 2.5 years ago after watching some Youtube videos, and learned that the price has dropped greatly in the past few years, meaning printers have become more affordable for the average consumer (you can get a decent one for as low as $200 now).

I’ve been featured on a variety of shows, such as NBC’s Nightly News, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, Great Big Story, and more, which you can see [here](https://linktr.ee/jacksloan).

**Proof**: You can match [this](https://imgur.com/mAJISge) photo with the printers and setup seen in the previous link with the news segments.

I’m happy to answer any questions you may have, whether they're about Masks For Docs, my experience, 3D printing itself, or anything else. I'll answer as many as I can starting at 2:00 CDT, and I'm also happy to answer any more questions over the next few days when I have a chance.

I'm Brian Muraresku, author of The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion With No Name, an exploration into how psychedelics have played in the origins of Western civilization. AMA
The Immortality Key tracks my 12-year investigation into what the most influential religious scholar of the 20th century, Huston Smith, once referred to as the "best-kept secret" in history. Did the Ancient Greeks use psychedelics to find God? And did the first Christians inherit the same, secret tradition?

I’m Michelle St Clair from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom. I’ve worked in language development and language disorder research for the past 15 years. I now teach typical and atypical language development to our final year students here in the Department of Psychology.
Hi Reddit, My main area of research looks at how difficulties in learning language in early childhood impacts on other areas of children’s development, such as emotional regulation and behavioural difficulties.  We are trying to find out why and how difficulties with language have wider impacts on children’s development. My research group mainly looks at children with Developmental Language Disorder, or a primary problem with understanding and/or using language. These children may have other difficulties as well, such as dyslexia or ADHD. This disorder affects 7.6% of children and often goes undiagnosed. I have written articles to help parents understand when they should be concerned about their child’s language development. 

I have very recently launched a new project to help parents of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD; previously known as SLI or a range of other terms!) and adults with DLD better under the science and the research looking at DLD.  We take important papers and summarise them in a very brief and easy to understand format. We also give parents the links to the papers, so they can read the paper themselves if they wish. We hope this will help parents better understand how they can best help and support their children with DLD.  We also link these parents and adults with research possibilities – if we can help improve our understanding of DLD through research, we will be able to get improved treatments, which will lead to better outcomes for children and young people with DLD. The project is called Engage with Development Language Disorder or E-DLD for short! 

Although I currently focus on children with atypical language development, I do know a lot about how children go about the process of acquiring language without any problems!  Please ask me anything about language development.

Since [my first AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gx5w65/i_am_a_19_year_old_artisan_baker_from_south/) a few months ago, quite a few thing have happened. 

For one, I turned 20! But perhaps more importantly my [first Sourdough Course &amp; Cookbook](https://www.udemy.com/course/achievesourdoughmastery/?couponCode=BAKESOURDOUGH) launched and to date has allowed me to share my love of Sourdough Baking with over 500 students across Udemy &amp; Skillshare. A [few articles](https://mashable.com/shopping/aug-18-sourdough-bread-and-pastry-course-sale/) were also written about my course, one even made it in my [local newspaper](https://imgur.com/a/0E2NrID) which was incredibly humbling to experience.

Since then I've been hard at work on my new Course &amp; Cookbook, this time on making [**Pastries &amp; Desserts using Sourdough Starter! It just recently released!**](https://www.udemy.com/course/artisan-pastry-for-beginners/?couponCode=LEARNPASTRY)

It's been a lot of fun learning new things with these recipes which at first were completely out of my comfort zone, as well as taking the lessons learnt from my first course and using that knowledge to (hopefully) have improved this new one. So with that said, I'd love to share any insights that might be of interest from Sourdough to Baking and even Writing. So AMA!

I am Farrah Alexander, author of Raising the Resistance: A Mother's Guide to Practical Activism. AMA!
Hi Reddit!

I'm Farrah, a writer, mom, activist and the author of my debut book about all of that titled Raising the Resistance: A Mother's Guide to Practical Activism. 

After the election of 2016, I noticed a really passionate resistance against bigotry and injustice forming which was largely being led by women and especially mothers. Also I noticed an influx of mothers becoming engaged in politics and activism for the first time. This continues to be the case as we are living in a historic uprising calling for racial justice and see Black mothers in many cities leading the charge as well as solidarity in groups such as the "Wall of Moms" in Portland and elsewhere. 

Here in my home of Louisville, protests have been raging for months demanding justice for Breonna Taylor and although it's infuriating justice has been denied for so long, this moment feels very different and I think that is palpable throughout the country. 

In my book, I discuss body image, toxic masculinity, feminism, self-care, and antiracism. I also shared some personal anecdotes about running for political office in an attempt to increase representation because women are underrepresented in office. Also, I recounted my experience of nearly dying after childbirth (0/10, would not recommend) and the overarching issue of maternal mortality in the United States. 

This is my debut. Writing and publishing a book has been a lifelong dream fulfilled for me and I'm thrilled to be here. AMA!

My book appears to be sold out pretty much elsewhere, BUT there is actually inventory and if you order, you'll get it in a much quicker and more reasonable timeframe than the expected time given. 

It is available:

What is recklessness during a pandemic? I am an attorney answering questions about wrongful death, recklessness, and negligence surrounding COVID-19. Ask me anything!
Good afternoon Reddit!
I am Texas personal injury attorney [Lin McCraw] (https://mccrawlawgroup.com/about-our-firm/john-l-lin-mccraw/) of The McCraw Law Group. As an accident and injury lawyer, I represent people who have been needlessly endangered, and hold individuals and parties accountable for their negligence. I’m here to answer any questions about rights when someone knowingly transmits COVID-19, employers who are encouraging their employees to come into work when showing COVID-19 symptoms, and how that might relate to reckless endangerment or wrongful death. 

Here is my [proof], (https://www.facebook.com/McCrawLawGroup/posts/2666602710256193), and information on the topic [Family of Tyson employee in Iowa who died of COVID-19 sues company, alleging gross negligence] (https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2020/10/06/tyson-foods-sued-over-columbus-junction-workers-covid-19-death-iowa/3636300001/) - Des Moines Register

I'm Shaun Low, founder of Swords and Stationery which specializes in using tabletop games and gamified lessons to help students with learning difficulties (like dyslexia and ADHD). To date, I have empowered over EIGHTY kids. AMA!
Hey fellow Redditors! My name's Shaun and I founded the world's first game-based educational therapy programme — Swords &amp; Stationery (S&amp;S). We provide intervention for kids and teens with learning challenges (e.g. dyslexia) through a unique curriculum that directly incorporates tabletop games (such as RPGs like Savage Worlds and miniature wargames like Warhammer 40K)

After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Economics in 2012, I joined an NGO as an educational therapist in 2013 (a move that no one could have predicted). During my next four years as a therapist, I started to incorporate tabletop games into my therapy sessions. When I saw the change that these games could effect on the kids, I knew I had to take things one step further.

Thus, I founded Swords &amp; Stationery in 2017. The first two years were rocky, and I mean REALLY rocky. At the beginning of 2018, I only had $0.75 left in the company's bank account. Fortunately, a very lucky and risky gamble paid off, and since then we've managed to not just stay afloat, but also build a near-perfect track record.

So, if any of you have any questions on my journey as an entrepreneur or how I have managed to convince my clients that games are good for their kids, feel free to ask away :D

I’ve been learning under a bespoke shoemaker in the USA! Ask me (or him) anything!
For the past 2.5 weeks I’ve been learning how custom dress shoes are made from bespoke shoemaker. He’s nearing 70 and at one point made shoes for then President Obama (a letter of thanks from whom hangs proudly in his shop).

No computers are used and we’re doing everything by hand or through some very old machines! Masking tape, hammer and nails, colored pencils, and a sharp knife have been my computer and mouse. It’s definitely been a new experience.

While we’re waiting on the heel counters to dry and while he’s working on some repairs I wanted to ask if anyone had any questions! Anything for him I’ll ask and reply with his response.

I am Fred Haight and since the pandemic began in March, I've written over 200 posts on the blog the “Daily Dose Of Beethoven”. And now I'm here to talk about a 24-hour Beethoven livestream for his 250th birthday! AMA!
Hi Reddit! My name is Fred Haight, I'm a musicologist &amp; historian for over 30 years. Since the start of the pandemic in March, [I've written over 200 pedagogical posts about Beethoven and his work](https://www.ffrcc.org/daily-dose-of-beethoven)

This year, Ludwig van Beethoven turns 250. Instead of letting it be overshadowed by the pandemic, I’m part of a 24-hour celebration that takes place on Wednesday, December 16, 2020–on Beethoven’s exact 250th birthday.

That’s right! [For a full 24-hours, starting at midnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyjWFntIiiY&amp;ab_channel=FoundationForTheRevivalOfClassicalCulture), artists and people from all over the world will send greetings, video tributes of various types; and mostly, perform his glorious music—all in celebration of Beethoven’s mind and artistic vision.

Everyone is invited to the party! In that way, all around the planet, on December 16, Beethoven’s voice rings out, loudly and clearly, across the whole universe of human experience. In this way, music can overpower and even swallow up the tones of division and discord that seek to divide us. In that way, we celebrate the fact that “Allen menschen werden brüder”, “all men shall be brothers.”

I am Michelle Burrows, civil rights attorney who has spent the last 30 years suing police and prisons for abuse of force and the mistreatment of people.
Hi everyone. I'm Michelle Burrows, a civil rights attorney based out of Portland, Oregon. I've spent the last 30 years suing police, police departments, and the prison systems for widespread abuse of people and misuse of power. 

I'm well known for cases like Anstett v. State of Oregon, a prisoner class action for the non-treatment of Hepatitis C in the Oregon prison system. As a result, we entered into a stipulated agreement which enforced new standards and protocols for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Hep C in the prison systems. The outcome also included a multi-year monitoring system with a federal supervisory judge to verify that the parties followed through. 

Another important landmark case for Oregon was Kaady v. City of Sandy and Clackamas County. Where two officers tazed and shot Mr. Fouad Kaady in the back multiple times while he was naked, covered in third degree burns, and looking for help after his car caught fire through mechanical failure. The law firm of Gerry Spence approached me to be local council where we won a substantial settlement and were able to change the scope of what constitutes lethal force in Oregon. This case was fundamental in classifying tazers as lethal force in the state of Oregon and was instrumental in changing public perception of use-of-force in Oregon.  

More recently I represented Lisa Dunn v. City of Eugene for systematic rape, abuse, and kidnapping by an on duty police officer over the course of five years. The city police department ignored the indiscretions and allowed the abuse to continue unchecked. We sued and won. The officer was sentenced to 90 years and Lisa was monetarily compensated, although that won't make up for years of abuse. 

My son is helping me with this AMA because I don't know how to use the internet.

Thank you for letting me be a part of your community for the day. I'll check back in over the next few days to see if anything new needs answered.

Financial gain or public health risk? We are Andrew Jack, the Financial Times’s global education editor, and Emma Jacobs, an FT work and careers columnist, AMA about how schools will reopen this autumn.
School closures due to the pandemic have [expanded inequality among both children](https://www.ft.com/content/3084e0e4-c5ce-45ab-bcea-1480726fbdb8) and parents, our work and careers columnist Emma Jacobs reported in June. While kids may suffer permanent damage from long periods without schooling, mothers are more likely to have quit or lost their jobs during the pandemic. 

To get kids back in the classroom, and alleviate economic pain, some countries have already sent students back to school, though administrators have quickly run into roadblocks. Israel saw a [surge in Covid-19 infections](https://www.ft.com/content/224fa625-657c-4ffb-a6a0-a40e04d685b9) after sending students back to class in May. Some US high schools have opened their doors, only to close them or send students home to quarantine within hours or days after finding positive cases within the population. 

Universities are facing their own challenges. The University of North Carolina shifted to online-only classes after the positivity rate among students [soared to 13.6 per cent](https://www.ft.com/content/4a8cff4d-ebfc-335f-a5de-7b1732e35538#post-53381) one week after students reported to campus. With the shift to online learning at UNC and elsewhere, schools have been [pressured to cut fees](https://www.ft.com/content/41bdaca1-1988-4fac-9204-4ff4e70b36cc). Across the globe [schools are reforming curriculums](https://www.ft.com/content/c86be16d-004d-408f-8af8-464ea0bb8832) to adapt to a new reality, but [concerns are mounting](https://www.ft.com/content/77924b49-3e45-447d-b6ca-5acb375b377b) that efforts to mitigate the impact of the virus aren’t enough, writes our global education editor, Andrew Jack.

This is a topic that has befuddled teachers, school administrators, parents and public health experts alike. Emma and Andrew will be here to answer your questions about the impact of the pandemic on education: from gender equality and parenting to transmission risks and possible mitigation strategies.

IamA 31 year old male who just found he has testicular cancer, PICS INCLUDED AMA!
I'll keep it short, but not too short; don't want to leave you hanging.

When I was younger, say around 15-16 I went to the doctor about my enlarged left ball. He said I had vericose veins, which he basically described as the veins you see on the back of olds people's calves; but in my ball. So I took that news and ran with it for the next 15 years!

Anytime my ball was big or would hurt, I would just blame the golden girls for the veiny enlarged ball. Recently my left nut has started to hurt something fierce. It's much tender to the touch, it's got a lot bigger and the testicle feels like a rock. The right feels like that squishy easter candy no one likes but the left feels hard puddy that's starting to dry out.

Well I finally skipped the family doctor and went to a urologist. The guy told me to drop trou and inspected my deformed family jewels. He told me it wasn't vericose veins and I needed a sonogram ASAP.

Well I went and got my sonogram, pictures below. Went back, doctor looked at them and said he wanted additional tests. Apparently testi cancer can spread to your lungs. So got CT scan on nether region, X-Ray on chest and blood test to test for cancer markers. Well yesterday I went in for the results. Chest is clear! Whew. It's contained in my left nut! Whew. However old lefty does indeed have the cancer and is going to leave me in a week.

I hope this posts inspires at least one guy to go to a urologist and get his large ball checked out that he thought was just veins for the last 15 years.

TLDR; thought left nut had veins, turns out it was cancer

I’m John O’Leary, once expected to die, today I teach others how to truly live. I hid my story for 20 years, until I saw the hope it provided others. Today, I’m a speaker, bestselling author and host of the Live Inspired Podcast. My new book IN AWE is out now!
You can’t always choose the path you walk in life, but you can always choose the manner in which you walk it. I live by this mantra and am well versed at managing emotional health during times of crisis (from my own journey, time as a hospital chaplain, and 1-to-1 conversations after 12 years of book signing lines after events). I’m told time and again that my perspective and story gives others hope and strength to own their stories. It humbles me and it’s the reason I do what I do. 
 

I am here on reddit for this AMA today for you! What’s life look like right now? I’d love to share my insight and perspective on overcoming challenges to support you in remembering that your best days are in front of you. I’m also happy to share what it’s like as a keynote speaker grounded from travel during the pandemic, what it’s like to host a podcast, be a father of four, have life-long scars and disabilities from a childhood experience, write books – and specifically my new book IN AWE which I wrote to remind us of the power in seeing the world as our younger selves… OR anything else that comes up!
 
This is YOUR day. Ask me anything.

PS:  to learn more and take a 21-day challenge, check out my site at www.ReadInAwe.com   ...  I'll see you there!

I worked as an Oregon gas attendant both the day and night shifts. I Know this might be a less interesting topic for this reddit but Ive seen some crazy stuff so AMA.
I worked at a Chevron gas station during the graveyard shift and 6 months at an AM/PM more on that later.

Having my gas station be right off the highway and right next to a sports bar I have seen almost every type of personality the town had to offer. But more often than not they ended up being very unpleasant. But on the plus side I have stories ranging from a gentlemen who is going to die in 7 minutes and needs an out of county hospital to a man who made sure I was entirely and absolutely on board with his financial stock decisions or finding some cocaine in money.

you know just another normal day of working the graveyard shifts.

On the day shift of things, I didn't quite experience the crazy and out of whack things that happened during my days working graveyard but during the day shift I learned the art of making tips, and creating better social skills. But the highlight of some of my days working the day-shift were the low end exotics and classic vehicles that would come in on every other occasion. And you might be thinking right now nothing sounds that interesting but let me tell you that I have been tipped some of the weirdest things ranging from a broken down Xbox 360 to a Speed bike and I have also seen things that genuinely worried or disturbed me.

So with all this stuff that I have seen I wanted to find somewhere I could share these crazy stories and events and this sub-reddit seemed like a nice fit. but we will see about that once this goes live now wont we.

So now I will throw out my proof with the two parts of my W-2's that I am comfortable with the whole wide web seeing. I have also submitted a private proofs to the mods and I got a verification notice so I think Im safe posting this.

Here is my approval status

This will be my first post here and I can only hope that I have taken all the proper steps into posting the proper amounts of proof and hopefully providing enough information to have anyone reading this asking a question or two.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I pumped gas and saw some crazy shit and the day shift was on a different spectrum of weird. So AMA about anything you think might have happened or you feel relevant. Ill hopefully be answering as many or little questions that may arrive as soon as I can.

Obligatory edit : I am so happy that so many people had questions to ask me and all of the positivity so far, I will continue to answer questions as I see them pop up. I hope everyone continues to pour in as this has been the highlight of my day so far.

IamA 37 year old male who survived a stroke caused by "enigma" blood clot while living just outside Downtown Los Angeles on Dec 9, one day after returning from several days at Disney World. AMA!
**My short bio:** I thought it would be fun to give some insight about my experience, including having a Near Death Experience in the emergency room while I was stroking out, and becoming initially fully paralyzed from the neck down and having to relearn how to walk and even for that matter basic functions... I'm not sure what i can provide for proof so here is a couple pics from Disney world and then one of me and my mom a week after it happened

**My Proof:** https://imgur.com/gallery/cKFNfv3

EDIT: There was a woman across the hall from my first hospital room who was coughing so badly she sounded like she was drowning. I am mentioning this bc the hospital was in my neighborhood near Macarthur Park. So it's possible she was also from my neighborhood, meaning it may have been in that area as early as December and also I may have accidentally infected Disney World :/

I Hunt Medical Serial Killers. Ask Me Anything.
Dr. Michael Swango is one of the prolific medical serial killers in history. He murdered a number of our nations heroes in Veterans hospitals.  On August 16, HLN (CNN Headline News) aired the show Very Scary People - Dr Death, detailing the investigation and conviction of this doctor based largely upon my book Behind The Murder Curtain.  It will continue to air on HLN throughout the week.

The story is nothing short of terrifying and almost unbelievable, about a member of the medical profession murdering patients since his time in medical school.  

Ask me anything!
