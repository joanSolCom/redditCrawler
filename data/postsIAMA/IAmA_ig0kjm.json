I've tried lots of different methods like David Allen's 'Gettings Things Done' (GTD), Francesco Cirillo's 'Pomodoro technique', as well as the famous 'Eisenhower Matrix'.\n\nThese are all excellent systems, but the thing which has worked best for me is a concept called 'Timeboxing'...and that's what Llama is based on.\n\nI started working on Llama early in 2020, around the time Covid-19 hit. I had just wound up a previous startup and was going through a bit of a tough time, in which I realised there was a large correlation between my happiness and how productive I was during the day. It's extremely important for me to feel like I've accomplished something or contributed to something, and unfortunately some days I just didn't feel that.\n\nDuring this time, I had also been learning to code, and had set myself a challenge to both design and develop a product completely from scratch. So it seemed like the perfect opportunity to channel my energy into making a productivity tool, and I'm proud to say the result is 'Llama'.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about Llama or my coding journey! AMA :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedited: for proof",
