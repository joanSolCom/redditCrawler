        "selftext": "Hi Reddit! My name is Morgan, and I've had two heart transplants and Stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I am 27 years old.\n\nI was born with about 9 congenital heart defects that made it impossible for my heart to work on its own, so in 1993 at the age of 6 months old, I got my first heart transplant at the Colorado Children's Hospital. Little did the doctors know that that first transplanted heart was defective as well, and eventually failed. When I was about 11 years old, in 2004, I collapsed in the hallways of my elementary school and was rushed to the hospital with heart failure. I got my second heart transplant that year, and it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. But it saved my life, and I got to go back to school and be a relatively healthy kid until the summer of 2012.\n\nThat's when I started getting night sweats, chills, and fever. Being a particularly stubborn person, I ignored the symptoms thinking it was the flu and that it would pass. Finally, when I could barely stand, I went to my family doctor who immediately sent me to the ER. Two weeks later (after being diagnosed with everything from West Nile Virus to Mono), the doctors found a series of tumors on my heart and spine. The tumors were inoperable, so I went through 9 rounds of chemo in the fall of 2012 / spring of 2013. In April of 2013 there was no more tumors to be seen, and I continued my college education that I had started in 2011.\n\nNowadays, I deal with a lot of the consequences of my transplants and cancer, but the health effects haven't stopped me from pursuing my dream - becoming a licensed counselor so that I can help others through traumatic and life-changing experiences like mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/TiP75ac](https://imgur.com/a/TiP75ac)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/o6tRmFe](https://imgur.com/a/o6tRmFe)",
