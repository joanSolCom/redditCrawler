I truly love helping others--in fact, I’ve found I tget bored working on anything that doesn’t! \n\nMy hope is to add support to Congress’s biggest ideas: Universal Basic Income, Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and a Homes Guarantee, along with Immigration and Campaign Finance reform. Yes, these are several massive ideas. However unlike my opponent, who is backed by almost a million dollars from corporate PACs and large donors, I do not plan on entering Congress only to offer a million tiny non-solutions. \n\nI want to fight for the massive changes that will build our nation a foundation for a stable, healthy future. I want to fix the financial, medical, and housing insecurities that I saw growing up. I want to heal the anxiety that comes from knowing one small decision, one unexpected event can lead some families to a lifetime of crushing debt and struggle. \n\nYes, it sounds like a lot, and maybe it sounds overly serious to you. But you know what, the past few years have proven that government should be serious. And compassionate. And human. \n\nSpeaking of, included here is a picture that proves I *am* human https://i.imgur.com/Z6q0i82.jpeg. So, without further ado…\n\n\n\nAsk me anything!\n\nP.S.
