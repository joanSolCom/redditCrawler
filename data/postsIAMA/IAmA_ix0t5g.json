I don’t work in a “wet lab” with test tubes, pipettes, or petri dishes. Instead, I help make [software to solve problems for biology and medical researchers]( https://www.dnastar.com/workflows/protein/). My work focuses on scientific topics like [predicting the shape of a protein’s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence]( https://www.dnastar.com/blog/structural-biology/why-structure-prediction-matters/), predicting how two or more proteins bind to one another, designing amino acid sequences that bind more tightly to a target, and applying all of these topics together to make better therapeutic molecules.\nDo you have scientific, business, or career questions about computational biology or how it affects our lives? AMA! I’ll do my best to answer them.\n\nProof: [Blog post](https://www.dnastar.com/blog/events/ask-a-structural-bioinformatician-anything/), [Photo](https://www.dnastar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AMA-Steve-DNASTAR-600.jpg)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Steve will be answering from his account, /u/Steve-DNASTAR\n\nEdit 2: It's 1:30 PM CDT and Steve is still working to answer your questions.
