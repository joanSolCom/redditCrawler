We’re the founders of Fix The Mask, a non-profit organization dedicated to quickly supplying better masks in the fight against COVID-19. \n\nSince the start of this pandemic, we’ve watched vulnerable communities across the globe suffer from the lack of proper protection. With a shortage of N95 masks, many lives and families have been put at risk. We couldn’t just sit back and let this happen, so we took matters into our own hands. \n\nWith the help of engineers across the country, we’ve deconstructed the N95 mask to find out how we can reconstruct a good mask, faster. We learned that for every 1 N95 mask made, over 300 surgical masks are made. Similar to N95 masks, ATSM-level surgical masks are made of the same material stack-up, and are tested to filter out 95% of COVID-19 particles. However, they lack the tight seal that N95s have. That’s where rubber bands come in. Using only 3 rubber bands, we’ve created a tight seal for surgical masks, creating a DIY Surgical Mask brace.\n (How-to make the brace https://youtu.be/CVjGCPfRwUo)\n\nIn addition to the DIY rubber band method, we’ve also engineered and published a more sophisticated Open Source Mask Brace Design—so that anyone in the world can make it at scale. Anyone with a rubber sheet and scissors will be able to create a comfortable, easy-to-clean, reusable brace. In addition, we are partnering with different manufacturers to bring these to the world, at scale.\n\nOur mission is to supply safe mask solutions, quickly—to everyone. That includes more vulnerable communities like developing nations. We’ve been working side by side with doctors across the globe who need help protecting those who need it most. \n\nWe’re here to help in the fight against COVID-19. We hope that sharing these brace designs will help anyone in need, including essential workers and vulnerable communities, to take the necessary measures to protect themselves and their families. \n\nTo learn more about Fix The Mask go to www.fixthemask.com.\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/eiddgx5ecvv41.jpg\n\nAsk us anything! We’ll be here at 1pm PST answering your questions.",
