Together we wrote a book called How To Drink Wine. It's not a book that's going to make you an immediate expert, but we wrote it to help you understand enough to begin to incorporate wine into your life.\n \nHow To Drink Wine is about the 29 wines you’re most likely to come across out in the world. From how wine is made, to whether or not it really needs to “breathe.\" It's meant to be relatable and entertaining and not teach you anything about a grape you've probably never heard of called Grechetto. That said, if you already do enjoy having high level discussions about obscure grapes from Italy, I have a feeling you’ll like this book too.  How To Drink Wine comes out May 12th and all the info on how to get it is here: https://www.theinfatuation.com/features/how-to-drink-wine-chris-stang. We also have a weekly newsletter for wine, if you're into that too: http://theinfatuation.com/winenewsletter\n \nWe're here to answer any questions you have about wine, what you're supposed to (and not supposed to) do when you drink it. No question is too dumb or too obscure - but we have the right to change our mind on that. Ask away!\n\n\nProof: \n\n - https://i.redd.it/8q4xkkc2vtw41.jpg\n - https://i.redd.it/52vqvht0vtw41.jpg",
