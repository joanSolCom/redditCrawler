Sign up for our EFFector newsletter to stay in touch with us and to know more about our work: https://www.eff.org/effector\n\n////\n\nWe are lawyers, activists, technologists and lobbyists at [the Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world. We champion user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development. We work to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows.\n \nBut recently, Members of Congress have mounted a major threat to your freedom of speech and privacy online. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) recently introduced a bill that would undermine key protections for Internet speech in U.S. law. It would also expose providers of the private messaging services we all rely on to serious legal risk, potentially forcing them to undermine their tools’ security.\n \nThe so-called [EARN IT Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-act-violates-constitution) ( [S. 3398](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3398/BILLS-116s3398is.pdf) ) is an attack on speech, security, and innovation. [Congress must reject it](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill).\n \nJoin us to discuss the ways that the EARN IT Act would be a disaster for Internet users’ free speech and security.
