I spent six months training while finishing high school exams and then missed my graduation to go the very far west of Mongolia to begin the walk. I was 18 at the time.\n\nWe were supported by a local Kazakh support team and 14 camels. The team started with 12 but by the time we finished 2 months later, there were 4 of us who completed the entire walk on foot.\n\nWhile on the expedition, I became close friends with some local nomads and ended up living with them for three months the following winter. I then flew out a nomad to come live with me in Hong Kong for a month. That was an incredible experience.\n\nSince then, I've completed a number of expeditions around the world - where possible, to raise funds and awareness for causes close to me. I also go back to Mongolia every year or so to spend time with my nomadic friends as a kind of break from the world and technology.\n\nI believe that expeditions that challenge us mentally and physically put colour in our everyday lives and it is an experience we should all go through.\n\nAMA!\n\nP.S.
