The series was inspired by a dream I had when I was 12. I published the first book, *Inner Sanctum: Reality,* when I was 18, and I published the second book, *Inner Sanctum: Rise,* when I was 20 just before I started college.\n\n2) I am also an electronic musician who released my first album two years ago. I have recently released several singles, the first of which has received 14K views on YouTube (not a million, but it was my first single under my new alias, which in my opinion isn't too bad). I also sing, play the piano and beatbox. I come from an evangelistic family and am a part of my dad's music ministry (I sing harmony). \n\n3) I am currently studying graphic design. I've done a lot of design work for my personal projects, particularly with my music. I did some design work for a record label and for other electronic musicians. Prior to the shutdown I was working at a co-op doing graphic design work. I got a call from my boss saying that he'd like me back, even though our co-op session was over for the year!
