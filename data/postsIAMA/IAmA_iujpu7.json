It focuses on a variety of actors engaging in protests and counter-protests, on questions of framing and re-framing protests and agendas as well as on reaction and reflection of social upheaval. By asking questions about language, effectiveness of protests and the role of so-called moderates, the panelists present a historical perspective on subjects that are evermore present and urgent in this very age.\n\n#[Click through here for the AMA with the panelists](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iui1ea/being_the_change_that_others_dont_want_asserting/)\n\n&gt; Moderated by **Johannes Breit** (/u/commiespaceinvader), this panel features:\n&gt; \n&gt; **Tyler Wentzell** (/u/tdwentzell), presenting his paper, **“Fascists in Hogtown: Toronto’s Reaction and Resistance to the National Unity Party during the Summer of 1938”**.\n&gt; \n&gt; *For most of the Great Depression, Canada’s fascist parties were small, marginal, and disunited.  While the Parti National Social Chrétien had achieved a public presence in Montreal, similar organizations on the west coast, the prairies, and Ontario were small in membership and influence.  They mostly lurked about in secret meetings in members’ homes.  This changed in the summer of 1938 with the establishment of a National Unity Party (NUP).  The NUP united the disparate nationalist parties; openly recruited soldiers, ex-soldiers, and police; and held a public rally at one of Toronto’s largest venues: Massey Hall.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *This paper examines how Torontonians reacted to the “arrival” of the NUP that summer.  Specifically, it examines the tactics employed by a disparate anti-fascist movement, how city officials publicly responded to the free speech debate, and how some members of the local militia and police openly supported the NUP.  Drawing upon personal papers, organizational records of the resisters, legal records, and newspaper accounts, this paper concludes that while many vocal Torontonians were vocally opposed to the NUP, the majority were indifferent or even supportive of its stated objectives.*\n&gt; \n&gt; **​Ryan Abt** (/u/kugelfang52), presenting his paper, **“Everyone I Don’t Like is Hitler: The Appropriation of Anti-Nazi Axioms by American Fascists, 1944–1949”**.\n&gt; \n&gt; *In the 1930s and early 1940s, American educators perceived group hatreds as a significant danger when facing the growth of Nazism. They believed that the Nazis succeeded in coming to power and in conquering enemies through “divide and conquer” techniques. These methods fostered group antagonisms, which weakened the Nazis’ enemies. In response, educators seized upon intercultural and unity education to defeat the subversive effects of what they saw as imported “Nazi racial ideology.” These efforts found significant purchase in educational curricula between 1933 and 1945.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *By the end of the war, however, organizations, which such educational initiatives had denounced, due to either their embrace of fascism or demagogic intolerance, began to use calls for unity to silence progressive educators. Decrying charges of bigotry as divisive, conservative educators depicted intercultural education as communist “divide and conquer” subversion. They, thereby, reoriented Americans’ understandings of Nazism by focusing on the methods of totalitarianism and ignoring its specific ideological components. This realignment submerged the racial components of the Nazi atrocities and silenced efforts at drawing parallels and lessons in U.S. society.*\n&gt; \n&gt; ​**Dr. Megan Hunt** (/u/Dr_Megan_Hunt), presenting her paper, **“Bringing the Millennium to Birmingham: To Kill a Mockingbird and Racial Protest in Alabama’s Magic City”**.\n&gt; ​\n&gt; *On April 3, 1963, residents of Birmingham, Alabama woke to triumphant newspaper reports of “a new day” penned by mayor-elect, Albert Boutwell. Touting himself as a moderate, Boutwell was a segregationist: unlikely “to bring the millennium to Birmingham”, according to Martin Luther King, Jr. For the city’s Black population, barred from downtown employment, this “new day” signified “business as usual”. Boutwell celebrated his victory immediately, at the city’s segregated premiere of* To Kill a Mockingbird. *Across town, and willfully ignored by those at the premiere, April 3, 1963 marked the beginning of “Project X” a consolidated effort to draw attention to the city’s entrenched racism as part of a national push for civil rights legislation. Images of city police violently confronting young protestors would cement the city’s reputation for racial hatred and brutality, but ultimately force President Kennedy to acknowledge civil rights as a “moral issue”.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *This paper argues that the election, premiere, and Project X offer a composite image of the city’s culture and self-image as it entered a defining era of “chaos, revolution, and change”. April 3, 1963 afforded glamour and celebration for some, as other residents began to storm the barricades of a segregated citadel. The Magic City, as inhabited and imagined by each group, could not have been more different.*\n\n&gt;Find more of today's conference content [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iugiah/megathread_its_the_final_day_of_the_askhistorians/).\n\n&gt;Learn more about the AskHistorians 2020 Digital Conference [here](https://www.askhistorians.com/2020-digital-conference).",
