I am a software engineer by trade but have always been passionate about politics and have volunteered on campaigns often since first going door to door with my parents canvassing in 1984.  I have been a supporter of open source software throughout my career having created the [SymphonyOS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Symphony_OS) Linux distribution in 2004.  I've worked both for local companies in web development and for global companies having first joined DigitalOcean as one of the first twenty employees and helped in it's growth to nearly 700 people when I left and now working in Developer Relations at MongoDB as a remote employee helping to build community and promote education in tech.\n\nIn 2018 I spent most weekends leading up to the election driving the Democratic candidate for this seat as she canvassed across Dubuque County.  This year I was concerned as the primary season went by without a Democratic candidate stepping up and in August I reached out to friends with the county party to learn how I could help us win back this seat.  \n\nI was told that the party had not been able to find a candidate despite this district having more registered Democrats than Republicans and it having been a Democratic district prior to the current incumbent's two terms.  Most candidates for public office spend months making a decision and putting things in motion but I was told that the special nomination convention would be in just two days.  Having the passion and ability to seek this office and knowing the alternative would be an uncontested seat I felt compelled to step up.  I spoke with my wife and kids and before the end of the week I was the nominee for Iowa House District 57.\n\nSince kicking off my campaign in mid August I have found a great group of volunteers, found support from my friends and co-workers and benefited from the assistance of other local Democratic legislators and the county party.  Starting from zero we now have over 200 yard signs out around the county, delivered a direct mail piece to all 3550 Democratic and No Party households voting absentee and placed door hangers at another 2000 homes.  Without direct support from the state party or large PACs we created radio and video ads in-house which are now running on five local radio stations and on YouTube and Facebook.  \n\nWhile this race is an uphill battle it is winnable!  District 57 includes most of Dubuque County outside the city and consists of rural areas, small towns and suburbs.  With factories, farms and tourist attractions the district is a microcosm of Iowa.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by a couple hundred with a large contingent of No Party voters.  \n\nThe key issues that are important to me are:\n\n- Fully funding our public schools and returning Iowa schools to being the best in the nation.\n\n- Fighting for working families by supporting a fair minimum wage and making sure that agencies tasked with ensuring safe workplaces are properly funded.\n\n- Ensuring affordable and accessible healthcare including mental health services and reversing the GOPs disastrous experiment in the privatization of our Medicaid program.\n\n- Restoring the collective bargaining rights of our teachers and all state employees.\n\n\nYou can learn more about me at:\n\n[My Website](https://quinnforiowa.com)\n\n[On Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quinnforiowa)\n\n[On Twitter](https://twitter.com/IowaQuinn)\n\nAnd you can help us to flip District 57 and the Iowa House as a whole by donating.  Your donation up to $5000 will be matched by The Dubuque County Democratic Party Central Committee!\n\n[Donate Here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/q4i)\n____________________________________\n\n[EDIT: AMA HAS CONCLUDED.
