I have long been interested in the American Civil War, and am President of the American Civil War Round Table UK.\n&gt; \n&gt; The American Civil War is often said to have predicted the way in which later wars such as the Boer War and the First World War would be fought. As a result, the British Army has been criticised for not heeding its lessons. My recently published book *Bull Run to Boer War: How the American Civil War Changed the British Army* challenges that long-held view, suggesting that it really derives from British criticism of the Army’s performance in the First World War. I believe that the responses to the lessons of the war in the British Army were more complex, better informed, and of higher quality, than normally depicted. Key to this new interpretation is that it takes a 19th century perspective rather than pre-supposing what the British should have seen based upon hindsight from the South African veldt or the Western Front trenches. There were substantial changes in technology, tactics, and strategy during the Victorian period, all influenced to some extent by study of the American Civil War.\n&gt; \n&gt; I’m available today (27 June 2020) from 13.00 to 18.00 UTC to answer any questions you may have about how the American Civil War influenced military thought in Britain prior to the Boer War.\n&gt;",
