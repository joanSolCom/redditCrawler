Let me start by talking about how [MemePAC](https://memepac.org) came about.\n\nIn late July, I looked for ways to do my part to rid the country of a man that has downplayed COVID-19, threatened democracy, and furthered divisions within our country. In addition to going against Rudy Giuliani, I also wanted to unseat Donald Trump.\n\nInspired by the Lincoln Project, I decided to create MemePAC as a Super Political Action Committee with the FEC and starting making content to release on TikTok. Unlike other Super PACs, MemePAC created alternative content like online tools/games. For example, we created a parody of Tinder but from the POV of Trump and a service that texts/emails you daily memes about Trump's atrocities.\n\nFor the first few months, MemePAC's views were growing consistently but slowly. However, after releasing our Among Us-themed video where \"for every person that follows us on TikTok, Trump gets ejected,\" our following grew from 4,000 to 300,000 on TikTok almost overnight.\n\nWith our growing success, we started getting covered by networks such as the New York Times, The Hill, Fox Business, and even Good Morning America. But I think the most exciting coverage was Know Your Meme. It was always my dream to leave a mark on meme history and I finally did it!\n\nAt this point, it's pretty clear that Joe Biden has won. As such, MemePAC is looking to shift its focus onto issues/elections that align with our values (which are pretty close to the consensus of the democratic party). For one, we're trying to help Ossoff and Warnock win, effectively flipping the Senate blue.\n\n**Anyways AMA!**\n\nAlso, we're looking for some new team members, whether you're a comedian, memer, programmer, researcher, or just someone who wants to see change in Capitol Hill — email me at [recruitment@memepac.org](mailto:recruitment@memepac.org).\n\nSome links about us:\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/memepac-demolishing-trump-tiktok-2020-10\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/style/tiktok-election-night.html\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/technology/524048-teens-turn-to-tiktok-to-boost-biden\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/gen-z-politicos-use-tiktok-memes-to-target-young-voters\nhttps://www.mic.com/p/meet-the-teen-behind-the-super-pac-trolling-trump-with-memes-41056939\nhttps://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/memepac",
