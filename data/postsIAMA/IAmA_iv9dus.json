I went to Action Park as a kid and have spent the past decade chasing my memories and trying to understand if the chaotic, anarchic, strange, dangerous, fun, terrifying, dangerous, violent place in my head could possibly have been real. Prior to Class Action Park, I worked with some friends in 2013 on a separate short documentary about Action Park (\"The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever\") and appeared in a few dozen episodes of Travel's \"Mysteries at the Museum\" telling fun stories from history. I'm also a journalist and former magazine editor. Ask me anything about Class Action Park, Action Park, theme parks, pinball... or anything else. And say hi on Twitter: @sethporges.\n\nChris Charles Scott: Hi all! I co-directed and produced Class Action Park. I had never heard of Action Park until my friend Seth told me about this strange and insane amusement park and I couldn't believe it was real. Turns out, it was—and I was instantly obsessed. Ask me anything about Action Park, Class Action Park, or college football and I'll answer from beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\nEd Youmans: I’ve worked in ski area management most of my life, working in New Jersey, Lake Tahoe, Oregon, and Colorado. These days I’m the general manager of a ski resort in Western, NY. I worked at Action Park from 1985 to 1995. I began there as a Ride Attendant and spent the last 5 years there as the Resort Operations Manager. I was immediately interested in contributing to this film mostly because I saw Seth’s mashable.com video on Action Park in 2012 and thought he did a better job than anyone ever had at painting a picture of what Action Park was all about. When I heard he was doing a feature-length film I thought “he’s the right one to tell the whole story”. After 10 years at Action Park, I was more or less burned out and at least a little “post-traumatic” - so I moved to Lake Tahoe and spent a couple of years rock climbing in Yosemite to decompress.\n\n[Watch the wild ride of a trailer here](https://www.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GX0P9SwLUP4vDIQEAAAAe).\n\n\nProof: \n\n - https://i.redd.it/h3dvwdxjetn51.jpg\n - https://i.redd.it/1j88xl6metn51.jpg\n - https://i.redd.it/f7tcvafoetn51.jpg\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the great questions!
