But a majority of Americans also say the justice system is not harsh enough. How do we reconcile these two, often competing, goals? \n\nWe’re reporters who’ve spent eight months producing a podcast that challenges what we think we know about the U.S. criminal justice system. Over six episodes, we take on questions like the one above, as well as: Is it true that most people in American jails have not been convicted of the crime for which they were arrested? Would closing down private prisons really end mass incarceration? And does more immigration really mean more crime? \n\nWe spoke with formerly incarcerated people, reform advocates, a former ICE attorney turned immigration lawyer, crime victims/survivors, researchers. Our goal is to sort out where public opinion and reality don’t align – or, in some cases, where our perceptions contradict each other – when it comes to the criminal justice system. \n\nThe podcast is called [Perception Gaps: Locked Up](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up) – Season 2 of the [series](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps) – and we’re all reporters with [The Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/), an international (and secular – we know, the name) Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization.\n\nAsk us anything!\n\nAbout us:\n\n[Samantha Laine Perfas](https://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Samantha-Laine-Perfas): I’m the Monitor’s Story Team Leader, and I lead the production of our multimedia content. I’m also the host of the Monitor’s [Perception Gaps](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps) podcast and love digging into topics that reveal my own blindspots. Originally from Minnesota, I now live in Boston. I’m [@samlaineperfas](https://twitter.com/samlaineperfas?lang=en) on Twitter, and look forward to hearing your questions! \n\n[Henry Gass](https://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Henry-Gass): I’m a criminal justice reporter based in Austin, Texas. I got started on the criminal justice beat when I covered the Boston Marathon bombing trial in 2015. Since then, I’ve shadowed public defenders, progressive prosecutors, and cops. I’ve covered U.S. Supreme Court cases, tribal courts, and wrongful convictions. This is my debut podcast.

I produce and report (and sometimes host) audio and video stories/series for the paper, and am also a recovering print reporter: I covered the West Coast from California, and then moved to D.C. to cover Capitol Hill, before shifting to my current role.
