For people who affected by eating disorders or other mentally fragile conditions; scrolling through this post might revive your own, painful, memories, so please consider this before reading it. --\n\nHi Reddit! So together with the amazing photographer Mafalda Rakoš (Austrian, 27) I, Ruben de Theije (Dutch, 24), have worked the last 2 years in our free time co-initiating a project about men with eating disorders. Eventually we ended up interviewing and portraying 11 men from Austria, Germany and the Netherlands who were bravely willing to open up about their current or former struggles with anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder or OSFED (Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder). Their stories are collected in a book, A Story to Tell, and in exhibtions throughout Europe.\n\n\\- Some articles about it. [German book review](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG9-Z-HnGI7/) , [GUP Magazine - English](https://gupmagazine.com/interview/mafalda-rakos-a-story-to-tell-or-regarding-male-eating-disorders/) , [Burn Magazine - English](https://www.burnmagazine.org/essays/2020/03/mafalda-rakos-a-story-to-tell/) , [Volkskrant - Dutch](https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/mannen-met-eetstoornissen-zijn-bang-niet-als-mannelijk-gezien-te-worden~b786ad39/) , [RTL Nieuws - Dutch](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/editienl/artikel/5113211/stigma-mannen-eetstoornis-anorexia-boek) , [AD - Dutch](https://www.ad.nl/tilburg/anorexia-alleen-bij-vrouwen-rijsbergenaar-bewijst-tegendeel-met-boek-de-interviews-waren-soms-heel-heftig~a923cf59/) .\n\n\\- About the exhibitions: [Dutch Photomuseum - Rotterdam - English](https://www.nederlandsfotomuseum.nl/en/exhibition/steenbergen-stipendium-2019-eng-2/) , [RTL Nord - Hamburg - German](https://www.rtlnord.de/nachrichten/ausstellung-in-hamburg-maenner-mit-essstoerungen-noch-immer-ein-tabuthema.html) , [Athens Photo Festival - English](https://www.photofestival.gr/exhibitions/mafalda-rakos-3).\n\n\\- [Proof post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6734961331579027456/)\n\n\\- [More info: our website](https://astorytotell.info/#astt_intro)\n\nThis is by the way the second time I post this, but the last one rightfully got deleted after 5 minutes a couple of days ago (I didn't follow the guidelines for providing the proof, sorry my bad). So this is the second try!\n\nSince it's quite a hidden topic I'd like to show Reddit that these issues exist. This is also the reason we started this project. Beforehand, as a small disclaimer: I'm not a psychologist nor mental health professional in general, so some questions about personal situations I will not answer, due to the fact that professionals can provide better help for this. But what I can do is share our findings and summarize the experiences of the protagonists (of which some of them now work as mental health professionals, helping others with recovering from eating disorder). In general, to just give a better understanding about this topic! Which is definitely necessary.\n\nSo shoot: AMA about the project, topic or just life!\n\nEDIT 1: Guys, sorry but after a long day it's sleeping time! Tomorrow I'll wake up a bit earlier to answer some of your questions still, so you can definitely still send them in. I will try to answer as many as possible. Thanks for your interest, question and all the kind words. I didn't expect it to have so many comments and upvotes, so that's really amazing! Have a nice day/night all and take care!\n\nEDIT 2: Thank your for all your questions, I did answer some of them quickly this morning. If you're interested in ordering our book, you can do it on [our website!](https://astorytotell.info/Shop) Unfortunately I'm not able to answer all of the questions, because I have a busy schedule coming up. But if you suffer with personal issues or are worried about people in your environment, please reach out to a professional. They will listen, help and ease the pressure from you. You are not alone in this. Thanks for sharing questions, experiences and kind words. I'm glad the post did what it was meant for! Take care.",
