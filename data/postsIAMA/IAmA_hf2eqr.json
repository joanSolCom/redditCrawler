We need a Senator who is unafraid to fight for progressive ideals. That is why Im running. Im proud to have been the first candidate to sign on to the [Green New Deal pledge](https://www.marquitabradshaw.com/environment) in December of 2019. In the Senate, I will fight for Tennessee to be a leader in the coming Green Economy. With investments in our state, quality high-paying jobs will be accessible from Memphis to Knoxville. We can and must be a leader in this.\n\nWhen this pandemic ends and servers go back to waiting tables, business owners get back to full capacity, and churches are loud with worship, I believe the people of Tennessee will remember who had their back and who fought on their side. I am that candidate &amp; I would love to have your vote on 8/6. Thank you! \n\nDont want to read through our answers but want to get to know Marquita?   \n[Watch this interview I did with the TN Holler!](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=297741791265667&amp;external_log_id=bfca0650-d922-4dd6-818d-1df0868e5c42)\n\nI will be here on 6/24 @ 11CST to answer your questions!\n\n[Donate to our campaign.
