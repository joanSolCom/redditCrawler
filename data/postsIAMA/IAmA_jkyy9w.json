But I’m taking my best shot.\n\nI’m the journalist and senior campaigns and elections editor behind [POLITICO’s Election Forecast](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/race-forecasts-and-predictions/) rating the 538 Electoral College votes to the 435 House districts and everything in between.\n\nHere’s how things are looking this year:\n\n* In the race for the White House, Joe Biden is the favorite as we wrap up the last week of the campaign. There’s still a plausible path for President Trump to win an Electoral College majority – but it has grown much narrower. (Here’s [my field guide from last week](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/22/biden-swing-state-polls-431287) to the recent swing state polls.)\n* The race for Senate control is close to a coin flip. Democrats have built leads in states that were previously considered up for grabs and put new states firmly on the map.\n* In the House, Democrats strengthened their grip as the national environment swung toward them. Our latest ratings place a majority of seats in the Democratic column, even if Republicans win all of the toss-up seats.\n\nThese ratings are the product of a rigorous process, analyzing election results, registration trends, the national political environment, public polling and private survey data. They also reflect conversations with dozens of campaign operatives, pollsters and other sources.\n\nAsk me anything about our election forecast or a specific state or race.\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/politico/status/1321249483968159746](https://twitter.com/politico/status/1321249483968159746)\n\n(Edit: Signing off, but thanks for the great questions!)
