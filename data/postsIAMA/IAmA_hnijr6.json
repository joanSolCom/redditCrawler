Brandon has worked in retail customer service, non-profit work, and on campaigns. Through this work, he has honed the skills of building consensus, and working with people from many different backgrounds, while still not being afraid to stand up for what’s right and speak truth to power.\n\nBrandon believes we need to expand Medicaid in the state of Tennessee. We have the ability to access federal money that’s already been set aside for this purpose, which would help provide healthcare access to over 700,000 of our neighbors and stop the closure of even more rural hospitals. We also need to institute a worker’s bill of rights by introducing a slate of bills related to making sure all Tennesseans have access to a living wage, paid family leave, and a proper work/life balance. And we need to reform our criminal justice system, by ending cash bail and making sure that justice is restorative, not punitive.\n\nBrandon was born and raised here in Rutherford county. He graduated from Smyrna High School and MTSU. Brandon is fighting to create a family-friendly economy that works for everyone. No exceptions. Brandon is ready to fight for his community to ensure access to healthcare, to fight for a family-friendly economy, and to fight for equal treatment under the law. Brandon is ready to bring love and compassion back to our legislature, and get to work solving the problems affecting everyday Tennesseans.\n\nYou can help us flip this seat by going votebrandonthomas.com to sign up to volunteer and to contribute to the campaign.\n\n[AMA goes live at 12:00 EDT](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/hmxdoq/i_am_brandon_thomas_candidate_for_tennessee_state/)",
