        "selftext": "**Background:**\n\nI was voted president of the college republicans for two years in a row, went to CPAC twice, worked in Senator Rick Santorum’s legislative office, worked on his campaign, did door-to-door campaigning in various state and local elections, and registered people to vote. My first vote was for Bush in 2000. My parents still have the picture of me voting up on our wall.\n\nI also used to work in counter-terrorism. [You may remember me from a past AMA I did after the Paris shootings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3t6iog/lets_talk_terrorism_i_am_a_former/) I worked for the City of Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management &amp; Homeland Security where I routinely deployed in support of Pittsburgh SWAT to barricaded suspects, hostage situations, and suspected active shooter events. I also worked as an intelligence analyst in the Region 13 Counter-Terrorism Fusion Center.\n\n**Breaking Point:**\n\nMy breaking point came after the Syria pullout. I called Senator Toomey’s (R-PA) office, got a staffer on the line, and asked him what Toomey’s stance was. I was told that, “the senator disapproves of the pullout.” When I said great, but asked what he was going to do about it, I was flatly told, “Nothing.” *Nothing?* I lost it. A senator’s literal job as defined by the Constitution is to check the balance of the executive branch. If a senator openly admits that he disagrees with a major policy decision like this and does nothing, we have a problem. Toomey, as always, has done zero to check the president’s power. Democracy doesn’t work this way. We’re putting our nation’s system at risk.\n\nThis isn’t the party I joined. A new conservative party is needed, but until then it’s time for moderate conservatives to build bridges with democrats.\n\n**What I’m Doing:**\n\nThe most important thing any disgruntled conservative can do right now is stand up, be vocal, and give other conservatives social permission to deviate from the norm.\n\nWhile still a small side project, I started a social media campaign called [“Conservatives Voting Democrat in 2020”](https://www.facebook.com/CVD2020/) to achieve exactly this (click for verification). I reach about 600 people each week, most of whom are conservative. It’s small work but it’s good work.\n\nThe “us versus them” mentality in the GOP is real and taking a stand can feel like we’re putting our social ties on the chopping block. Yet hiding doesn’t earn respect - honesty does. If you can say what you believe clearly and directly, back it up with sound argument, and stay calm and grounded throughout, you’re good. If our social ties can’t stand the honest truth then we don’t have great relationships to begin with.\n\n**\"But you’re a conservative! Why should conservatives vote democrat?! This makes no sense.\"**\n\nI want change. Because disagreement isn’t allowed in the GOP anymore, I’m pretty much forced to do this. This is why many of us resonate with the phrase, \"republican refugees.\" We're being forced out.\n\nAt the end of the day, the GOP only cares about two things: my money and my vote. I can complain as loud as I want, but if I give them these two things they could care less. Holding my money back won’t do anything; there’s plenty of billionaires to take my place. That leaves me with my vote. If I fall in line and keep voting the way I’ve always voted then I’m only going to get more of the same. I already spent years calling my republican representatives with zero success. This is the only option I have left. It’s the only way to do something that might actually make a difference.\n\n**Why I’m here today:**\n\n1. To answer any questions that could aid in “across the aisle” understanding, and\n2. To connect with other disgruntled \"republican refugees\" and let them know that they’re not alone.\n\nWe are free individuals who are allowed to vote however we please. These are the rights our nation was built on. It’s time to own our democratic power and use it in the ways we see fit.\n\nI’m doing some editing work that requires my attention so I’ll be popping in and out here in bursts, so be patient if questions pile up a bit at times. Thanks.\n\n\\---\n\nResubmitting with new proof: [https://www.facebook.com/CVD2020/posts/162985051887751](https://www.facebook.com/CVD2020/posts/162985051887751)\n\n**EDIT 1: I'm going to be signing off at 6pm EDT. If you come after then, leave a top level comment (I do these via reddit inbox) and I'll do my best to respond over the next few days.
