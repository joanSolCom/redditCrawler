Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_S._Jones), author of *Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All*. I am a professor of history at [Johns Hopkins University](https://history.jhu.edu/directory/martha-jones/), where I teach courses on race and the law, Black womanhood, and the history of women and the vote.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Vanguard* argues that Black women have been the vanguards of democracy – since the earliest days of the republic in movements for women’s rights and abolitionism. While many women celebrated the centennial of the 19th Amendment, I [wrote](https://forward.com/culture/452816/19th-amendment-centennial-not-celebratory-martha-jones/) about the disappointments of the 19th Amendment and how Black women were left behind to fight for several more decades against the disenfranchisement of Jim Crow laws. In my story, the 19th Amendment was a beginning, not an end, for Black women. In the 20th century, the women of *Vanguard*, including Fannie Lou Hamer and Shirley Chisholm, continued the work of voting rights into the civil rights movement and beyond. Today, leaders like Stacey Abrams and Kamala Harris carry this torch, and by their examples, make the case that neither racism not sexism has a place in American politics. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you to the /r/AskHistorians mods for welcoming me for this community conversation.
