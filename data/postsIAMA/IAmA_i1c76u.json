Over the past couple of years the game has grown as it found an ever increasing player base, and the studio expanded with it.\n\nYesterday, we released Onward as one of the first traditional multiplayer First Person Shooter games on the Oculus Quest, and we have big plans for what's next (although we can't talk bout that yet). Today, we kick back a bit and answer all your questions about video game development, running a video game development studio, working with a remote and international team, and our game Onward.\n\nWe also have a few people from our publishing partner Coatsink with us, who will be happy to answer your question about game publishing!  We're starting this AMA at 11AM PDT!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk us anything!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your questions, we've enjoyed reading through them, and unfortunately couldn't answer all of them for various reasons. Be sure to check out Onward on your VR platform, and we hope to hear from you in the future!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof: [https://i.imgur.com/hzSUef4.png](https://i.imgur.com/hzSUef4.png)",
