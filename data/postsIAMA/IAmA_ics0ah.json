You see, if students don't know all their options, or don't understand what they actually need (or **don't** need), they're going to pay too much.\n\nAfter 17 years in the textbook industry, we finally got tired of watching countless students spend way too much money for their class material simply because they don’t understand they have options.  Publishers rely on creating confusion to ensure student’s buy new, high priced items from them instead of lower margin or used items on the web.\n\nAnd the craziest thing of all...students have no idea they’re getting screwed because of textbook complexity.  They know books are expensive, but they say, “I just bought what was on my syllabus.  What’s so complex about that?” \n\nA lot actually, and while you might have what you need for class, you probably overpaid big time.\n\nSo, we decided to do something about it.  We understand that a typical student has no way to become a Textbook Expert, so we created a **free** tool that makes everyone an expert.    Our tool does two things. \n\n1. It puts students back in control by giving them every option for the material they need.  There are more options than they think--even for things like access codes.\n2. It simplifies class material down into its component parts.  Publishers make a ton of money on high priced “packages” that contain more than one item.  We’ve found that if you break that package down into its individual items and just buy what you need, you can save dumb amounts of money. \n\nWe call our free tool PageLess, and you can use it at [www.pageless.us](http://www.pageless.us/)\n\nCurious about the inner workings of the 15 billion dollar textbook industry?  Ask us anything.",
