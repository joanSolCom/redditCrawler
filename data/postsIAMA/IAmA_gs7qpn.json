He is known for being the key Bitcoin core developer who worked under Satoshi Nakamoto for two years. His work can be found in every bitcoin and miner.\n\n[Jeff Dionne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-jeff-dionne-5145629/) is the CEO of [Core Semiconductor](https://www.coresemi.io/). He is known for uClinux, from which most embedded Linux systems are derived, and developing many other game-changing embedded systems hardware and software technologies.  \n\nJeff Dionne and I have always been passionate about pushing the boundaries of space and blockchain applications; a few of the past projects we have worked on are Linux kernel and Bitcoin Core.  We’ll love to share with you our experiences being in our respective industries, such as the formation of the open source industry, open hardware, fabless semiconductor development, nano-satellites, cryptocurrency, and more.\n\nWe'd also love to discuss our development for our latest project –  an open-source hardware platform that is capable of providing a downlink to mobile phones and small devices directly from satellites in orbit – all without the use of a satellite dish on Earth or a third-party network. \n\nAsk us questions about anything: blockchain, semiconductors and open-source hardware!\n\nETA AmA proof image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13NGtR7pkzhjuZ2G-WuqPvXj00dUVsuHC/view?usp=sharing",
