I'm a 33 y/o born and raised Texan, owner and operator of a home health care agency, and a resident of Pearland, where I live with my wife Christine and our 2 y/o son, Jude. I'm also a [semi-decent guitar/ukulele player](https://twitter.com/Travis4TX/status/1311054127213039616?s=20) and [hot sauce enthusiast](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/reddit29). Make a donation and we'll send you a bottle! (While supplies last)\n\nThis seat was uncontested in 2018 but Beto O'Rourke came within 5 points of winning the district. This year, polling has this race in a dead heat and I believe our message of treating Health Care as a human right, expanding/protecting access to voting, and equal justice for all is moving new voters to the polls. \nThe Texas Legislature is 9 seats away from the first Democratic majority in decades and we're determined to be a part of that wave. Our State government has been run by the same stagnant leadership for too long and it's time for them to learn that re-election should not be a given. \n\nWe're endorsed by the AFL/CIO, End Citizens United, Planned Parenthood, Clean Water Action, the Human Rights Campaign, and many others!\n\nI'll be back tomorrow, 10/7 at 11am cst to answer questions. \nIn the mean time, take a look at [our new TV spot!](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/boldtct)\n\n[Website](https://travis4tx.com/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Travis4tx)\n\n[Facebook](https://facebook.com/Travis4tx)\n__________________________________________\n\n[Click HERE to ask Travis Boldt questions beginning today at 12:00 EST](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/j682ia/im_travis_boldt_candidate_for_texas_hd29_ama/)",
