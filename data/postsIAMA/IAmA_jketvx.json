My new book, A Brotherhood Betrayed, focuses on the brief moment before World War II erupted when America's attention was fixated on the streets of Brooklyn—the streets where Murder Incorporated held court. This is the story of the one man who attempted to take them down.  \n\n\nI've also written books about The Mad Bomber of NYC (Incendiary), the 1961 Grand Prix Circuit (The Limit), and a biography of architect I.M. Pei. Once upon a time I was an editor at the New York Times and I've also written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and many other publications. I live in New York City.  \n\n\nSo let's chat! We can talk about the mob, architecture, New York City history, or anything in between. I'm looking forward to it!  \n\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about A Brotherhood Betrayed, you can find that \\[here\\] ([https://static.macmillan.com/static/minotaur/brotherhood-betrayed/](https://static.macmillan.com/static/minotaur/brotherhood-betrayed/)).
