We are qualified and practicing psychologists.\n\nSomething that mixes your whole life up suddenly can turn up the heat on all the problems we are used to juggling as part of a busy life. Even if you have never considered yourself someone who has ‘mental health problems’ you might have some questions about how to handle whatever you are finding tricky right now.\n\n[www.helpers.tools](http://www.helpers.tools/) is a free 6 week course of support delivered over email that we built as a volunteer effort. It is not a business or commercial project. Combining short and simple behavioural nudges with longer weekly sessions designed to be used by two or more people in conversation, the helpers tools are designed to be a blueprint enabling a community to provide crucial psychological support for itself - without needing to wait.\n\nHere’s the proof: [https://www.helpers.tools/ama\\_proof](https://www.helpers.tools/ama_proof)\n\nPS: While we’re doing this to provide support it is not intended to replace individual treatment with your local mental health services.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** **We're out of time!**\n\nThank you to everyone who asked questions tonight. We know we haven’t been able to get around to everyone’s queries, but we’d encourage people to look around the thread as there are several common themes and we might have answered a question similar to yours.\n\nWe’d like to send our best wishes to everyone out there doing their best in these difficult, uncertain times and we urge you to remember that you don’t have to be alone with any difficult thoughts and feelings.\n\nPlease speak to your local mental health professionals if your wellbeing is significantly affected, particularly if you’re contemplating self-harm or suicide.
