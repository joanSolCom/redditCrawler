In 2017, I got the opportunity of a lifetime: After searching long and hard for a PhD position that allowed me to write a dissertation on videogames, I not only found an amazing supervisor but also became part of a team that founded a master's programme revolving entirely around the analysis, creation, and technical understanding of the medium in Klagenfurt, Austria.\n\nEver since then, I have been involved in a large number of videogame-related activities at the university, including the organisation of lesson plans and conferences, the supervision of student projects and indie studio foundations and publications to hosting videogame art exhibitions.\n\nIt's been a pretty wild ride that I want to share with you, so ask me anything!\n\nThe AMA is going to open at 3AM EST (9AM CET) to 10AM EST (4PM CET). There is going to be a break of roughly two hours around 5AM EST (11AM CET) during which two of my students and I are hosting a mini crash course on videogame analysis for an online convention via Twitch (to which you are all kindly invited, I'll post a link as soon as possible :-)).\n\n[Picture proof here - that's me! :-)](https://i.imgur.com/7FBvimh.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Alright everybody, time to call it a day! Thank you so much for making this very first AmA of mine a blast. I'll have to pack shop now but am going to answer anything I might have missed later today. Have a nice day and game on! :-)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Wow! I never imagined that this thread would skyrocket as much as it did. Thank you so much for making my first AMA awesome, dear redditors! I'll be doing one more round in this thread, answering everything that I can answer properly! :-)",
