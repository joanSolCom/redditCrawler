I started as a visual artist, but when I heard the Velvet Underground, I instantly wanted to create atmospheres in sound, so I took up the guitar.  I went on to start a band called The Modern Lovers when I was 19, and twenty-odd years ago, my drummer Tommy and I made music for the movie, \"There's Something About Mary.\"  Questions do not have to be in English;  French, Spanish, and Italian are also great!

We'll be taking a break, but we'll be back to see if there are more questions to answer at 6pm Pacific Time.\n\nUpdate:  It's 6:08pm here (we're a bit late) and we're back!\n\nUpdate:  It looks like we managed to catch up on questions, so we're wrapping it up for tonight.  This was great!  We'll leave this open for questions over night for those folks in different time zones.  We'll answer any remaining questions tomorrow, and that will be that!  Thanks for a fantastic time!\n\nUpdate:  Hello, everyone.  We're back!  We'll be answering the new questions which have come in since yesterday evening, and then ending this AMA.\n\nUpdate:  It's 2:43pm on October 2nd, and we believe we've answered all the questions that came in, so we're done with this AMA.  \n\nFrom Jonathan -- Unless I decide to do one of these again, please remember that I don't have a presence on social media.  I also won't be looking at this account, so if you message me here, please don't expect a response.  And please watch out for false Jonathan Richmans on the internet, because we've already seen a few.  Thanks for all the great questions, it was a bunch of fun!",
