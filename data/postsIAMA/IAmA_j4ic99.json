BFRBs are a group of disorders including hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting among others, and occur in 2-3% of the population. \n\nFor 29 years we've been at the forefront of raising awareness for the common but under recognized and diagnosed disorders, providing community support, and funding research. We raised over $2 million to fund the largest multi-site study looking at BFRBs. We provide educational resources to therapists, doctors, and cosmetologists, and community resources to people with BFRBs including support groups, webinars, courses, and an annual conference. \n\nWe are not doctors or licensed clincians, just a group of dedicated people who want to raise awareness and help others.\n\nAsk us anything about the disorders, our work, the organization. We're happy to answer it all!\n\n[Proof](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF0Rz5eDNUU/)\n\nUpdate: Thanks everyone for asking questions, it was super fun answering them for all of you.
