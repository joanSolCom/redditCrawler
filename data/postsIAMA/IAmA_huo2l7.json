I build the [Apollo for Reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) and worked at Apple prior to that. Last year through the Reddit community [we broke the all-time, single day donation record for my SPCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cg18r3/update_on_yesterdays_apollo_spca_fundraiser_ama/). This year with the SPCA needing the help more than ever, I'm determined to beat that record and raise even more money this year!\n\nIn the summer of 2014 I was getting my Computer Science degree in eastern Canada and was lucky enough to land an internship at Apple all the way over in Cupertino, California, which was a long way from home! I learned an absolute ton there and it really changed my life and made me want to build apps as a career, after seeing how amazing it is how many people you can reach with an app you create.\n\nSo I set out to build my Reddit app Apollo after not being satisfied with any of the Reddit apps available. I wanted something super fast and lean, while also having a ton of power features and a really clean design that's fun to use. Fortunately that resonated with a lot of people, and Apollo garnered a lot of interest and had a lot of beta testers, making the eventual release really, really awesome and now it's gone on to be downloaded over 2 million times and it's been my full-time job since way back in 2015 after I graduated university. It's iOS only for now (and was [voted the best iOS Reddit app](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/)) but I'd love to build it for Android too one day if I get the chance (I'm just one guy building this and time is tight)!\n\n### So, what's the plan for raising a bunch of money for the SPCA?\n\n-  **Today, 100% of the proceeds from the app will go to the SPCA Animal Shelter in Nova Scotia.** I need to break that donation record. If you have even a passing interest in Apollo, today's an awesome day to unlock the Pro or Ultra version, but even if you already have, I went a step further this year and commissioned a really gorgeous custom app icon by the almost offensively talented [David Lanham](https://dlanham.com/). Not only today, but every day going forward forever, all the proceeds from that icon will be going to the Nova Scotia SPCA, so unlocking that icon would mean an absolute ton to me. [Here's a peek at the icon.](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png) It also comes with some custom wallpapers and an Apollo Community Pets Photo Album!\n- You can also **donate directly to the fundraiser page I created**, which would be amazing! https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/apollo-app-2020-spca-fundraiser/ This gives you a direct way to donate if you already have the app, or just are awesome and want to donate directly. This is terrific too if you work for a cool company that does donation-matching, which would double your donation!\n- For every comment this thread gets, I'll donate $0.10 (including my own answers), so if you have even a silly question, go for it! (Just don't spam haha, don't want to create trouble for the mods)\n\n### Why right now? Everything okay with the shelter?\n\nThis warm time of the year is really rough on the shelter. These months are dubbed \"[kitten season](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/)\" because it's far and away the most active times for kittens to give birth. The shelters get overwhelmed with orphaned and surrendered (and sometimes left for dead) kittens from owners who are surprised to find their cat gave birth, and the shelter's resources (like food) get incredibly strained. A tidal wave of kittens sounds cute in theory, but it's seriously overwhelming.\n\nWorse, with the COVID pandemic, kitten season is poised to be even worse this year with less people bringing in their pets to be neutered, and less adoptions occurring from people staying inside, so they're really hurting more than ever.\n\nEDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly!",
