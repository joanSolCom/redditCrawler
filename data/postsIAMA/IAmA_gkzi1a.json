The whole point of putting classes online was for the schools to save money and for corporate america to enable the rat racers to stay productive while they complete degrees.   \n\nPeople in the fields of nursing or education find themselves working overtime AND they are expected to continue their education.  Same thing with a lot of people who get promoted to a management position and the company sends them to complete their business administration degree - there's not enough time.  \n\nIt's \\*possible\\* to do it without an online class assistant, but not if you want to get enough sleep, be available for family, perform well at work, etc.  \n\nI  feel kind of guilty about how easy things are for me right now as an academic writer. The online class assistant industry is in high  demand.  And now we get more orders than ever because the pandemic caused more classes to be put online. I'm  also fortunate because as a freelance academic writer I can stay in my apartment where it's safe, &amp; I  keep making money.  \n\nAMA!   It's okay if you want to say freelance academic writers are terrible for doing other people's research for them.
