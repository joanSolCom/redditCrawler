This district includes all of Coastal Georgia, including beautiful Savannah, and half our border with Florida. Along with Pam Keith in Florida and Jackie Gordon in New York, I’m running to be one of the first ever veteran black women elected to either chamber of Congress. [Proof](https://twitter.com/JoyceGriggs2020/status/1315716646938587137).\n\n* [Donate!](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/joycegriggs2020-tw-1) (even $5 helps!)\n* [Volunteer!](https://griggsforcongress.com/volunteer/sign-up/)\n\nFollow us:\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoyceGriggs2020)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JoyceGriggs2020)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/JoyceGriggs2020)\n\nI'll be joined by my Senior Advisor, Greg, who will be using the username u/TeamJoyceGriggs.\n\nBio:\n\nI was born the sixth of ten children in Bethel, North Carolina, and raised in a share-cropping family. My parents had no formal education, but worked hard to put me through school. I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and a Master’s degree in counseling from North Carolina Central University. After graduate school, I served as a head counselor and psychology instructor at Kittrell College, as well as a volunteer tutor for underprivileged children with learning disabilities. I raised two children of my own along the way, Torri and Laurie, who've given me five beautiful grandchildren.\n\nIn 1975, I became one of the first women to complete airborne training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Upon admission to the Women’s Army Corps, I completed training in basic and advanced military intelligence/tactical training, psychological operations, civil military operations, command and general staff, combined arms services, intelligence collection management, and women’s officer training, all in rapid succession, attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. I also served as a professor of military science in Honolulu, Hawaii. Deployed in arenas from the Middle East to the continent of Africa as an Army Intelligence Officer, I received commendations such as the parachutist badge, the Defense Meritorious Service medal, the Global War on Terrorism medal, and the Bronze Star.\n\nAfter 33 years in the Army, I became an Attorney, earning my J.D. from the John Marshall Law School in Atlanta. I worked tirelessly for clients from all walks of life and often without charge for those who were unable to afford legal representation, earning a Pro Bono Award and the Chief Justice Award for Professionalism. I have affiliated with numerous citizen groups and served on humanitarian missions in several impoverished nations in South America and Africa.\n\nI ran for Congress and came up short in 2000 - but I think Georgia is changing. We’re ready for new leadership. Nowhere are Republican failures on coronavirus, healthcare, the economy, or democracy itself more acutely felt than here in Georgia, where our leaders have botched public service at every level of government. We are ready to ride the high-water mark of the biggest blue wave in American history.\n\nAnd I’m ready to take your questions. AMA!\n\n**Edit: I've had to step out but I will be back. Keep the questions coming!**\n\n**Edit: Thank you all, this was fun!**",
