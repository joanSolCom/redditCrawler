This led to several surgeries as a kid to rebuild my foot but it ended up not working out in the end and I had a trans-tibial amputation when I was 16.\n\nIt's been a long road but I'm excited to be graduating from University this June. I had also completed a program a year previously.\n\nI've done AncestryDNA and I know my estimated ethnicity but I got no hits on close family.
