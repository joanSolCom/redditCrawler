I was born with a congenital heart defect, had to undergo numerous surgeries, almost died of heart failure, got my transplant and now I am living my best life 13 years later as a school teacher. My transplant story was one heck of a roller coaster. Ask me anything you want. I will answer to the best of my ability.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much for all the questions. Please feel free to ask as  many as you want. There is no aspect of my transplant that I am embarrassed about.\n\nEdit 2: Fun fact about myself. I was apart of the Guinness World Record for most transplant recipients gathered in one place. There was 540 fellow recipients all gathered in one spot at the Transplant Games of America held in Salt Lake City, Utah. This was in 2018.\n\nEdit 3: I also failed to mention that my previous heart actually stunted my growth. Pre-transplant I was only 4 foot, 11 inches and 85 lbs. I was a shrimp. By January of 2008 I was pushing 5 foot 6 inches and weighed close to 130Lbs. I am now 5' 11\" and weigh 170 lbs. My doctors predicted I would be around 6ft shortly after I was born... I was not disappointed.",
