Florida has been under one-party rule for 20 years, resulting in a state government that focuses on pleasing corporate donors, listening to special interests, and partisan virtue signaling instead of providing solutions to our 21st century challenges.\n\nIn my district, the biggest challenge is preserving the environment to maintain our quality of life. The long-term existential threat to my district is climate change. Florida is surrounded on three sides by water, putting us on the front lines of the climate crisis. My top priority as a legislator is to make polluters pay for their carbon emissions. Pricing in the true environmental cost of carbon will harness the power of the market toward progressive ends and is the single best thing we can do to decarbonize our economy. I also support building up the renewable energy infrastructure required to power Florida in the future.\n\nWe have had a water pollution crisis for several years, with polluted water making its way down to my district from upstate, causing breakouts of cyanobacteria and red tide. These algal blooms punish our economy and sicken our bodies physically. I support tighter regulation of agricultural runoff, restoring the natural flow of water south from Lake Okeechobee through the Everglades, and empowering local governments in mitigating the effects of pollution.\n\nMy family and I came to Florida from Puerto Rico 28 years ago with nothing but a few suitcases. I saw my parents work hard to make ends meet and I helped them out. My district is full of working-class families that have never had an effective advocate in Tallahassee, and that needs to change. From criminal justice reform, to ending drug incarceration, from affordable health care and housing, to ending discrimination, I believe in empowering everyone in my district to live their best lives. We can win in November, but I cannot do it alone. I need your help. This is a team effort.\n_________________________________\n\n[AMA begins here at 12:00 ET](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/hvethf/i_am_joshua_lopez_candidate_for_florida_state/)",
