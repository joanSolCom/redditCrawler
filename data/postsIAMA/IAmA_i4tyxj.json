I was forced to marry as a child and spent my teenage years surrounded by brutal a civil war. \n\nWhen I was 19, I joined the British Army with the Gurkhas. I served with them for 15 years until I stepped on an IED whilst on patrol and lost both my legs. My life changed in an instant. I joined the Gurkhas prepared to die for the cause, but never considered the possibility that I would suffer the kind of injuries that I did.\n\nSince my injury I have battled to regain my confidence, this was a huge challenge both mentally and physically. A big part of this was many different adventure sports, I was the first disabled person to ski in my native Nepal, and one of the first to kayak around the Isle of Wight. My main passion now is climbing mountains. \n\nSo far, I have summited:     \n\n⦁\tMont Blanc (4,810m)    \n⦁\tKilimanjaro (5,895m)     \n⦁\tChulu Far East (6,059m)     \n⦁\tMera Peak (6,476m) (became 1st ever DAK to summit a 6,000m+ peak)     \n\nUpcoming Expeditions:     \n\n⦁\tHimlung Himal (7,126m)\n⦁\tMount Everest (8,848m) - There has never been an attempt from a DAK.\n\nClimbing Mount Everest was my childhood dream, but it has become so much more than that for me. I want to use the Everest expedition to prove that Nothing is Impossible. With this expedition and my mountaineering in general I want to do two things:\n1) Inspire as many people as possible to go out and conquer their dreams. \n2) Raise awareness for, and change the perspective on disabilities. \n\n**TLDR: https://youtu.be/qa8BDnkOADI**\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about my childhood in Nepal, my time with the Gurkhas, my injury or recovery, my adventures &amp; mountaineering, the challenges I have faced, climbing Mount Everest, or other upcoming plans. Not to say everything else is off-limits, but that should be enough to get this started...\n\nYou can find out more about my story via any of these links:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hari_budha_magar/     \nYouTube: https://youtu.be/qa8BDnkOADI     \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HariBudhaMagarDAK/     \nWebsite: https://www.haribudhamagar.com/\n\nPROOF: https://www.instagram.com/p/CDjagY5B2Au/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet",
