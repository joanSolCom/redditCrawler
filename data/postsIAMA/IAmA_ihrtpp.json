I am Dr. Aaron Beek, a Research Fellow at [North-West University](http://www.nwu.ac.za/) in South Africa, and I’ve worked at numerous universities in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. I don’t have a page up yet at my new university, but [my old faculty page at the University of Memphis](https://www.memphis.edu/history/faculty/faculty/aaron-beek.php) is still up, or you can turn to [my page on Academia](https://memphis.academia.edu/AaronBeek)! \n&gt; \n&gt; My work focuses on unconventional and illegitimate forms of warfare and violence, including pirates, bandits, mercenaries, other forms of freebooters, and even the occasional politician. My first book (not out yet, I’m afraid) focuses on how ancient writers react to episodes of piracy, while my second book (not out for a ***while***, I’m afraid) instead examines the Romans’ recruitment of their own auxiliaries, mercenaries, and other ‘nonstandard’, non-legion troops.  I have previously written articles on piracy, slave wars, the civil wars in 1st century rome, mercenary employment, soldiers in Judea, and political polemic, just to give you an idea of my range.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some initial food for thought: one of my key starting observations is that a very large percentage of men in the ancient world have precisely two skill-sets for making a living: farming and fighting. And if you take away their farms…then they start to look for ways to use their other set of skills.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Most of my work is on the periods of the late Hellenistic and early Empire, but I’ll do my best to field anything between 700 and 700.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because of differences in time zones, I’m posting \\~3pm ET (which is at night for me), and I’ll try to answer a few early questions, then I’ll come back in (my) morning \\~2am-6am ET to respond to the bulk.  Apologies in advance for the delay!",
