To date we are the only 3rd party content platform second only to the main store by facebook. \n\nFast forward 12 months, we have exploded to 290K monthly active users and our launcher application has just passed 1 million downloads across all versions. Needless to say this is the biggest accomplishment of my life and I'm hugely proud to help push this new technology forward. \n\nTo celebrate I spent the last week building a relaxing experience designed to help keep you from going crazy during lockdown. The game is called BlanketWorks ( shameless plug ) - https://twitter.com/SideQuestVR/status/1263534205167964162?s=19 and it lets you build blanket forts in VR with some relaxing music for free. It was inspired by re-watching community on netflix recently as well as increasing cabin fever from being stuck at home.\n\nThat's my story! I hope you like it!",
