Proof of me-ness:\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillCorbett/status/1258432772223401984](https://twitter.com/BillCorbett/status/1258432772223401984)\n\nI'll be here for the next two hours, then on and off after that. Ask me anything! I'll try to answer as many Qs as I can.\n\nI would also love to let everyone know about the online benefit performance of my comedy HATE MAIL, co-written with Kira Obolensky, tomorrow night.\n\nI'm incredibly excited about the cast: **RHEA SEEHORN** of TV's *BETTER CALL SAUL* and **PAUL F. TOMPKINS** of *BOJACK HORSEMAN*, *MR. SHOW*, etc., comedy and podcast legend in general.  I've been lucky enough to work with both of these wonderful performers in the past and I'm so so grateful they've agreed to do this. Based on seeing our one (one!) rehearsal, they are going to be amazing together.  Here's where to get tickets:\n\n[https://hatemail.simpletix.com/e/53553](https://hatemail.simpletix.com/e/53553)\n\nAbout the play: HATE MAIL was written about 20 years ago, starting as a sort of parody of the popular theater piece LOVE LETTERS.  It was meant to be performed likewise, just two actors with a simple set reading correspondence. The play has had a really nice life in theaters for the past two decades and it just seemed like a natural fit for these days of pandemic-y online performances.\n\nALL proceeds from the play will go to **PARTNERS IN HEALTH**, a great non-profit organization dedicated to getting medical health and supplies to those who need it most.  And their specific focus on the Coronavirus pandemic has been excellent:\n\n[https://www.pih.org/coronavirus-response](https://www.pih.org/coronavirus-response)\n\nAll that said! Please ask away. I'll be there answering away until about 1 pm eastern, 10 am pacific but will stop by as much as possible to answer Qs for a few hours after that too.  Looking forward to this!\n\n**\\[ADDED SEVERAL HOURS LATER:**  Thank you all!  I got to as many questions as I could and I'll stop by for a bit in a few hours, to see if I can or should answer a few more.  FWIW I tended to skip past questions where I'd already answered something very similar and / or where multiple-part questions made it tough to handle right now. Will be back later, but if your Q fits that bill and I haven't gotten there yet, that might be why.  Cheers, more soon..\\]",
