I could go into detail about how I sold my biggest film - about exorcism - to the BBC. Here it is, by the way:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l78hW8qVIWI\n\nIn my time, I've made films about exorcism, abortion, pedophilia, UFO belief and many other themes and figures on the fringes. You'll find many of them on my \n\nYouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3aiQJmnJ8wamobGcsBz6Ww? \nPodcast - https://podfollow.com/the-andrew-gold-podcast\n\nThe podcasts have been with a Westboro Baptist Church member, an ex-Hasidic Jew, a transhumanist and the world's first ever blogger. And I've recorded new ones, planning to release pods in the coming weeks with an 18-year-old pedophile, a gay black porn star talking about racism in the industry and an ex-Muslim being stalked by her family.\n\nHappy to talk about any of these experiences or just how to break into the industry.\n\nProof of me: https://twitter.com/AndrewGold_ok/status/1275141814824112128",
