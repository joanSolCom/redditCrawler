Head-first, 90mph down an ice luge track on a tea-tray.\n\nIn March of 2014, I joined Bobsled/Skeleton Israel and tried my hand at the sport in Lake Placid, NY.  I was given a scouting report that said in part that I would \"never be competitive,\" and I would \"get down the track, but that'll be the most of it.\"  I decided then and there that I would not rest until Israel qualified for the Olympics in skeleton. As I could not afford a traveling coach, I spent the next four years breathing the mission, watching 10+ hours of YouTube video/day and taking, on average, twice the usual training volume.\n\n\\~1 in 5 Americans suffer from depression.  After prolonged bullying in middle school depression became a part of my life as well.  Depression is not ever a blessing, but I have used it for many years as a motivator to accomplish bigger and better things.  I'm an advocate for trying to use the power of our negative experiences to push us to heights we had never thought possible of ourselves.  I also do work and volunteer to help kids try to overcome bullying and advocate for better awareness for mental health.\n\nAlong the way I've made some interesting decisions (I chose pursuing the Olympics over investing in Halo Top ice cream, I pulled my cryptocurrency out before the boom to afford training, etc.) but always keep in perspective that I've been incredibly blessed, and look forward to the next adventure.\n\nMy next goal is qualifying Israel for the 2022 Winter Olympics in bobsled (if I can find a few more athletes and sponsor, we'll be off to the races so let me know if you’re interested in this upcoming journey!) and helping my fellow skeleton teammates qualify, as well.\n\nFeel free to follow/message on ig [@ajedelman](https://www.instagram.com/ajedelman/) or email!
