        "selftext": "Hi Reddit!\n\nMy name is Annie Nikunen. I am an NYC-based flutist, composer, dancer and choreographer, as well as sound artist and radio broadcaster. As a flutist, I am a founding member of new music group BlackBox Ensemble, and have performed in contemporary, classical, jazz, dance and Taize settings. My compositional work ranges from concert music and field recordings to dance and film; I explore connections between composition and choreography, always considering the physicality of sound in relation to movement and space. I also explore dynamics of human relationships in my work, including cycles of brokenness and healing, and how sound and movement can represent those processes. Ballet was my initial career track, so I vowed to incorporate my love for movement into my work with sound. On the media side, I am a music/dance reviewer for Bachtrack, and served as Director of the Classical Department and Business Manager at WKCR, where I host a weekly show every Friday featuring the music of New York City Ballet as well as choral, orchestral and film works.\n\nI was asked to become a host for the Beethoven marathon on his birthday! So for 24 straight hours we're going to be hosting interviews, performances and greetings from artists and special guests from around the world in dedication to Beethoven!
