In practice this means having a choice around what personal info they disclose or keep private.  Our app [Blur](https://dnt.abine.com/#register) is a privacy-focused password manager that lets anyone mask their credit-card, phone number and email-address.  Our flagship brand,  [DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/), is a service where privacy experts help you remove personal information from online data brokers.  Our core customer base is North American, but US-based data brokers (and those who use their data) often have global coverage, so our data-removal services have applicability for an international audience.\n\nI've been part of consumer-privacy issues for many years, ranging from participating in the working-group that helped develop the California Consumer Privacy Act, to the old “Do Not Track” standards-development, to helping develop IdentityForce - software to help protect individuals and organizations from data breaches and Identity Theft threats.\n\nRecently I’ve been most-focused on things like:\n\n* how people can stop their private info from being searchable on Google and for sale at data brokers\n* how to reduce robocalls\n* how companies should best adapt to changing GDPR/CCPA regs\n* how to improve transaction security online - especially using crypto and blockchain tech for better privacy and security\n\nWe've also been monitoring increased threats to individual privacy and business-security created by the massive shift to working-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If anything, recent circumstances have only increased the need for people to actively improve their online privacy.\n\nAsk me anything! Including:\n\n* the likely future of online privacy regulation\n* understanding differences between privacy and security\n* the role of data brokers in the privacy landscape\n* the impact of new technologies (like facial recognition) on future privacy\n\nParticipating in the IAMA will be myself (u/slvrspoon1), my colleagues Adam Frey (COO) and Adrew Sudbury (CTO), and /u/AbineReddit and /u/CEOUNICOM to aid with question-response.\n\nWe'll be available for Q+A from Thursday, July 23rd at 12PM EST to Saturday, July 25 at 12PM EST.\n\nLooking forward to it!",
