I'm a joint-degree student at Yale Law School and Yale School of Management, and I hold an M.Phil in Criminology from the University of Cambridge, where I wrote my thesis on the history and causes of mass incarceration. Encountering mass incarceration through both academic and personal lenses––with several childhood friends having been incarcerated – motivated me to think of solutions.\n\nMass incarceration is expensive ($182b spent annually), destructive (113m U.S. adults impacted), and ineffective (55% recidivism within 3 years). With a system so broken, it can be hard to know where to begin. I've identified a specific problem: the exploitative prison telecommunications industry. It can cost up to $25 for a 15 minute phone call. 1/3 of families with incarcerated loved ones go into debt because of the costs of staying in touch.\n\nThrough our products Letters for Families, Letters for Organizations, and Connect (our forthcoming video conferencing platform), Ameelio will connect the 2.3 million incarcerated Americans to vital support networks outside. Our free communication tools will lift financial burdens from low-income families, and support connection to build community, break cycles of intergenerational harm, and reduce recidivism. We’re taking an innovative approach to decarceration. Policy changes will take a long time. In the meantime, those trapped in our justice system will continue to suffer its inhumanity. So, we're beginning with our products, which support communities and reduce recidivism while strengthening economic and moral arguments for legislative change.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could contribute to our [Kickstarter campaign](http://bit.ly/Ameelio). We already hit our goal, but we're trying to reach $50,000 to support 4,000 families. All proceeds will fund free letters for families.\n\nYou can learn more about us at [ameelio.org](http://ameelio.org/).
