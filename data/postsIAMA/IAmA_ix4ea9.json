I'm a person in long term recovery. Of course, I still struggle with my alcoholism in different forms. Fortunately, I am surrounded by resources that I would love to share with everyone today. I'm also the host of [The Courage To Change: A Recovery Podcast](https://www.lionrockrecovery.com/resources/podcast)! Ask me anything about addiction, treatment, and resources. I’m here to help!\n\n[Lionrock](https://www.lionrockrecovery.com/) is the leader in online substance use disorder treatment.
