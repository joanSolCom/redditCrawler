AMA about chasing your crazy dreams (you know you've got 'em)\n\n**Background:**\n\nI'm Phil Mosby. Just an ordinary guy who, at the age of 35, decided to buy a [van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) and a [large format printer](https://i.imgur.com/ZpW3mZm.jpg), quit my comfy job, and attempt to make a living capturing, [printing](https://vimeo.com/258199504), and selling [my astro-landscape photos](https://phil.camera/portfolio/) and [print creations](https://i.imgur.com/Gnjr2Uz.jpg) full time. That was 3.5 years ago, in early 2017, and somehow I'm still kickin' and doing what I love!\n\nIn the summer of 2018, thanks in part to Reddit, I was able to [hang one of my hexagon cluster pieces](https://imgur.com/gallery/GSOtioc) on the wall of the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. This was one of the best honors of my life, and the subject of my [last ama](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9d8hsu/im_phil_mosby_almost_2_years_ago_i_quit_my_comfy/).\n\nIn 2019 I opened a small [brick and mortar gallery](https://imgur.com/a/nTIktRu) in North Lake Tahoe (including a room for my \"[glowing night](https://i.imgur.com/S2rXT58.mp4)\" prints) ...but fairly quickly found out that retail life is not for me ... and at the end of the year closed the gallery down to re-focus my efforts on my online art sales (which have been my main source of income all along). It was disappointing, but hey, sometimes you gotta try something to find out it's not for you! In the long run it turns out I was extremely lucky on the timing, having focused all of my efforts into my online business months before Covid reared its ugly head.\n\n**Present &amp; Future:**\n\nDuring this strange quaran-time, I've finally had the mental space to complete two massive projects that have both been on my list for, literally, years:\n\n\\#1 ***Nights On Earth*** my 2021 Wall Calendar and Stargazer's Guide to the Night Sky ([preview on Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/GUNcM33)) ([official website](https://phil.camera/2021/)), which is just loaded with [interesting space facts and useful data-points](https://i.imgur.com/ZrVGTLX.jpg) for any stargazer (as well as 13 of my best Lake Tahoe astro-landscape photos, of course). It was a labor of love to compile all this data, but I hope I succeeded in creating something that is beautiful, interesting, *and* incredibly useful to anyone with even a passing interest in space or stargazing (I can't wait to use it myself to plan next year's astro photography!)\n\n...and then for my next feat of massively long days at the computer...\n\n\\#2 [**NatureMixer.com**](https://NatureMixer.com) I spent the last two+ months developing Nature Mixer, a website that I have been \"thinking about\" (and shooting video to \"someday\" use for this purpose) for over 5 years.  It allows you to mix together a custom, endlessly-looping, audio-visual naturescape to help you relax, focus, or even fall asleep to. This is another project that I made as much for myself as for anyone else. I use it daily while working and quite often while sleeping (pro-tip, on most phones you can minimize your  browser and the audio will keep playing).  I love this site almost more than anything else I've ever made. I hope you'll check it out and tell me I did good.\n\n**AMA:**\n\nI'm now 38 years old and still have absolutely no idea where I'll be in a year (let alone 5) but I (still) have no regrets about chasing my dreams, and I *believe* I'm currently doing the best work of my life...\n\nAMA about the photo business, print making, selling art online, recklessly chasing your dreams at all costs, calendars, oh and NATUREMIXER of course :) Whatever you want. I'm not necessarily an expert about anything but I might know enough to talk your ear off.\n\n**Socials:**\n\n[www.facebook.com/](https://www.facebook.com/lightenvy/)[lightenvy/](https://www.facebook.com/lightenvy/)\n\n[www.instagram.com/phil.camera/](https://www.instagram.com/phil.camera/)\n\n[www.twitter.com/philmosbyphoto/](https://www.twitter.com/philmosbyphoto/)\n\n**Proof:**  [https://twitter.com/philmosbyphoto/status/1268692819574587392](https://twitter.com/philmosbyphoto/status/1268692819574587392)\n\nI'll be here for a few hours this evening (until at least 8pm pdt) and maybe again tomorrow morning if there's any interest in talking. Thanks for reading this far!\n\nEdit: Thanks for that gold thingy. I don't feel like I've earned it, but it sure looks nice up there.",
