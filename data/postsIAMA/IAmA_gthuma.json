I pondered on this question for a long time; how could I possibly come up with an idea to resolve this problem that many people might have. My solution was simple: what if I could preserve voices the way we preserve photographs. What if we could hang voices on a wall? Or print them on T-shirts?\n\nThat is when we started [www.soundwaveshop.com](http://www.soundwaveshop.com/) and asked people to upload their recordings on the platform. The website then, converts the audio files to visual images (the same way we can see heart beats on a monitor!)  and then users can order and we print them on T-shirts or canvases. On  each of these prints, there is a Qr code which you can scan to hear your recording. \n\nAnyways, I know there are many aspiring entrepreneurs outhere with amazing stories of turning their problems into business opportunities and I wanted to share mine. Ask me anything about how to start a business when you are young and have very little money! or anything about the idea!\n\nProof: This is the link to [my personal instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/kiarashmh/) and [business instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/soundwave.shop/).
