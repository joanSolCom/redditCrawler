In late 2019 I was diagnosed with JIA (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and given anti-inflammatories to manage it. In January 2020 I was diagnosed with the flu, then in February I had strep throat, and in March I got mono and the flu again, only I also had large rashes on my legs/ankles and my eyes were bloodshot 24/7 (i wasn’t a stoner or on any drugs at the time) so I was hospitalized overnight after going to the emergency room about the rashes because they did extensive blood work and found out I had severe anemia and was borderline in kidney failure. Fast forward to the next day, I’m released from the hospital under the condition that we’ll do more testing with my doctors. About a week goes by (this is during the time I had the flu for the 2nd time) and I wake up from a long night of coughing with a large bump on my forehead as if I’d smacked my head on something, but there was no bruising and it was only getting bigger as the morning went on (it was in my hairline stretching to my eyebrow on the entire left side of my forehead) so we sent pictures to my rheumatologist and nephrologist and they contacted me and told me to go to children’s hospital immediately. I’m admitted, get a ct scan and mri of my head, and due to the rashes and testing to find out potentially what it is, a ct scan of my chest. They think I have gpa (granulomatosis with polyangiitis) but will need a kidney biopsy to confirm. But as I’m anemic, I need to get a blood transfusion before they feel safe performing the biopsy. I get the transfusion along with iv steroids for my head, and they determine I’ve recovered from the flu and my blood levels are high enough to perform the biopsy the next day. They perform the biopsy and confirm GPA, and proceed to do blood tests and tests on my lungs to ensure it’s only affecting my kidneys. They did five days of strong iv steroids to try and help my kidneys recover, and the night before I was released they gave me a dose of cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug) to knock out my immune system so it stops attacking my kidneys and joints. At this point they’ve taken me off my medication for arthritis because it’s hurting my kidneys, and I’m not allowed to take any NSAIDS because they’re bad for my kidneys as well. I was in the hospital for the second time a grand total of five days, and I was released with an order to continue doing cytoxan monthly for a total of 6 doses, as well as taking iron supplements and prescription steroids. So far I’ve done 3 out of 6 of my doses and I’ve got the 4th one scheduled. I’m down to 20mg of prednisone every morning (it was 60 when I was released) but the side effects caused me to have significant weight gain. This far into the treatment, I’ve experienced mild hair thinning, and nausea/vomiting the night and morning after the cytoxan. I have to be extremely careful about what I do and where I go especially now with covid-19, because I have a compromised immune system. It made life very difficult for me, but I’m finally starting to be able to see friends again. I’ve felt like an outcast but reading everyone else’s stories here has made me feel less like an anomaly or burden. This is my first time sharing my story on the or anywhere publicly really. Thank you so much to anyone who has bothered to read this far. Any questions or comments or advice you have, feel free to comment!
