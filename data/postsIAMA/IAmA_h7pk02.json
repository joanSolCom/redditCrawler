We are Comilla Sasson M.D., Ph.D., FAHA, and Alexis Topjian M.D., M.S.C.E., FAHA.\n\nAbout Dr. Sasson: I’m a Denver-based emergency room doctor who recently spent a month in New York City caring for patients with COVID-19 at a temporary hospital at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. While serving there, I continued my work alongside the American Heart Association as vice president for emergency cardiovascular care science and innovation. The COVID-19 crisis has presented new and unique challenges in performing emergency cardiovascular care that have required quick, science-based solutions and guidance for health care professionals and the public around the world. \n\nAbout Dr. Topjian: I am a Philadelphia-based pediatric critical care medicine physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I also serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pediatrics at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nThe American Heart Association encourages the public to call 911, especially if they or a loved one may be having a stroke or heart attack. A new cause for concern during the pandemic is that fewer people are calling 911. It’s important to remember that hospitals are still the safest place to be if you are having a heart attack or a stroke. Don’t hesitate or doubt: Call 911 at the first sign of a heart attack or stroke. \n\nWe’ll be answering your questions on how COVID-19 has affected patient and resuscitation care, interim CPR guidance during COVID-19, and ways hospitals are adjusting and treating non-COVID patients safely. Dr. Sasson can also discuss her time caring for COVID-19 patients in New York City. Ask us Anything!\n\nResources: \n\n[Interim CPR guidelines address challenges of providing resuscitation during COVID-19 pandemic](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/interim-cpr-guidelines-address-challenges-of-providing-resuscitation-during-covid-19-pandemic)\n\n[American Heart Association urges patients to quickly call 911 for chest pain or heart symptoms](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/american-heart-association-urges-patients-to-quickly-call-911-for-chest-pain-or-heart-symptoms)\n\n[Verification](https://imgur.com/a/l6thVNi)\n\nEdit: thanks for asking questions, have a good weekend!",
