It’s up to us to take responsibility and stop the wasteful use of paper for junk mail so trees can either be saved, or used to create more essential items such as toilet paper. Through AdMail, people can send a clear message that junk mail is no longer welcomed at their house. How do you feel about junk mail? Would you rather get paper ads, or digital ads?",
