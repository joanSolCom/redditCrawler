        "selftext": "Hi Reddit. My name is Dalesha Richardson and I have been showing how I go through life as a legally blind woman, along with my also legally blind boyfriend Manny, on my YouTube channel \"Dalesha's Life\" since the summer of 2016.\n\nIn 2016, when I decided to start this journey, my goal was to dispel the various misconceptions that surround legal blindness. I knew that traditional methods of teaching people were antiquated and didn't have the desired effect since those misconceptions and presumptions still existed back then.\n\nI thought that making fun and entertaining videos that showed how Manny and I did our day-to-day tasks would be a much better way to reach an audience that would normally not be reached through those traditional, antiquated teaching methods. Over the years, we've grown and in addition to our typical, day-to-day tasks, we've shared our experiences traveling, cooking, clothes shopping, and house hunting.\n\nIn addition to the above, there was another reason why I started this channel. The US government has a special category for people with legal blindness in almost every governmental program. This categorization says that if you can prove that you are legally blind, you are automatically eligible to receive assistance. If your federal government believes that you are incapable, why wouldn't the general public feel the same way?\n\nRegardless of the obstacles, Manny and I find alternative routes. Today, we continue to share our life together in the hopes that the preconceived assumptions of inability that most have of people like us will eventually disappear.\n\nOpening up a dialog is always helpful in situations of discomfort and uncertainty so please feel free to ask me (or Manny) anything!\n\nMy YouTube channel can be found here - [https://youtube.com/c/DaleshasLife](https://youtube.com/c/DaleshasLife)\n\nProof - [https://imgur.com/a/gBCUCwl](https://imgur.com/a/gBCUCwl)",
