For a couple of years, I never had anything to show for it. I mostly made small prototype games, or when I tried to make something bigger, I just lost interest. My game making journey didn't start properly until I found unity. It was super frustrating at first, but the idea of being able to make 3D games kept me going. I quickly found that 2D games were my passion (The only 3D game I actually ended up making was a walking simulator set in my school...). After making a sequel to one of my clickteam games, I decided I was ready for my first big/commercial project. I played a ton of indie games myself and I wanted to create something similar to those (Think Undertale, Owlboy etc.). After over a year of spending pretty much all my free time on this project, it's nearly done!\n\nAnyway, the game! It's a quirky story-driven puzzle platformer, where you switch between three animals: a walking fish, an arrogant eagle and a stuttering  reindeer! It's full of wacky characters and off-the-wall humor. There's plenty of puzzles, platforming, exploration, adventure game mechanics and a bunch of other stuff! To get a feel for it, check out the trailer or the demo! (both are linked below)\n\nGo ahead and ask me anything: About the game, how I made it, how I get motivation, and how I balance game-making with schoolwork (Spoiler alert: I do it poorly). I'll answer as much as I can :D\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/LifeIncGame/status/1258513728451932160](https://twitter.com/LifeIncGame/status/1258513728451932160)\n\nTrailer: [https://youtu.be/cgIiviGxWdU](https://youtu.be/cgIiviGxWdU)\n\nSteam Page (Here you can wishlist it or play the demo): [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1208220/Escape\\_from\\_Life\\_Inc/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1208220/Escape_from_Life_Inc/)\n\nEDIT: Alright, heading to bed now, thanks for the questions :) You can still ask stuff, I'll answer everything tomorrow!",
