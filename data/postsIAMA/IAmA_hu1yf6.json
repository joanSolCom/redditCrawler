We have devoted our clinical lives to applying DBT to a wide range of problems, including Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, anxiety, trauma, etc. Through our clinical work and research, we've learned about the many barriers to accessing this effective treatment, and have become passionate about broadly disseminating DBT skills to anyone who could benefit from them, as well as to therapists who do not have access to comprehensive DBT training. This realization led us to develop a DBT skills podcast called [Therapists in the Wild](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/therapists-in-the-wild/id1515633537), focused on teaching DBT skills in a fun and engaging way. Because we believe in leveling the playing field between therapist and client, each episode includes examples from our own lives, to model how these skills can be applied to a wide variety of problems.\n\nHere is some proof that we are, in fact, the Therapists in the Wild:\n\n1.

[Photo of us](https://imgur.com/a/Hbggw2v)\n\nAMA!\n\nEDIT: We so appreciate your questions, and **we cannot answer personal questions related to individual problems or concerns**. We are happy to answer questions about DBT in general, our podcast, etc. It would be unethical for us to weigh in on these personal concerns as we are not your therapists. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Due to the overwhelming response to this AMA, we will not be able to respond to any questions asked after 12:15pm EST on 7/19/2020. Please check out our podcast for more info on DBT and how to apply the skills to your own lives. Thank you all so much for your interest and engagement! :)",
