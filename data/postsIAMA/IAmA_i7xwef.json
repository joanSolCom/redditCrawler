Also I noticed an influx of mothers becoming engaged in politics and activism for the first time. This continues to be the case as we are living in a historic uprising calling for racial justice and see Black mothers in many cities leading the charge as well as solidarity in groups such as the \"Wall of Moms\" in Portland and elsewhere. \n\nHere in my home of Louisville, protests have been raging for months demanding justice for Breonna Taylor and although it's infuriating justice has been denied for so long, this moment feels very different and I think that is palpable throughout the country. \n\nIn my book, I discuss body image, toxic masculinity, feminism, self-care, and antiracism. I also shared some personal anecdotes about running for political office in an attempt to increase representation because women are underrepresented in office. Also, I recounted my experience of nearly dying after childbirth (0/10, would not recommend) and the overarching issue of maternal mortality in the United States. \n\nThis is my debut. Writing and publishing a book has been a lifelong dream fulfilled for me and I'm thrilled to be here. AMA!\n\nMy book appears to be sold out pretty much elsewhere, BUT there is actually inventory and if you order, you'll get it in a much quicker and more reasonable timeframe than the expected time given. \n\nIt is available:\nfrom your local independent bookstore,\n\nAmazon https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Resistance-Mothers-Practical-Activism/dp/1642503746/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1597169545&amp;sr=8-2\n\nBookshop https://bookshop.org/books/raising-the-resistance-a-mother-s-guide-to-practical-activism/9781642503746?aid=8867\n\nBarnes and Noble https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/raising-the-resistance-farrah-alexander/1136326757?ean=9781642503746\n\nand wherever books are sold!\n\nETA: Thank you all so much for taking the time to speak with you and contribute your thoughtful questions.
