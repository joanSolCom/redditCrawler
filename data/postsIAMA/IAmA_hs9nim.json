It is indirectly connected to Canada using an international bridge to the United States of America. Campobello’s place in history is largely tied to US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who referred to Campobello as his “beloved island” and spent summers there as a child.\n\nThere is no Provincially-owned or subsidized ferry vessel serving Campobello Island. East Coast Ferries Ltd. operates a seasonal vessel tied to the summer tourism season, but the reliability of the service has been the subject of scrutiny in recent years as the 2018 ferry season was abandoned completely due to vessel issues.\n\nResidents of Campobello Island face numerous unique challenges unlike challenges faced by any other Canadian. Islanders are the only Canadians forced to cross international borders to fuel up their cars, to obtain banking, reach governmental services, attend specialist appointments, and any number of practical services not available on the island. Domestic Canada Post mail is routinely inspected and scrutinized at the border on route to Campobello by US CBP, arbitrarily opened and sometimes seized if contents are questionable in the eyes of the agent.\n\nCampobello has difficulty obtaining Goods and Services, threatening existing Island establishments and the food security of the Island itself. Service technicians from many fields elect not to serve Campobello, citing difficulties in accessing the Island reliably. 86% of Island Residents feel a year-round ferry is “needed” or “very needed.” Campobello Island continues to be disproportionately hindered by policies at the border both during normal operations and COVID-19 operations in a State of Emergency.\n\nSince the 9/11 attacks and the corresponding increases in border restrictions, Campobello has watched its population decline by 35%, and a once healthy economy now lags behind the provincial average by over $6,000 per person. Deer Island to the north and Grand Manan to the south share similar economies based on fishing and tourism, and have been treading water in both demographics and have enjoyed year-round ferry connections to the mainland.\n\nThe only unique variable impacting Campobello Island compared to the other Fundy Isles is a total reliance on the International Border. The fact that Campobello has a complete reliance on the goodwill of a U.S. border patrol officer for access to Canada hurts the Island, with each additional measure prompting more families to leave the Island.\n\nIn a June 17th New Brunswick Legislature address announcing the return of a Gagetown Ferry, MLA Bruce Northrup proudly insisted that “Having reliable access to transportation infrastructure is critical for any community's long term viability and success”. Accessible Campobello and the residents of Campobello Island couldn’t agree more. Without reliable transportation infrastructure, Campobello has indeed suffered greatly, and currently has no elected voice in the Legislature.\n\nThe Accessible Campobello movement is dedicated to reversing two decades of decline. Beginning in 2017 as the Campobello Year Round Ferry Committee and reorganized as Accessible Campobello in the face of COVID-19 restrictions at the border, we continue to work at holding government accountable to protecting the constitutional rights of Canadian citizens on Campobello Island. Previous studies estimated direct Canadian economic benefit to be $2.5M/year, taking into account only the economic activity currently lost to the United States by residents’ necessity of travelling through the border. Actual economic benefit, including months added to the summer tourist season and increased access to mainland buyers for island fisheries, would likely be much higher though detailed studies have not been completed.\n\nWorking together with MLA David Coon and MP John Williamson, Accessible Campobello is dedicated to creating a year-round ferry connection to Campobello Island, opening pathways to building affordable housing, a robust, sustainable economy, improved connectivity and extended tourism opportunities are all unlocked when reliable transportation infrastructure is extended to all Islanders and mainlanders alike.\n\n2020 marks a pivotal moment in the rich history of Campobello Island, with representatives from municipal, provincial and federal governments all recognizing the dire need for improved transportation on Campobello Island. What is yet to be written is whether this is the turning point where governments work together to make Campobello Island sustainable, viable, and ready for a return to success, or whether Campobello Island is abandoned by the governments tasked with preserving access and mobility rights for all Canadian citizens.\n\n[https://stcroixcourier.ca/us-customs-and-border-protection-opening-canadian-mail-angers-some-island-residents/](https://stcroixcourier.ca/us-customs-and-border-protection-opening-canadian-mail-angers-some-island-residents/)\n\n[https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/even-in-covid-19-pandemic-one-canadian-community-has-no-choice-but-to-cross-the-u-s-border](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/even-in-covid-19-pandemic-one-canadian-community-has-no-choice-but-to-cross-the-u-s-border)",
