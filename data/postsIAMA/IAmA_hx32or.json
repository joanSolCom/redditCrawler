In the news this week, there has been a ton of coverage about potential Federal overreach when it comes to the protest occurring all over the country right now, and I wanted to stop by and share my own experience. \n\nA bit about me: I was not always a good person. I grew up in Houston, in a poverty stricken community, riddled with drugs and crime. I got caught up very early in gang related stuff, and by the age of 17 I was already in prison for a gang related fight. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Folks from my neighborhood almost never got an education; Most got prisoner numbers. I was one of the lucky ones who got an education IN prison. As I began to delve deeply into political science and history, an activist was born. Upon my release 7 years later, I was fully committed to using all of my time and energy to organize and try to fight so much of the injustice I had witnessed in the justice system. I organized all over the country, from Working on the Bernie Sanders campaign twice, in 8 states,  to working to ensure Maine's Ranked Choice voting effort proved successful. It is no overstatement to say my whole life revolved around trying to help people.\n\nI am also the father of a black son. The death of George Floyd hit me particularly hard. I dunno how common this knowledge is, but Mr. Floyd was a hero in this community.  He was a Football hero, who also was a member of DJ Screw's legendary Screwed Up Click. The music of Screw was such a huge part of Houston's culture. \n\nI was arrested three times during the George Floyd protest. They arrested me the first time trying to march onto the freeway. I was held for a day and released. HPD officers followed me around downtown houston for over 3 hours, until the rolled up on me with three unmarked police cars, re arrested me for no new crime, and enhanced my charges. I made bond, was out for three days, when the FBI kicked my door in 20 deep and arrested me again, again for no new crime. They kept trying to make me say I was antifa, and that there were hundreds of people who followed me. I am not antifa. I am the father of a black son who I dont even know how to explain why I am going through what I am going through to. \nI am currently on GPS monitoring (for a whopping 6 dollars a day!),  being forced to go to rehab for my \"marijuana addiction\", and wont know my future for awhile, so I just thought I would stop by and talk about it with you guys.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rQqTNe7",
