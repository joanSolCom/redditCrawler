You can read Emily Skopov's answers on everything from educational policy to her favorite sandwich by following the link above\n_____________________________________________\nI’m Emily Skopov and I’m running to represent the 28th legislative district of Pennsylvania because, like many of you, I expect more from  our government, and I know our families deserve it.  \n\n\nPeople have  lost faith that the values on which America was founded are being upheld  by our elected leaders. Too many of the policies coming out of  Harrisburg and Washington, D.C. don’t adequately solve the problems  facing hard-working Pennsylvanians. Many feel defeated and hopeless  about a system that seems corrupt and rigged. I’ve raised my children not to wait for someone else to solve a problem but to instead step forward to be part of a solution. And with all the problems demanding  attention in our communities, I knew it was time for me to step up and  run.\n\nI learned the value of hard work from my parents, a small  business owner and a public school teacher. I attended public school in my working class community and learned the importance of high-quality  public education to provide children with the tools and opportunities to build themselves a meaningful, rewarding and productive life. I worked at my dad’s neighborhood  drugstore and learned the critical skills of financial planning and budgeting;  valuing and investing in your employees, customers, and community;  contributing to and encouraging growth in the local economy; and how to  quickly adapt to changes in the market. My passion for, and commitment to, small businesses is rooted in their flexibility, responsibility, and  loyalty — they have to be there for their customers and accommodate  their needs through even the most difficult times.\n\nThis solid  working-class foundation allowed me to obtain degrees from Columbia  University and the University of California Los Angeles, and to have a  successful career as a screenwriter and director before moving to Marshall Township in Allegheny County with my husband and family a  decade ago. Since then, I have committed myself to my community by  volunteering in the North Allegheny Schools; starting a nonprofit that  prevents environmental waste and gets educational and art supplies into  the hands of those who need them most; being appointed to Marshall  Township’s Parks and Recreation Board; serving on the boards of the Northland Public Library Foundation, Braveheart Foundation, North  Allegheny Rowing Association, and as a founding member of our  synagogue’s social justice task force; and now, running for office to serve and advocate for this community both locally and in Harrisburg.\n\nI am running because my  community wasn’t being heard and their values weren’t being represented  in our state government. I believe that elected officials are public  servants and that it is a privilege to be the voice of our community. The political extremism that has paralyzed our government and turned neighbors against one another must end, and I  will restore common sense in the public interest to government.\n\nThis  is my second run for this seat. In 2018, I came within 9 points of then  Speaker of the House Mike Turzai, and he opted to retire rather than to  take this campaign on a second time and risk defeat. This district is the fastest Democratic-trending state house district in Pennsylvania. We have built a campaign that is now polling ahead of our opponent, and with  hard work and abundant support, we're going to flip this seat, and with it, the Pennsylvania legislature. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DONATE NOW &amp; help us flip this seat!](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/skopov2020) \\* [Website](https://www.electemily4pa.com/) \\* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ElectEmily4PA) \\* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmilySkopovPA) \\* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/emily4pa/) \\* [Volunteer](https://www.electemily4pa.com/ways-to-volunteer/)\n_________________________________________\n[AMA to begin at this link at 12:00 ET](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/ikw46r/im_emily_skopov_candidate_for_pennsylvania_house/)\n\nEDIT: AMA HAS CONCLUDED.
