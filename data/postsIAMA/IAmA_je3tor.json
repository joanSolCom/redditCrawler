I am also sorry to all those who asked questions I wasn't able to get to. We will be doing a Facebook Live in the near future to answer more questions, so if you'd like to know about that when it happens, keep an eye on the Yale Neurosurgery Facebook page at www.facebook.com/yneurosurgery. \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the questions so far! I have to step away for a bit to attend to meetings and clinics, but will continue answering when I have a pocket of time! \n\nHi! Happy National Spine Health Month! My name is Juan Bartolomei, MD and I’m a board-certified neurosurgeon at Yale School of Medicine and acting section chief of spine surgery. In 2013, I was named one of US News and World Report’s top doctors. I trained at Yale and in the UK, and I’m passionate about helping patients avoid surgery unless necessary. If surgery is necessary, I believe in making sure their procedure takes into account the whole spine and body to ensure better outcomes. \n\nDisclaimer: Answering your questions does not constitute a physician-patient relationship, so this does not replace medical advice from your physician.
