While doing that, I've also done lots of sound design for many of these games as well as audio coding, in-engine implementation work etc. So if you're interested in my experience of those things or my experience working with games in general, fire away.  I've worked in-house as well as freelance. I have my own freelance company with Nicklas Hjertberg, and we call our artist duo \"Two Feathers\".  We're based in Stockholm, Sweden.  The weather is nice, we had epic thunder this night -  it's an AMA so anything goes!\n\nI wanted to host an AMA here to help my two friends' indie-game and with their kickstarter, because I know they've worked with that so many years, and also because it honestly seems quite fun to do an AMA. It's an co-op action adventure game, and the kickstarter is running out of time. I got the mod pre-approval to include this link here to their page: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gofightfantastic/go-fight-fantastic-3-player-action-adventure](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gofightfantastic/go-fight-fantastic-3-player-action-adventure)\n\nI want to help them as they helped me in my career! Lina introduced me to the Hammerwatch developers, and that became my first real composing gig back in 2012. We're also writing music for the game, so there's personal stakes in it too of course.\n\nI'll try to answer questions until I pass out, with a dinner pause at some point, then come back tomorrow and see if there's anything else I can answer.\n\nLet's have some fun!\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/BjorkmanElvira/status/1277645701720219648](https://twitter.com/BjorkmanElvira/status/1277645701720219648)\n\nIf interesting:\n\nMy Merits (CV): [https://www.linkedin.com/in/elvirabjorkman/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elvirabjorkman/)\n\nTwo Feathers Website : [http://www.twofeathersstudio.com/](http://www.twofeathersstudio.com/)\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n**Useful info:**\n\nI got a question about gear, I thought that could be relevant to more people:\n\n*Speakers*: Neumann 120 A[https://www.thomann.de/se/neumann\\_kh\\_120\\_a.htm](https://www.thomann.de/se/neumann_kh_120_a.htm)Sound interface: Apogee Ensemble [https://www.thomann.de/se/apogee\\_ensemble\\_thunderbolt.htm](https://www.thomann.de/se/apogee_ensemble_thunderbolt.htm)\n\n*Headphones*: Sennheiser HD600.[https://www.thomann.de/se/sennheiser\\_hd\\_600\\_new\\_version\\_2019.htm](https://www.thomann.de/se/sennheiser_hd_600_new_version_2019.htm)\n\n*Microphone* *Pre-Amp*: Line Audio Pre-Amp [http://www.lineaudio.se/2MP.html](http://www.lineaudio.se/2MP.html)\n\n*Microphones*: Line Audio Omi1 and CM4[http://www.lineaudio.se/OM1.html](http://www.lineaudio.se/OM1.html)\\+ Neumann TLM67[https://www.thomann.de/se/neumann\\_tlm\\_67.htm](https://www.thomann.de/se/neumann_tlm_67.htm)\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nEdit: changed the order of paragraphs, as to do my my introduction first, since I think that might be the most relevant for people. The formatting was a bit weird.\n\nEdit: Just clarified the intro a bit, hopefully easier to read.\n\nEdit: 02:30 CEST,  Heading for bed - but I will keep a look out if there's any more questions tomorrow before ending it :)  I've had fun! Thank you for the questions!\n\nEdit: 12:10 CEST, I'm back keeping an eye out for the rest of the day! It's my last workday before vacation, so I have a few meetings etc, and some lunch to eat of course, but I will be around!\n\nEdit: 19:00 CEST, so I'm finally done with work for today and I saw some couple of questions I could answer! So since some people might still be interested in asking something, I'll stick around this evening until I go to bed, and that will be closing up shop  :)\n\nEdit: That's the end for this AMA! Thank you everyone for participating and asking fun and interesting questions :) I  think it went better than I expected! And thank you so much for taking a look at the KS! If there's anyone who finds this post and want to ask something, go for it and I might see it in a week or so.
