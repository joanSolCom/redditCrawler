        "selftext": "Hey Reddit, so I ended up having the surgery July 6th. It was a radical orchiectomy and they cut an incision around my pubic area. They pulled the left testicle out and all the giblets attached. Well I survived and have some updates:\n\nSperm Count: So I went to the sperm bank before the surgery and then a few weeks after ther surgery. I asked the doctor at the sperm bank to compare my results and he sent me back this \"What you want to look at is the Total Motility. Your first collection had a TOMO ( before we processed it) of 106. Whereas yesterday’s collection has a TOMO (pre-processing) of 60.9. The sperm counts were almost identical. But your first collection had a volume of 3.36 and you second collection had a volume of 1.82. But yes, it does make sense with the drop in volume and with one producing testicle it still looks like you have a decent amount of motile sperm cells.\"\n\nTestosterone: So before the surgery I took a testosterone test and it came out to 461. I started feeling really tired and had zero energy. I was worried that just having one working testicle was leaving me a less than average amount of testosterone. So I went back and got a new testosterone test and the results came back at a 500! So that was some good news, righty tighty came in clutch and picked up the slack and then some!\n\nCancer: So there was a 2 inch seminole cancer in my left testicle. My doctor said if had to choose a cancer to get it would be that one. They wouldn't let me keep it, I asked!\n\nRadiation: My doctor recommended getting radiation. He said if I didn't there's a 30% chance the cancer could come back in my lymph nodes or my lungs. However if I do radiation, then that chance drops to below 5%. I went to my first radiation appointment last week and it wasn't fun. Had to put my scrotum in a lead ball to protect it from the rays. It was heavy and kept pinching my skin. Then the doctor gave me three little tattoos, one on each hip and then one near my pubic area. It was so that the machine could be calibrated to my body exactly every time. I have to do this for the 4-5 weeks and then i'm DONE!!!! I will be a regular guy with a little less junk in my hood!\n\nSo those are the big updates, ask me anything! Also from my last post a lot of guys reached out about their own ball issues and I couldn't reply to you all. However here is my best advice, if you go to a family doctor and he says you shouldn't worry about it and you go home and are still worried about it; GO TO A UROLOGIST! A family doctor cupped my balls gently and said it was just veins but a urologist went in there and moved those veins and really grabbed the cancer by the balls!\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/bO4ZQJV",
