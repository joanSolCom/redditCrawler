About two-thirds of them involve an opioid.\n\nThe opioid crisis has shaped America in the 21st century. Many of the people who became addicted to opioids were first prescribed the painkillers by doctors.\n\nIn a joint investigation, the Financial Times and PBS series Frontline talked to several former employees about life inside the pharmaceutical company Insys, whose bosses were the first executives to be arrested for their role in America’s opioid epidemic.\n\nIn 2012, the company’s fentanyl spray, Subsys, was approved for cancer patients with bursts of pain that were already tolerant to opioids. However, the majority of prescriptions were for patients who did not even have cancer.\n\nTo get doctors to prescribe its fentanyl spray, Insys crossed into illegality. While it’s common for drugmakers to pay speakers’ fees to doctors with the understanding that they will recommend their product to peers at educational events, Insys made it clear that they expected more prescriptions in return for their money.\n\nThe company’s tactics demonstrated an extraordinary case of explicit bribery to prescribe a potent opioid — and an unusual example of government agencies rallying together to prosecute executives. But the case also exposed flaws in how the US regulates drugs. The system makes it hard to catch bad actors — whether individuals or entire companies — before they devastate lives.\n\nWe are Hannah Kuchler, the Financial Times US pharma and biotech correspondent, and Tom Jennings, a documentary producer for PBS, and we are here to chat about our investigation.\n\nHere are some of the latest stories we’ve published about the Insys case and the opioid crisis in the US:\n\n - [Opioid executive admits to ‘no morals’ ahead of prison term](https://www.ft.com/content/eae603a4-a369-4801-a4cc-06232898a34f) \n - [How Insys Therapeutics Bribed Doctors and Made Millions](https://www.pbs.org/video/how-insys-therapeutics-bribed-doctors-and-made-millions-sdhm/) \n - [US relaxes rules for opioid substitutes during lockdowns | Free to read](https://www.ft.com/content/367813b4-bd55-4d33-b914-d59b61371ff6)\n\nProof: \n\n - https://i.redd.it/s2gxoragqq551.jpg\n - https://i.redd.it/3bdrepthqq551.jpg\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for joining us.
