Everest Expedition.\n\nFootage Here: [http://theporterfilm.com/](http://theporterfilm.com/)\n\nThe project was a bit of a capstone to anotherwise out-of-my-mind five-year millennial stint to tackle the craziest adventures on the planet: from living in a Brazilian Favela with a family I met on the street to swearing to noble silence in a Himalaya Temple, I eventually got so manic that I raised enough money — because I had no money of my own — to film one of these immersive projects. And this is what came about.\n\n*The Porter* began as a test of will. An effort to see just how far I could push myself before collapsing. And to do so, with obviously the hardest job on the planet. But then I actually did it. I actually slept on the ground, ate only rice, carried 100 kilos and completed an expedition only to cry in a closet afterwards, crawl into a bed and reflect on the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of other porters that have done, are doing and will do more than what I did, 20x a year. And that most of them are so underapaid that they can't even do anything else.\n\nSo, it definitely changed me in a pretty extreme way. But not at first. It took me a few months just to realize that, I, a random traveler, now had the only real proof of this injustice. And so, I tried to make a film.\n\nI sit here today at my computer with a couple of empty pasta bowls beside me in a room that I've rented out from 2-weeks to 2 weeks, posting an AMA to Reddit with the hope that others might want to share this story and spread awarenes for the Porter plight too. I am not a filmmaker. I am not a marketer. I am just a \"me\" with an experience. And a mesage I think should be shared.\n\nHopefully this film can help raise some awareness for the improvement of Porters’ salaries on Everest.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything.
