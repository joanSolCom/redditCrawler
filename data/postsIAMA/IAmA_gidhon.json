My goal is to bring the light and language of Recovery to the world and share my experience strength and Hope. I come from generational addiction.  My mother died of alcoholism when I was six. The impression she left in my life inspired me to reach out to women who suffer from addiction and women with children. I wanted to help bridge the gap from troubled lives and help women become independent and self-sufficient. Today, my dream has become a reality with Mary Hall Freedom House (MHFH), named in memory of my mother. Through a community of sisterhood, I coach women to free themselves from the past and live every day for the future. Over 10,000 women and children have achieved recovery through Mary Hall Freedom House since founded in 1996, by empowering them to end the cycle of generational addiction, poverty, and homelessness. I'm excited to share news about the new documentary, HOPE VILLAGE, which premieres TODAY, MAY 12th at 8 PM (PST). Here’s the Film trailer: \nhttps://youtu.be/Sluf5uBQufk\n \nIn the film, I share how the death of my mother Mary due to alcoholism complications launched my journey of self-discovery. I sank to the depths of self-destruction with drugs and alcohol only to rise from the ashes and use what I learned to help other women in their own recovery. The film is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083VPRSWD/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl). Also, in light of the new normal, we find ourselves in due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Sunwise Media is hosting a FREE live stream premiere party and online workshops for National Substance Abuse Prevention Week. We are inviting all treatment centers, schools, and individuals in recovery and their loved ones to join us online today, May 12th. \n\nVisit www.hopevillageproject.com to access the link and invite code. I look forward to answering your questions today, Ask me Anything!\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/1wz6pnc3gfx41.jpg",
