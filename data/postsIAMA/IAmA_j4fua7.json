I’m running because we are moving closer to an environmentally-driven collapse, and I want to help stop it—or at least insulate ourselves from the coming disaster. Shoutout to my buddies at r/collapse and r/environment.\n\nI think many of y’all understand the danger we’re in: [the UN IPCC said](https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/)—2 years ago—we have 12 years to take serious action to mitigate climate change. As usual, we did nothing, and are risking rising sea levels which threaten to displace hundreds of millions (billions?) of people over the next 50 years, worsening drought and desertification in parts of the world, worsening flooding in other parts of the world, unprecedented waves of global migration, food and water shortages, and [increased instability across the earth](https://climateandsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/implications-of-climate-change-for-us-army_army-war-college_2019.pdf)—and that’s not to mention the not-totally-unrelated pandemic and Depression 2.0 which has erupted worldwide, or the invasive species and changing climate patterns that undermine our fragile ecosystems.\n\nYou don’t have to be an environmental expert to learn the truth and try to make a difference. I am not a climate scientist; I’m a teacher, officially. I’ve taught a bunch of subjects (Latin, World Cultures, American History, Economics, Leadership, U.S. Government, ESL) across several schools in the United States (in Connecticut and Mass), China (in Xiamen and Chengdu), and Saudi Arabia (in Abha). \n\nI was in China (Feb 2018—July 2019) when the US-China trade war began, when Xi Jinping wrote his name into the constitution and removed term limits for himself, and when Trump met Kim Jong-Un (in SE Asia but whatever). Basically the twilight period of Americans in China; I took the hints and got out, coincidentally a few months before COVID-19 hit. (I also got to meet and interview China’s first climate striker, shoutout to [Howey Ou](https://twitter.com/howey_ou).) After China, I taught at a university in Abha, Saudi Arabia, for a year (during which Saudi had its oil war, opened up tourist visas for visitors, and then began a strict 3-month lockdown), returning home in May on a U.S. repatriation flight, and then declared my candidacy in June 2020, very late in the process—with fewer than 2 months to get my name on the ballot.\n\nThis is not the first time I’ve run for office, but it is the biggest office I’ve sought. 4 years ago, in 2016, I ran for (and lost) Massachusetts State Senate, when I was just 24 years old. Earlier in that year, I also hitchhiked across the USA (from DC to LA, in March) in 17 glorious days; I later wrote and published a book about the experience, [Hitchhike America](https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhike-America-Jon-Lott/dp/1732583102/), which didn’t sell well. Buy a copy today!\n\nAnyway, it’s one month to Election Day, and some people are voting already. There is no Republican in my race (the GOP resistance in Massachusetts has pretty much fallen apart, except for the Governor) so this is one of a very very few number of Congressional races with an independent vs. one major-party candidate (Congressman Stephen Lynch, whom I respect). [Here's the campaign website!](https://www.lott2020.com/)\n\nAMA about the campaign, living and working overseas, hitchhiking, climate, politics, Seinfeld, or anything else.\n\n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrJonLott)\n\n[Follow me on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/mrjonlott/)\n\n**My Proof:** [https://twitter.com/MrJonLott/status/1312397566957490177](https://twitter.com/MrJonLott/status/1312397566957490177)\n\nEdit: more proof: https://imgur.com/smsReS9\n\nLast Edit: I'm gonna call an end to this AMA.  It's disappointing that few people here wanted to discuss the upcoming climate collapse, which is why I'm running for office in the first place.  It seems like the mob ran away with this one. If you are interested in my other political positions, or arrived too late to ask questions, or want to know more about living and working overseas, you can reach out to me on Twitter or through my campaign website.
