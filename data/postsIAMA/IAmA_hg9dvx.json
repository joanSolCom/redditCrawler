I was in charge of calling parents to get info, setting up, assigning other hosts to ones I couldnt do, etc.  I also did all other work in the restaurant (kitchen, register, Gameroom, etc.).  I was close friends w my bosses, had a great working relationship with the district manager, and met the VP.   Edit- I left at the end of November before they filed for bankruptcy\n\nWith the bankruptcy announcement I figured I’d do an AMA, since it’s kinda topical and people might have unanswered questions from childhood\n\nAnd I’m just gonna get this one out of the way: of course they don’t salvage and reheat slices.  The business operates as a restaurant first business, doing something like that would get them shut down so quick.  If the pizza were to have gone back in the oven, it would have burned guaranteed (we warn people before they request theirs get reheated if it was left idle on their table for a while).  It has an uneven shape because it’s hand stretched dough, which allows for occasionally uneven circles, and the pies get cut with a type of rolling machete, which can often warp the slices if done fast (like in a Saturday rush).  Everything is made to order.  Dough is even prepared and made in house\n\nLightening edit- I can add more proof if needed, it would just require me digging my old name tag up which I just didn’t feel like doing rn cuz I’m cleaning and don’t want to make a mess unnecessarily\n\nEdit 2- wow ok this got more popular Than I thought it would.  I have a date in a few hours but I’ll just keep answering questions til then and then maybe after\n\nEdit 3- ok I’ve answered every question in my inbox that wasn’t about Shane Dawson or fights or the play place (stuff that was frequently asked) so I’m gonna go ahead and mute notifications on this post for now because I have to get ready for my date now.  I’ll check back in later tonight to see if there’s anymore unique/more personally related questions, but if not, I had fun!  Thanks for helping me while away my afternoon, everyone :))",
