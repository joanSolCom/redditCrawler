I'm Eric Rauchway, distinguished professor of history at the University of California, Davis. I research and write about the Great Depression and the New Deal, and my most recent book is [*Winter War: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the First Clash Over the New Deal*](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/eric-rauchway/winter-war/9780465094585/), about the critical period between the 1932 election and Franklin Roosevelt's first inauguration on March 4, 1933. Here's the publisher's blurb:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;When Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in the 1932 election, they represented not only different political parties but vastly different approaches to the question of the day: How could the nation recover from the Great Depression?  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;As historian Eric Rauchway shows in Winter War, FDR laid out coherent, far-ranging plans for the New Deal in the months prior to his inauguration. Meanwhile, still-President Hoover, worried about FDR’s abilities and afraid of the president-elect’s policies, became the first comprehensive critic of the New Deal. Thus, even before FDR took office, both the principles of the welfare state, and reaction against it, had already taken form.  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;Winter War reveals how, in the months before the hundred days, FDR and Hoover battled over ideas and shaped the divisive politics of the twentieth century.\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm game to answer questions about that time, the Depression (principally in the United States) and the New Deal more generally, to some extent how we remember it and why, and related matters. As it happens I have an [op ed in the *Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/roosevelts-new-deal) on the subject today.
