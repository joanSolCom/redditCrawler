Since its founding in 1919—a time when the Middle East was called the Orient—the OI has pioneered innovative excavations and comprehensive dictionary projects that serve as cultural encyclopedias of ancient civilizations. The OI Museum houses some 350,000 artifacts, excavated mainly by OI archaeologists, and includes a comprehensive archive that documents our fieldwork and other research. Together, the OI Museum collections comprise one of the best resources in the world for the ancient Middle East, allowing us to understand, reveal, and protect the past. Learn about the OI (https://oi100.uchicago.edu) and browse the collection of artifacts and archival materials that make up the OI Museum collection (http://oi-idb.uchicago.edu). \n\nHere’s just a few recent features on the OI and the work of the OI Museum…  \n\n“OI marks 100 years of discovery in ancient Middle East”: https://news.uchicago.edu/story/oi-marks-100-years-discovery-ancient-middle-east\n\n\"For its centennial, Oriental Institute weds ancient artifacts with contemporary art”: https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/oriental-institute-weds-ancient-artefacts-with-cutting-edge-contemporary-art\n\n “The Oriental Institute has a 100th birthday makeover wish — to no longer be Chicago’s ‘hidden gem’”: https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-ent-oriental-museum-chicago-100-years-0922-20190919-hx7jj5lzezdb3ngocj4htwv65q-story.html\n\n“Ancient Persian artifact nearly 2,500 years old returns to Oriental Institute”: https://news.uchicago.edu/story/ancient-persian-artifact-nearly-2500-years-old-returns-oriental-institute\n\n“Artist reimagines ancient Middle Eastern artifact in vivid color”: https://news.uchicago.edu/story/artist-reimagines-ancient-middle-eastern-artifact-vivid-color\n\nTo celebrate #AskACurator Day, we’re here to answer your questions.
