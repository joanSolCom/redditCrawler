We've added new products and new functionality since then and we figure it'd be nice to spend some time with you. We don't have any announcements today but based on our weekly Live Streams we realize you still have a lot of questions about the team and the product, so here is your chance! (Note, we don't discuss future plans.) Here are some topics that might get your curiosity flowing:\n\n* SketchUp and LayOut Functionality &amp; Workflows\n* Extensions and Add-Ons\n* Usage Recommendations\n* History of the product and team\n* SketchUp Mascot\n* Soundtrack while we work\n* What is that thing by Aaron's left hand in the live streams\n* The list goes on, feel free to expand it!\n\nWe hope to see you on May 28th at Noon SketchUp Time (also known as Noon Mountain Time, where we are based.)\n\n[https://twitter.com/SketchUp/status/1265692259497975808](https://twitter.com/SketchUp/status/1265692259497975808)\n\nWell, that's mostly a wrap... the team has returned to their socially isolated corner of the world, but we'll still keep an eye on questions for a bit if they roll in. Thanks everyone for joining us, some great questions here!",
