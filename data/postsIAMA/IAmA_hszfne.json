AMA!\n\n\n**Full intro**\nHi you all! [Lonni](http://lonnibesancon.me) here. With my colleagues, we conducted the first empirical study on the use of colour manipulation and stylization to make surgical images and videos easier to watch. While aversion to such stimuli is natural, it limits the ability of many people to satisfy their curiosity, educate themselves and make rational decisions. We have selected a diverse set of image processing techniques and tested them on surgeons and people who are not exposed to such stimuli on a daily basis (non-specialists/lay people). Through this study, we have found a technique that is particularly effective in reducing the shocking aspect of such images while preserving the initial information of the image.\nBased on this result, we developed a google chrome plugin (Arkangel, in reference to Black Mirror) to automatically process any image that could be shocking.\n\nAn illustration of the technique that seems to work best is available [here, in the header](https://www.aviz.fr/visualcensoring) (don't worry it's all safe for work)\n\n\nWe hope that this kind of technology can be generalized to help in many ways:\n\n- helping non-specialists to inform themselves (e.g., on wikipedia)\n- helping online content moderators who [have to deal with illegal and offensive content all the time](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa)\n- help police officers who have to go through the gory files of some criminals\n- helping animal protection associations to disseminate, for example, images of slaughterhouses\n- help newspaper editors, who sometimes [have to go through hundreds of war or accident photos to choose the image that will accompany the article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/23/graphic-content-photographs-too-upsetting-to-publish-gaza-mh17-ukraine)\n- ...\n\nWe also consider many other scenarios that we explain in this [TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/pDHomZ8FEoU), including how we could use this in augmented reality for example.\nThe plugin and the latest information about the project are available on the project page: https://www.aviz.fr/visualcensoring\n\nWe also announce some news on twitter, don't hesitate to [follow me](https://twitter.com/lonnibesancon) @lonnibesancon\n\nThe proof for this AMA is available [here](https://i.imgur.com/CL3fqZS.jpg) and just for fun, the Arkangel version is available [here](https://i.imgur.com/lIApFye.jpg) (if you think my smile is a little bit too creepy on the first image, that will help).\n\nHere is the Open Access link to the two scientific articles published on the subject. They talk about the trade-off between the shock of the image and the fact that we must keep the details visible. \n\n- [Paper 1](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01795744/file/Besancon_2018_RAR.pdf)\n- [Paper 2](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02381513v2/document)\n\n\nI think I've said it all! I hope to have interesting exchanges with all of you r/IAmA! So… AMA!\n\n**Edit: Obvious typo in the title: I meant 911 not 9/11**\n\n**Edit2: It's 3:18 am and I need a short rest before answering all other questions you might have. Feel free to keep posting and commenting, I'll be back very soon**\n\n**Edit3: I'm back :)**",
