Although the backgrounds and experiences of our team all greatly differs, many of us were former employees from some of the larger debt relief companies in the United States — that decided we could create a better debt relief company and actually do right by US consumers. Consequently, [**The Debt Relief Company**](https://www.thedebtreliefcompany.com) was founded to help increase financial awareness and financial literacy in the United States and help struggling consumers take back control from high interest credit card debt.\n\nTowards the end of last year, we came to you with an IAmA discussing credit card debt, credit, financial planning, etc. — all focused on the longer-term future. Some Redditor's previously asked whether the 2020s would be like the roaring 1920s (we didn’t think so —as the odds were in favor of some exogenous event impacting the long-running 10 year + bull market and expansion). Back then, a typical conversation with clientele was focused around what the next 3-5 years are going to look like and how best to prepare for the future. However, with the emergence of the novel coronavirus, all of this has suddenly changed. Our daily conversations since mid-March have been focused around what the next 3-5 months are going to look like for our clients as opposed to the previous longer-term outlook. With the increasing amount of financial hardships being claimed across the US due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our daily topics of conversation have shifted towards adjusting budgets due to a decrease in pay, consolidating debts, moving around due dates, postponing financial expenditures, and prioritizing what needs to be paid immediately… all stemming from the same question, “What should I do right now?”.\n\nThe following is an excerpt to provide a little more insight into what’s currently going on in the US credit and financial industry today. One of our clients (that successfully completed The DRC Program a while back) recently called their bank to renegotiate a new payback as they charged $20,000 worth of business expenses on a credit card. Since New York state mandated all non-essential business to put operations on hold, the small business owner would not be able to sell their inventory in the short term until their business was allowed to re-open. So, the individual reached out to their bank looking to acquire some kind of payment relief or assistance. How did the creditor accommodate might you be wondering? Well, the bank offered to lower their interest rate down from 17.99% to 9.99% for 6 months. While that may seem somewhat helpful to someone unknowing, it really isn’t much assistance given the magnitude of the situation and the fact the individual is a small business owner. The client is still accruing interest during this time and the actions taken by their bank left a lot to be desired. The individual will still be required to make timely payments on all accounts and considering their business is effectively shut down for the foreseeable future, they will have great difficulty making the monthly payment. Bear in mind, this client was strictly using the credit card as a revolving line of credit for inventory expenses, in which the bill was completely paid and covered at the end of each month. So, it’s safe to say banks really aren’t looking to help consumers like they should be, and in all honesty, this was to be expected.\n\n[**The Debt Relief Program**](https://www.thedebtreliefcompany.com/the-drc-program)\n\n[FB Reddit Proof](https://www.facebook.com/473906349681181/posts/739612949777185/?d=n)\n\n[Twitter Reddit Proof](https://twitter.com/DebtReliefCo/status/1250424325842169867?s=20) \n\n[Linkedin Reddit Proof](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6656190079100350465)",
