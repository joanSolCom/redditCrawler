Rachel will pop in to answer more of them over the next couple of days. \n\n\nThis global crisis will fundamentally change how we think, behave, and consume, it requires enormous amounts of trust.

How do we keep innovating when there are so many unknowns? I am a leading expert and author on trust in the modern world. As the first Trust Fellow at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, I aim to challenge and change the way people think about trust and related topics such as power, influence, truth and beliefs. I’ve written two critically acclaimed books, [What’s Mine is Yours](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Whats-Mine-Yours-Collaborative-Consumption/dp/0007395914) and [Who Can You Trust?](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Can-You-Trust-Technology/dp/024129617X/) My [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/speakers/rachel_botsman) have been viewed more than 4 million times.
