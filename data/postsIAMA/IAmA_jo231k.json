If they fall in line for Joe Biden, then he'll win the White House. Biden has pulled into the lead in Wisconsin and Michigan, but final counts are still hours, or even days, away.\n\nWe're also still waiting for results in Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Alaska.\n\n(Check the latest live numbers at [politico.com/results](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/) as they continue to roll in.

She’s also the co-author of the book “When Women Vote” and is the former Director of Elections for Denver, Colorado.\n\n**Justin Levitt** is an expert on constitutional law and the law of democracy and a professor at LMU Loyola Law School. He served from 2015-17 as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice, helping to lead the Civil Rights Division’s work on redistricting, voting rights, and employment discrimination, and supported activity on more than 120 cases (including 20 in the U.S. Supreme Court). Before entering academia, Levitt worked at several nonpartisan nonprofits and served several presidential campaigns, including as the National Voter Protection Counsel in 2008, helping to ensure that tens of millions of eligible citizens could vote and have those votes counted.
