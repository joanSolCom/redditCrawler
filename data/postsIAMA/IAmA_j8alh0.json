I’m in charge of information security for First Look Media (the parent company of the Intercept, where I also do [investigative journalism and write privacy/security guides](https://theintercept.com/staff/micah-lee/). I’ve been working in journalist security since 2013 when I [helped facilitate](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/28/smuggling-snowden-secrets/) the Snowden leak. I’m involved in organizations like [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) and Distributed Denial of Secrets, and I also write a lot of [open source code](https://github.com/micahflee). \n\nHere are some of my recent projects that I'm happy to talk about:\n\n* I’ve been digging into [BlueLeaks](https://theintercept.com/collections/blueleaks/), a breach of hundreds of gigs of data from terribly secured US fusion centers and other US law enforcement websites.\n\n* I’ve been hard at work on a new version of [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/), a tool that lets you do cool things with Tor onion services like share files, turn your computer into an anonymous dropbox, quickly and easily host static darkweb sites, and soon host temporary, ephemeral chat rooms where nothing gets logged.\n\n* I’ve been running an antifascist Twitter privacy service called [Semiphemeral](https://semiphemeral.com/) that automates deleting old tweets, likes, and DMs, but with the flexibility to choose what not to delete. There’s also a slightly-harder-to-use [open source version](https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral).\n\n* I recently made an open source tool called [Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/) that uses docker containers to convert sketchy Office documents or PDFs into PDFs that you can be sure are safe, basically a digital version of printing a document and then rescanning it.\n\nAlso, this is probably more on my mind than anything else: Our civilization is crumbling, a plague is raging, climate disasters are getting more frequent and worse and science deniers have all the political power, police are murdering innocent black people and then beating activists in the streets for protesting them (not to mention surveilling their phones and social media), and in the US white supremacists are intimidating voters and threatening civil war. I don’t have solutions, but I’d love to use my technical expertise in any way it can be most helpful.\n\nAMA!\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/micahflee/status/1314706583901949953\n\n\n**[Please click this link to join Micah Lee’s IAMA on r/Privacy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/j89kpo/im_micah_lee_director_of_infosec_for_the/)**",
