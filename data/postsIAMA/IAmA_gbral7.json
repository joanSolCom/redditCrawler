We have over 160 engineers, designers, business professionals and more working together to be the first college students to launch a liquid bi-propellant rocket into space by 2021.\n\nOur Principal Launch Vehicle Engineer, Vishnu, is hosting an **AMA/takeover of our Instagram account (@TexasRocketLab) TODAY with a special live session from 5-5:30pm** CST. If you have any interest in rocketry, the New Space Industry, or how to get more involved in STEM, he’s got the knowledge! We’ll be reposting some of the questions and his responses below. Comment what you wanna know about rocketry and catch the Instagram Live to see your question answered! We’ll post the full video here later, just in case you miss it.  \n\n\nVishnu Selvakumar is a third-year aerospace engineering major at The University of Texas at Austin. Vishnu is the current Launch Vehicle Principal Engineer for the Texas Rocket Engineering Lab, where he manages the design, build, and test of the lab’s Halcyon launch vehicle, **with experience working at Firefly Aerospace**\\*.\\* He joined TREL in January 2019 as the Structures Lead before assuming his current role. Some of his core engineering interests are human space exploration, completing new projects from scratch, and figuring out why the Rockets play so much iso-ball. Vishnu has also had the opportunity to complete an internship at Firefly Aerospace and will be back there this Summer supporting their propulsion team in the launch of their first rocket, Alpha.  \n\n\nIn addition to TREL, Vishnu was also a member of the Longhorn Marching Band and has played the trumpet since 6th grade\\*.\\* Vishnu grew up playing basketball, football, and cricket in the suburbs of Cypress, TX. He enjoys following Houston sports teams like the Rockets, Texans, and …Astros (H-Town, hold it down!!!) and has been trying to find a way to replace Lewis Hamilton of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team since the beginning of quarantine. Until he finally gets on the grid though, you’ll get to see him make an appearance on his TREL Instagram takeover.  \n\n\nAsk Vishnu Anything!!!!  \n\n\nVerification: [https://twitter.com/texasrocketlab/status/1256038027060797441](https://twitter.com/texasrocketlab/status/1256038027060797441)",
