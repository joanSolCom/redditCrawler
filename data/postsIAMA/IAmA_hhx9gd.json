You can read or watch what the study found and ask us any questions you have!\n\n**Background:** Approximately 75% of people with long-term pain conditions, such as  arthritis, believe weather affects their pain. Many report pain is made  worse by the cold. Others report pain is made worse by the warm. And  others report damp or rainy weather aggravates pain.\n\n**What we did:** To understand which  weather conditions affect pain most, we conducted a 15-month smartphone study called “Cloudy with a Chance of Pain”. Over 13,000 UK residents living with chronic pain downloaded our app, where they could record their daily pain intensity. At the same time, their smartphones' GPS locations would link to local weather data.We then compared, for each participant, what was different in the weather when they had a particularly painful day (compared to a day without such pain increases).\n\n**What we found:** We found that days with higher  humidity, lower pressure, and stronger winds are more likely associated with high pain days. We did not find any link between temperature and pain or rain and pain.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are Dr Anna Beukenhorst and Dr Jamie Sergeant of The University of Manchester. We went looking for the answer to the age old question of how the weather affects pain, as part of our research project, ‘Cloudy with a Chance of Pain’. Today we are here to answer any questions you have about our research!\n\nRead the paper here: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0180-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0180-3)\n\nOur participants shared their stories here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6by\\_IoVwRk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6by_IoVwRk)\n\nSee BBC Breakfast's 2-minute summary here: [https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1187269996474437633](https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1187269996474437633)\n\nLearn more about *Cloudy with a Chance of Pain* on our website: [https://cloudywithachanceofpain.com/](https://cloudywithachanceofpain.com/)\n\nRead more on the website of [Versus Arthritis](https://www.versusarthritis.org/news/2019/october/new-research-indicates-links-between-weather-and-arthritis-pain/), who funded our study, or on the [Medical Research Council](https://mrc.ukri.org/news/blog/smartphones-for-healthcare-research-data-at-our-fingertips/) or watch the take of [the Weather Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEUWCd1qko).\n\n  \n**15:30 BST - EDIT:** Thank you all so much for your questions!
