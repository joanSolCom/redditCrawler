        "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",
