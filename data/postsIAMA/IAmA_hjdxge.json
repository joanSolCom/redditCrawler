I’m a fourth-generation Michigander and lifelong Rochester area resident. Following my passion for diplomacy, I studied International Relations in James Madison College at Michigan State University. \n\nI’ve served in the Majority Whip’s Office in the Michigan Legislature, as a political analyst in Spain with the U.S. State Department, and as a national security analyst for Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin. I went to Georgetown University for my masters degree in Foreign Service, specializing in global politics and security. I am trained to work with people from all backgrounds to come together to find the solutions we need.\n\nMichigan has long been the poster child of America’s middle class, building everything from the American Dream to the Arsenal of Democracy. But more than a decade of bad governance in Lansing has allowed our education system to become the DeVos family’s personal laboratory, and degraded public policy has resulted in disasters like Flint’s water crisis and our terrible infrastructure. It was a frustrated people that Donald Trump seized on and won by only 10,704 (0.23%) votes. All eyes are on Michigan in 2020, and the best way to improve Democratic turnout will be with strong candidates running up and down the ballot. Michigan did not see this level of Democratic commitment at the state level in 2016, but by investing now in on-the-ground candidates like myself, we can make sure that 2020 is different.\n\nThis seat is one of the top four targeted in the state to flip from red to blue this November. It has long been a GOP stronghold, but the district has dramatically shifted in recent years towards being a flippable seat. If we can flip this seat, we can take back the majority in the Michigan State House, giving Governor Whitmer at least one chamber in Lansing to move forward in making the changes we want to see in Michigan.\n\nI firmly believe that Michigan works best when Michiganders are working together. But, the unresponsive and divisive politics in Lansing have deprived Michiganders of common sense solutions to the real issues that we face and common investments in the future we all hope for, like fixing our crumbling infrastructure, securing safe drinking water all over the state, ensuring safety in our communities, and increasing our funding and support for public education. My experience in both state and federal government, my education, and my commitment to public service have all prepared me to bring the kind of collaborative leadership we need to Lansing.\n\nMichiganders need someone in Lansing who will work across differences to find the pragmatic, common-sense solutions we need to improve our communities and state. I’m running to make government work for Michiganders. We need to trust that our water is safe, that our roads are reliable, and that our children have a safe environment in which to learn. I will use diplomacy to bring about the best solutions for all Michiganders, and I will be proud to represent my home in Lansing. I hope I can count on your vote in the August 4th Primary!\n\n[This AMA is happening on another sub, click here to ask questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/hiqtfd/hello_im_brendan_johnson_a_proud_democrat_running/)",
