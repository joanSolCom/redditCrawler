But, as we’ve all seen, this pandemic has led to a number of changes within the education system. As such, this year will be the [first Online Version of our workshop](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinqueprep.com%2Fcollegeworkshop2020), and - in addition to the usual itinerary - will address how prospective students may be impacted by COVID-19. My colleagues from different schools around the country (Stanford, Vanderbilt, Rochester, DePaul, among others) will be attending the workshop to share their advice with students.\n\nAs it is our first digital workshop, I am excited to share my knowledge with parents and students across the states!
