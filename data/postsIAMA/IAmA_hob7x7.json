We have over 200 engineers, designers, business professionals and more working together to be the first college students to launch a liquid bi-propellant rocket into space by 2021.\n\nOur Director of Operations, Priyal, is hosting an AMA/takeover of our Instagram account (@TexasRocketLab) TOMORROW with a special live session from 5-5:30pm CST. \n\nIf you have any interest in rocketry, the New Space Industry, or how to get more involved in STEM, she’s got the knowledge! We’ll be reposting some of the questions and her responses below. Comment what you wanna know about rocketry and catch the Instagram Live to see your question answered!\n\nHere is a message from Priyal:\n\nHi there! I’m Priyal Soni and I’m a rising junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Business. I joined the Texas Rocket Engineering Lab (TREL) when I was a freshman in college and I worked on the Recovery team. \n\nI spent a lot of time working on deployment systems, aerodynamics calculators, and general research and design regarding recovery systems. After a year working as a recovery engineer, I became TREL’s Director of Operations!\n\nI work with all the engineering and test teams as well as the business team to integrate all of the systems and get ready for launch! I primarily do a lot of program management, personnel work, recruiting, and more. \n\nAsk Priyal anything!\n\nVerification: https://mobile.twitter.com/texasrocketlab/status/1281331720726421507",
