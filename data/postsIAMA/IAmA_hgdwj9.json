I run an indie studio called [Raconteur Games](http://raconteurgames.com) (we're currently making a [game about a lost dog](https://thedoggame.com)), have experience starting a few different businesses as well as doing consulting work, and also have experience in industrial AR/VR for safety and training.\n\nI recently launched a self-help book that's desperately trying *not* to be one, Not The Worst Book You Could Read (available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Worst-Book-Could-Read/dp/B08B7H3NDB/) if that's your thing). Throughout my journey doing all of the above things, people have remarked that I have a good outlook on life, so the book is my attempt to share that with you to help you on your own journey! Apparently it's funny, so hey, maybe you'll exhale lightly while reading it. I managed to get Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, to be quoted in it so if you are concerned that someone smart is involved, there you go!\n\nAMA about self-publishing your own book, what it's like making and shipping games, or anything about starting a business.\n\nI'll be answering questions throughout the day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChiefRaconteur/status/1276594133130502149)\n\nEDIT - Thanks for the questions y’all, i’ll answer any remaining ones in the morning!",
