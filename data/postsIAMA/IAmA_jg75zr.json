        "selftext": "Hello, Reddit! We’re Ashish R. Panchal, M.D., Ph.D., Alexis Topjian, M.D., M.S.C.E., Khalid Aziz, M.B.B.S., M.A., M.Ed.(IT), Adam Cheng, M.D., and Katherine M. Berg, M.D. We’re medical experts who helped the American Heart Association to develop the newly published 2020 American Heart Association/Emergency Cardiovascular Care CPR guidelines.\n\nCardiac arrest – when the heart suddenly stops beating – results in death 97% of the time in the United States when it happens outside of the hospital setting (which is most of the time). Yesterday, the American Heart Association published its updated guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. The guidelines focus on the need to tackle health disparities and opioid-related incidents as well as early bystander and AED intervention, which remain key to the Chain of Survival. They also provide an extensive review of updates to evidence-based recommendations for CPR and emergency cardiovascular care training and response.\n\nKey updates to the guidelines include:\n\n•\tNew recommendations for recovery following CPR, which emphasize the physical, social and emotional needs of patients and their caregivers after survivors leave the hospital;\n\n•\tCPR training that now includes guidance on responding to victims of opioid overdose; and,\n\n•\tSuggestions for increasing lay rescuer CPR rates, noting that currently less than 40% of non-hospitalized adults experiencing cardiac arrest receive layperson-initiated CPR before the arrival of emergency medical services.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, the 2020 Guidelines outline 491 recommendations specific to adult, pediatric and neonatal life support, resuscitation education science and systems of care. In addition to the updated and new written guidance, algorithms to help triage care were updated to reflect the latest science, and several major changes were also made to improve the visual training and performance aids.\n\n**About the Experts:**\n\nAbout Dr. Adam Cheng: Dr. Cheng is a Calgary-based professor at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute of the University of Calgary. Dr. Cheng is the chair of the resuscitation education guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care\n\nAbout Dr. Alexis Topjian: Dr. Topjian is a Philadelphia-based pediatric critical care medicine physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Topjian also serves as an assistant professor in the department of anesthesia, critical care and Pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Dr. Topjian is the chair of the pediatrics guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.\n\nDr. Ashih Panchal: Dr. Panchal is an associate professor of emergency medicine for the department of emergency medicine at The Ohio State University. Dr. Panchal began his career as a researcher completing a Ph.D. in cardiovascular physiology at Case Western Reserve University. Following this, he completed his medical training and residency at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Dr. Panchal is a member of the American Heart Association’s Emergency Cardiovascular Care Scientific Subcommittee and is the chair of the adult guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.\n\nAbout Dr. Khalid Aziz: Dr. Aziz is a Canada-based professor at the University of Albert and works in the Department for Pediatrics. Dr. Aziz is the chair of the systems of care guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.\n\nAbout Dr. Katherine M. Berg: Dr. Berg is a pulmonary and critical care physician and assistant professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School. She is a graduate of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and completed her internal medicine residency at Tufts Medical Center. She completed her fellowship in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the Harvard Combined Program. Dr. Berg is the chair of the systems of care guidelines writing group for the 2020 AHA/ECC Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe’ll be sharing the key takeaways from the new guidelines and available to answer any questions you have related to CPR and Emergence Cardiovascular Care.
