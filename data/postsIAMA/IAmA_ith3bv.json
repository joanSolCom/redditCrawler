See, right before the pandemic hit, CollegeHumor was dumped by our corporate overlords at IAC, who laid off pretty much everyone but agreed to sell me the assets. At that point, I'd been running its video department for almost 15 years, so figured why not pour everything I had into this company as a last-ditch effort to save it?\n\n\nOver the past 6 months, me and an incredibly lean team have managed to keep CollegeHumor and DROPOUT running despite losing 95% of our employees (hire them, btw, they are the best - https://hireacollegehumorer.com/), COVID-19, a fascist president, California wildfires, and a bout of diverticulitis. But as my hero Samuel Beckett would say, there's nothing funnier than unhappiness!\n\n\nThe long and short of it is this: we're still making YouTube sketches (I've written a couple of animated \"If Google Was a Guy\" episodes focused on quarantine) and still shows for Dropout (a new season fo our D&amp;D acutalplay show Dimension 20 begins tomorrow; Um Actually and Erotic Clubhouse are consistently releasing new episodes; and we have a couple of other surprises in the works). A new season of my show Game Changer - a game show in which the game changes every episode - premieres this Friday on http://dropout.tv. For safety reasons, we're shooting all of our shows remotely, but I'm genuinely so excited about this season. It includes some of favorite episodes ever, and without giving too much away, some very special guests.\n\n\nAnd now I'm here to answer your questions, share some stories, and commiserate with you good people as our world hurdles towards an uncertain future.
