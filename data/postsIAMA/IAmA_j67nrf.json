They can answer any of your generic earthquake questions, but probably only specifics about the U.S. Pacific Northwest (not really about Oklahoma, Europe, etc.)  With the COVID-19 pandemic going on, there’s a chance you may be spending a lot of time in a different physical location than normal, such as more time at home.  Since an earthquake could strike at any time, “now” is the best time to learn about how to secure your space. We have  team of structural engineers and engineering researchers who can help answer your questions about making your space as earthquake-proof as possible. As we near the Great ShakeOut on October 15th, at 10:15, now is an excellent time to think about whether you’re prepared for your earthquake and tsunami hazards!  \n\nHere's [our proof via our verified Twitter account](https://twitter.com/waEMD/status/1311818289421590529). \n\nWe are just using one account and we're signing our first names.
