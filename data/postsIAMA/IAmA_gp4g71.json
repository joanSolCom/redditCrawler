In 2016 we developed and released NIVA which has been downloaded over 70k times ([https://followfeathers.itch.io/niva](https://followfeathers.itch.io/niva)).  In 2018 we founded our own indie studio and have since then been working on Weaving Tides which is a Zelda-inspired adventure game where you ride carpet dragons to patch up a magical, woven world! Weaving Tides has recently been successfully funded on Kickstarter ([http://kck.st/35j7zJh](http://kck.st/35j7zJh)) and is planned to release towards the end of this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can ask us all kinds of questions like:\n\n* How to found an indie game studio?\n* How to get funding for a game idea?\n* How we gathered interest for our games?\n* How we develop the textile world of Weaving Tides?\n\nSo let’s get this started! Ask us anything!\n\nBtw our answers, especially regarding funding and education, are based on our european experiences so please take them with a big grain of salt if you are from anywhere else around the world.\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/FollowFeathers/status/1264141844310642690](https://twitter.com/FollowFeathers/status/1264141844310642690)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE: end of AMA**Thanks for all of your questions!
