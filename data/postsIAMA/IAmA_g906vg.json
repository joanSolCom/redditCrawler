If you think you learned more than you needed to know about the Pilgrims and Plymouth Colony in elementary school, think again. This is a book that features the *Mayflower* passengers but also introduces a wide variety of Native communities and many different groups of English settlers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here's the overview:\n&gt; \n&gt; *In 1620, separatists from the Church of England set sail across the Atlantic aboard the Mayflower. Understanding themselves as spiritual pilgrims, they left to preserve their liberty to worship God in accordance with their understanding of the Bible.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *There exists, however, an alternative, more dispiriting version of their story. In it, the Pilgrims are religious zealots who persecuted dissenters and decimated Native peoples through warfare and by stealing their land. The Pilgrims’ definition of liberty was, in practice, very narrow.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *Drawing on original research using underutilized sources, John G. Turner moves beyond these familiar narratives in his sweeping and authoritative new history of Plymouth Colony. Instead of depicting the Pilgrims as otherworldly saints or extraordinary sinners, he tells how a variety of English settlers and Native peoples engaged in a contest for the meaning of American liberty.*\n&gt; \n&gt; I'll be here for the next few hours (from about 10:00 until about 1:00 Eastern) to talk all things Plymouth Colony, so please flood this thread with questions!",
