You can find a lot of information about the campaign at [www.mikeforaustin.com](https://www.mikeforaustin.com) and [www.instagram.com/mikeforaustin](https://www.instagram.com/mikeforaustin) but here are a few highlights:\n\n* I'm a former high school teacher, district administrator and state education leader with experience in designing, implementing, and managing systems in schools that focus on equity, accountability, and educator support.\n* I've supported systemic change management work in many districts across the country and across Texas.\n* Austin ISD is one of the most economically segregated school districts in the state. Addressing this issue can create more options and opportunities for ALL students while ensuring the equitable needs of the students we often leave behind are met.\n* Our campaign is focused on highlighting the needs of our education system to those who don't think \"they have a horse in the race\" because they don't have children in the schools. I believe that if you wait until you have kids to care about our schools, it will be too late for them. The quality of our education system affects all of society.\n\n***What are a few of the biggest challenges facing the district right now?***\n\n* Inequities based on race, income, and student ability: Engage in a comprehensive equity audit to address EVERY codified system/policy. Correct the foundation of AISD’s systems starting with addressing the enrollment and school-based funding systems.\n* Lack of trust from the community: Create an ombudsman office to manage and investigate complaints. Collaborate with the community and educators to co-create a structured school redesign process.\n* An increasing trend of families leaving AISD: Understand why students left and what we could have done to not lose them. Work to create the options within AISD that are reflective of those needs and wants.\n\n# I'm here to answer any questions you might have about Austin ISD or myself. I'm looking forward to your questions!\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/1y3D5vwU3uTNGbTy8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/1y3D5vwU3uTNGbTy8)",
