        "selftext": "**My short bio:** \n\nWe are cannabis lawyers at [Gleam Law](http://www.gleamlaw.com)! We have offices in the California, Washington, and Oregon markets and serve clients around the world. We practice business law, administrative law, intellectual property, and litigation with a focus on cannabis. \n\nWe help businesses form, comply, and thrive in the new cannabis industry. Our clients include farms, processors, retailers, dispensaries, and ancillary businesses such as publicly traded companies and international celebrities.\n\nIn the emerging cannabis system, regulatory bodies are struggling to grasp the complex subject matter. We help the government offices interpret the laws in regards to the practical application and use of medical and recreational marijuana.\n\nThis will be our fourth AMA! They’re always a great time for us.\n\nWe’re looking forward to round four. Joining us this time will be:\n\n**Neil Juneja:**\n\nNeil Juneja is the founder and managing partner of Gleam Law. He is a registered patent attorney and thinks the world of himself. He is also famous for his modesty.\n\n**Ammon Ford:** \n\nI am a JD/MBA business and trademark attorney at the Seattle branch of Gleam Law. I founded the Cannabis Law Society (CLAW) at Seattle University School of Law in 2014 and served as Secretary to the Washington State Bar Association's Cannabis Bar Section from 2018-2020. I am an active member of The Cannabis Alliance and the National Cannabis Industry Association. \n\n**Brian Barrido:**\n\nI am an attorney at Gleam Law's Washington office focusing on civil litigation matters in the cannabis industry.  I also have extensive experience in criminal litigation in state and federal court.  \n\n**Justin Walsh:**\n\nI am partner in our Seattle office. I lead the litigation department; advise businesses on Cannabis, hemp, and CBD regulations; and make a great cocktail.\n\n**Mia Getlin:**\n\nMia is a partner at Gleam Law, leading the firm's Oregon practice and advising clients on a wide range of issues, including compliance, licensing, and transactions. As part of an industry advocacy organization she co-runs, Mia works closely with the legislature, the OLCC, and other offices and agencies in Oregon to effect changes to law and rule to benefit Oregon cannabis companies. When Mia is not at the office, she can be found wrangling her three small children or doing something dangerous in Oregon's great outdoors.\n\n**Habib Bentaleb:**\n\nI am a California-based cannabis attorney focusing on the business side of cannabis law. I commonly speak at industry events and help keep the legal community appraised on the latest issues in cannabis.\n\n**Lindsey Daniel:**\n\nI am an attorney at Gleam Law’s Oregon office focusing on the business and regulatory legal needs of our cannabis clients. When I’m not doing lawyer-y things (excuse the technical term) I enjoy hiking, re-watching old episodes of the X-Files and 30 Rock, and battling my two cats for preeminence in my apartment.\n\n**Roger Goodman:**\n\nRoger Goodman is associated Of Counsel to the firm and specializes in regulatory compliance and government relations for cannabis businesses. He is also in his seventh term serving in the Washington State Legislature, presiding as Chair of the House Public Safety Committee with oversight of the criminal justice system. As a drug policy reformer for more than a decade, Roger was a key player in laying the groundwork for cannabis legalization in Washington State.\n\n**Cassidy Patnoe:**\n\nI’m a third-year law student. I’m a former high-school teacher and current law-clerk at Gleam.\n\n\n**Our Proof:** [Proof Here!](https://www.gleamlaw.com/dont-miss-our-4-20-reddit-ama/)\n\nEDIT: We are not providing legal advice. As always, verify any of our answers with an attorney that is representing you.\n\n\n\nEDIT #2:Thanks everyone! We had a blast on this great holiday! We'll check periodically and keep answering questions, but we're going to take lunch and get back to work.",
