Today we're going to be doing something pretty neat in that we're connecting with people all over the globe to record them throwing an axe! We're hopefully going to set a world record for most people throwing an axe simultaneously.\n\nFor those who don't know me, I have been the Commissioner for the World Axe Throwing League since its early days of 2017. Part of my role in doing so was developing the rules for the sport, working/consulting with amazing small businesses and players, and helping grow the sport from 12 or so locations to over 300 in 20 countries around the world. We've been fortunate with a great amount of growth and being featured on ESPN internationally also where you may have seen or heard me commentating. \n\nJust recently announced, while I'll still be working closely with the World Axe Throwing League, I'm transitioning to the Head of Development with our new sports venture, the World Knife Throwing League!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm here to answer any questions you have about axes, knives, sports, or anything else that fits your fancy. \n\nAlso, I currently have 15 axes tattooed from books, movies, shows, folklore and other things I'm a fan of. If you have any suggestions for cool axes I can get next please let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/WATLaxe)",
