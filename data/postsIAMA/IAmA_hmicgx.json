One, I don't want to milk this for karma, and frankly, I'd feel bad if I got karma on my main acc for something like this. And second, if people accuse me of faking this, I don't want my main account downvote bombed.\n\nThis gets a little long, tldr at the end. \n\nWith that out the way, I don't really know a great way of showing proof. I don't feel particularly comfortable showing my doctor's papers, and even if I wanted to, I'm not near those atm. However, I do have a part of my skull missing (more on that later), as well as a scar on the back of my head, and I tried my best to show that, though it's hard as I have long hair.\n\nSo, backstory, about a year ago (actually probably a bit more than a year), I had slight headaches and felt like I had a slight bulge on the back of my head. My mom didn't really believe me at first and thought I just had headaches from being on my computer too much lol. Eventually though, we saw our doctor, and after a few visits to different doctors, I was diagnosed with langerhans cell histiocytosis. Which is essentially, well, a tumor chewing away at my skull (or that's how I understood it at least).\n\nLuckily we went to the doctor early enough that it didn't actually get to my brain yet, and soon, I had to have a surgery, which was to literally remove a small part of my skull on the back of the head, the part of it that had the tumor on it. I'm pretty sure they scraped it away? I'm honestly not sure, I never really questioned what the surgery actually was, I guess because the whole situation was so surreal to me.\n\nThat was pretty much my only major hospital experience ever so far. I never had a broken bone or anything. And man, hospitals suck.\n\nAnyway, I luckily didn't undergo chemotherapy, which I mean, phew. There's still a possibility the tumor gets worse again, but the chances aren't too big. Though I don't wanna assume anything. Right now as I understand it, there's still bits of the tumor left, but they're not growing or doing anything, and it's essentially possible for me to just live my whole life with them just sitting there.\n\nOfc my whole understanding of everything isn't great, so I could have probably got a lot of stuff wrong. Anyways, AMA.\n\nTLDR: i was diagnosed with langerhans cell histiocytosis, had the part of my skull with the tumor removed, i luckily didn't undergo chemotherapy, there's a small chance the tumor grows again but it's minimal.\n\nThe most proof i could think of, my face with me holding a paper with my reddit username, and me trying my best to show the back of my head.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/WPYrj7l",
