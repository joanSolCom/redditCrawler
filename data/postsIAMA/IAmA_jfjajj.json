Not a former CEO of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce that led an attempt to buy seats on the Seattle City Council in 2019 on behalf of corporations' interests to not pay their fair share. We've seen enough of that in this pandemic where U.S. billionaires' wealth grew immensely at the expense of struggling Americans. I want to change the rhetoric that Congress can be directed by corporate dollars.\n\nWhile my opponent accepts thousands from corporate PACs I have gained the support of over 15,500 individual donors with an average contribution of $57.45. This is a people-powered campaign and I wholeheartedly believe I will serve the people's interests better than my opponent.
