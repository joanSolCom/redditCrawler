Even before COVID-19, we had more people on food stamps than we did in 2008. Ballooning income inequality has fractured our country and the people currently in charge have shown they are not equipped to meet the moment. NY-6 deserves a representative that will fight tooth and nail for equity and justice, not someone beholden to corporate interests and the real estate industry.**\n\nI’m Melquiades Gagarin and [I’m running for NY-6th’s Congressional seat](https://youtu.be/3v5bX3u0XFU), the only district entirely in Queens, NY.\n\nMy starting position on every policy position is eliminating and reducing harm. That’s why I’m running [on a platform](https://melforprogress.com/issues) that includes:\n\n* Medicare For All \n* A Homes Guarantee \n* Cancelling Student Debt \n* A Green New Deal \n* Radical Reproductive Justice Policy \n* Marajuana Legalization \n* Golden Years Security Act \n* Repealing SESTA-FOSTA\n\n[...and more.](https://melforprogress.com/issues)\n\nMy background is in policy advocacy. My entire career has been dedicated to advancing the causes of social justice and addressing inequity, particularly those faced by marginalized communities. I led the policy department at College and Community Fellowship working to eliminate barriers to higher education for currently and formerly incarcerated individuals. There, I worked alongside impacted individuals, activists and other stakeholders to eliminate the box on SUNY admissions forms, get the Obama DOE to roll out the [Pell Pilot Program](https://icpa.org/u-s-department-of-education-launches-second-chance-pell-pilot-program-for-incarcerated-individuals/#:~:text=Through%20this%20pilot%20program%2C%20incarcerated,pursue%20postsecondary%20education%20and%20training.) for incarcerated students, and see the issuance of national guidance to eliminate the box from the college admissions process. We also saw the introduction of the [REAL Act](https://www.fcnl.org/updates/bill-analysis-the-restoring-education-and-learning-real-act-2050) in both houses of Congress that would undo the harm of the 1994 Crime Bill which restricted incarcerated students from Pell Grants. Additionally, I have worked as a Congressional aide representing parts of this district and have helped advance gender, racial, and economic justice at organizations such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Planned Parenthood of New York City.\n\nMy opponent [Grace Meng is a 4-term incumbent who has taken over $340,000 in donations from Real Estate &amp; developers](https://melforprogress.com/sources/) in a district that is seeing massive displacement. Among her other donors are Goldman Sachs, AT&amp;T, Boeing and Raytheon. She’s consistently voted to expand Trump’s military budget, expand surveillance, weaken the ACA, and voted against impeachment three times, only flipping her vote after I entered the race.\n\nMost recently we’ve seen her begin faux-gressive posturing around Criminal Justice reform, despite the fact she voted for bills such as the Thin Blue Line Act and the Protect &amp; Serve Act, which are Republican pieces of legislation that served to distract from the Black Lives Matter movement as well as expanding the death penalty. She has also taken a secret endorsement from the Police Benevolent Association, the same group responsible for the [“I Can Breathe” shirts](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/20/i-can-breathe-thanks-to-the-nypd-shirts-flood-pro-/) after the murder of Eric Garner in 2014.\n\n**Queens deserves better than Grace Meng. I will not be a career politician and  have no ambitions to join the ranks of Democratic leadership. My job will be to fight tooth and nail for my constituents and to stop the creep of fascist authoritarianism that Democrats have coddled for far too long.**\n\nWe need help getting the word out to voters, please join us for a volunteer shift.\n\n[My Website](https://melforprogress.com/) | [Donate to my Campaign](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/melforprogress) | [Follow me on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/melforprogress/) | [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/melforprogress) | [Follow me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mel.gagarin/)| [Subscribe to my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKHWgYhoaS9u-Jal8s_4wUQ) |\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/OurPoliticalRev/status/1271837174451695619)",
