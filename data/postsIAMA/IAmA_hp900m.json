I was one of the co-creators of #CharlestonSyllabus, the crowd-sourced resource developed to help Americans understand the context behind the 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME. We produced Charleston Syllabus, a book of readings on race, racism, and racial violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may have seen me on Henry Louis Gates's PBS documentary, Reconstruction: America after the Civil War or heard me on Slate Academy: Reconstruction, BackStory, specifically Respectfully Yours, Gainer Atkins and The Difference Ten Miles Makes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most U.S. historians researching racist violence and racial terror have focused on perpetrators, bystanders, the state, and media responses to it. Having learned about lynching as an undergrad through the killing of Mary Turner, a heavily pregnant Black woman who was lynched as part of a 1918 lynching spree in Lowndes County, Georgia, I wondered, \"how did her people live with and through her killing, that of her fetus, and her husband?\" At the time, lynching historians' rarely attempted to answer that kind of question. Literary and popular culture scholars who explored African Americans' responses often prioritized public thinkers and writers, most of whom knew about this violence, which is reflected in their literature, but weren't often at the epicenter of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The inability of existing research to answer my questions drove my own research in graduate school and became the basis for Great Marks. I used African Americans' testimonies about a wide range of racist violence (night riding, lynching, Klan raids, massacres, and rape) from emancipation to the World War I to shift our gaze to targeted people. Doing that enabled me to unearth both a wider range of harm and different modes of resistance. I am especially interested in the immediate and long-term physical, psychic, and psychological injuries from this violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although I focus primarily on African American victims, I do recognize the need to acknowledge and histories of racist violence directed at Native Americans as well as Americans of Mexican and Chinese descent and origin in the late nineteenth and early 20th century.",
