I was threatened with legal charges, received death threats, someone online even called me fat :'( \n\nAt the time, they told us we were fighting for freedom but I thought that was a bald-faced lie. More than fifteen years later and law enforcement all over the country has proved it was. They told us that it was better to fight the terrorists \"over there rather than over here\" and now look where we are.\n\nIn 2006, I couldn't convince other soldiers that the rights I was flexing were their rights too.\n\nThis past week, an Army regional commander--a 4-star general--sent an email to everyone under his command an affirmation that soldiers do have the right to \"participate in off-post demonstrations in the United States when they are off-duty, out of uniform, when their activities do not constitute a breach of law and order and when violence is not likely to result.\"\n\nThe general went on to specify \"My general order prohibits social and recreational gatherings.  I do not view those who want to exercise their first amendment rights as engaged in a social or recreational gathering. \"\n\nThis. Is. Huge. The general is tacitly giving all soldiers under his command permission to take to the streets in order to speak directly to their civilian leadership!\n\nThe general is obviously correct but his email didn't go far enough. In addition to having the right to participate in off-post demonstrations, active-duty servicemembers have the right to speak to media and voice their dissent provided they don't use slanderous language against anyone high up in their chain-of-command (anyone with stars on their uniform or \"secretary\" in their title and definitely not the Commander-in-Chief).\n\nI will caveat this to mention that the Army picks and chooses the charges it brings forward. I did a radio interview with an active-duty soldier who absolutely called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney \"liars\" and I'm friends with an active-duty NCO who publicly spoke out against the war IN UNIFORM. Neither were punished.\n\nIn the interview I talk about in the below clip, I was not off-duty, nor out-of-uniform, nor off-post, and I wasn't punished. \n\nAll of us were honorably discharged.\n\nThese are the times when heroes identify themselves and right now the country could use a hero if not a thousand.\n\nAsk me anything! :)\n\nThe following list is not exhaustive. I talked to any journalist who would listen; LA Times, Houston Chronicle, BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). Those were probably some of the biggest outlets plus a myriad of smaller ones.\n\n[60 Minutes - GIs Petition Congress to End Iraq War](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gis-petition-congress-to-end-iraq-war/) \\- The one that got me and IMDB credit and body shamed.
