Once they took me out of handcuffs I received a letter from Amazon that was sitting on my front porch.

In the report I asked if Amazon would like to conduct an exit interview with me. On 7/14/2020 I sent an email to jeff@amazon.com in regards to an exit interview. Amazon never offered me an exit interview, as far as I recall.",
