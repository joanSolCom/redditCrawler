Please don't come expecting to ask current events questions, as questions focused on that will be removed as per the rules of the subreddit.\n\n&gt;  Hi everyone! I’m Dr. William Quinn, an economic and financial historian with a particular focus on financial bubbles and crises. My new book with Prof. John D. Turner, Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles, is out on Thursday with Cambridge University Press.\n&gt; \n&gt; Financial bubbles are large increases in the price of an asset (usually houses, stocks, or both) followed by a large fall in their price, typically with no obvious cause. Often, this is accompanied by a boom in supply i.e. building of new houses or issuing of new stocks. Some bubbles are fairly benign for the economy, but others precede very severe depressions, leading to mass unemployment, poverty, and other social and economic problems. \n&gt; \n&gt; Our book covers 10 bubbles from throughout history, starting with the first recorded major bubbles of 1720 (the tulips don’t count!). As well as the famous ones -1920s stocks, 2000s houses - we cover some more obscure bubbles, such as the Latin American financial asset boom of 1825, the Australian land boom of the 1880s-90s, and the British bicycle mania of the 1890s. I specialise in bubbles and crises, but feel free to AMA about financial or economic history generally and I’ll do my best to answer!",
