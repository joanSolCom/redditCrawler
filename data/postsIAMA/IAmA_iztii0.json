We've worked hard on this app project for almost 2 years now to make sure the audio, image quality, and user experience are top notch. This app is mainly for English speakers wanting to learn French, but we plan to expand to more languages in the future. If interested in learning French, we'd love to hear from your experience using BaOui - whether you enjoyed it or if there is any room for improvement. Any constructive feedback is welcome and very helpful for us, especially since we just launched it and the first four lessons are free! We're a team of only 3 - me and my brother (both born and raised in Paris) and my American wife who edited the whole app (especially the grammar part) to make it as understandable as possible for English speakers. We hired a freelance developer as well on November 5th, 2019, and she did a fantastic job turning our vision to reality! For BaOui, we aimed to create the most comprehensive, easy-to-learn French language learning app with a modern yet very user-friendly design, and we wanted to structure the lessons in a way that would be clear, practical, fun, and customizable for users.\n\nWe hope you’ll like it! If you have any questions about the process feel free to ask.\n\nBAOUI TEAM\n\nAsk away!\n\n[https://twitter.com/baouiapp/status/1309619546249146369](https://twitter.com/baouiapp/status/1309619546249146369)\n\nDownload it here: [https://www.baouiapp.com](https://www.baouiapp.com/)",
