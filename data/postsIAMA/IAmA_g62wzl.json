In the difficult days we are experiencing due to Covid-19, I am hoping that collectively we are beginning to see how the world is connected globally, how what one country or individual does can affect all others, and how we are collectively finding ways to work together to build hope for building a healthier world. I know that in each person’s heart there is a desire to do good and care for all that is loved. In the light of that, I hope we can come together to care about and show our hope and love for humanity, children, and the natural world. I want to act with love and caring to support and nurture life. Thus, I have devoted myself to try to find positive lifecycle solutions to plastic waste, for what we do with plastic, good or evil, can last forever.\n\n[I just completed folding and stringing 1000 peace cranes out of clean non-recyclable plastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KreM0n5qlLI)\n\nMy wish is for a positive lifecycle for plastic.  Why a “positive lifecycle?”  Plastic is forever. A positive lifecycle for plastic is when mixed-waste plastic is given a beneficial end-use. Instead of having a negative effect on life, plastic could potentially have a positive effect on humanity and when the environment is cleaned and protected from plastics - support life.  Imagine the benefits to the natural world and the benefits to humanity if all plastic had a positive end-use in, for example, architectural constructions we *want* to last forever. I believe, if we come together collectively, we could, eventually, end child homelessness.  \n\nSince 2010, I have saved my family’s non-recyclable plastic.   Seeing how plastic waste was polluting the water and killing life, and inspired by the work of the Pura-Vida Organization in Atitlan, Guatemala, I decided to try to change the way I responded to my plastic waste.  Without a designed solution in mind, I began carefully collecting, cleaning, drying and storing the non-recyclable plastic from my family of four. Two years later, plastic packaging was stored under every bed in every possible cabinet.  My daughter was born in early 2012, and with the demands of a newborn, I found I had to make this process of bottlingup plastic easier.  Using bottles with a larger opening made all the difference.  After searching and finding inspiration in the Pinwheel House of Ying chee Chui, I began to develop the Pinwheel House idea to include plastic waste as a wall component, thus forming an extensible system of architecture for communities to begin to use non-recyclable plastic as a resource.  In 2016, I prototyped the first form of this system, a bus stop.  \n\n[PROOF](https://www.shannonleegilmour.com)\n\nI continue to save all my non-recyclable plastics every day. \n\nI know developing a positive lifecycle for mixed plastic waste is possible… and becoming more and more essential – as the throw-away default for plastic is damaging to health and wellbeing of all life ….forever.  \n\nIf we don’t clean up our mess and our actions – who will?\n\nDo you share my wish?   My hope is to bring like-minded people together, so we can begin to create a more beautiful and healthy world together. \n\nBegin today - Earth Day, the 50th anniversary, to transform waste plastic into beauty and hope by folding a plastic peace crane with me. Post your creation on Instagram, Twitter, etc. With the hashtags #PEACEWITHPLASTIC, #PositiveLifecycle4Plastic \n\nIf you resonate with this mission and vision – please come and be a part of it. \n\nTogether, we can be the change we wish to see. \n\nwww.peacewithplastic.org",
