The first round of our survey, the International Cannabis Cultivation Questionnaire v1, was conducted in 2012 and helped break apart a lot of the stereotypes about cannabis growers. Now we've launched the second round of the [survey](www.worldwideweed.nl), the ICCQ 2, and we're keen gather as many responses as possible from around the world to ensure that cannabis growers are understood as real people, not caricatures.\n\nWe're here today to answer your questions about cannabis and cannabis growing, and drug policy. While cannabis growing is the focus of this project, our team has expertise across many areas of drugs policy as well, so feel free to really Ask Us Anything about drugs and we'll do our best to get the right person on your post. Unfortunately we're social scientists, not botanists or chemists, so we're more likely to talk about deterrence theory and policy making than give you advice on the best nutrient recipe for a 4x4 tent grow using coco coir and CMH bulbs.  That said, we'd like to hear yours...\n\nThe GCCRC has team members from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Israel, Italy, New Zealand (so close guys!), Portugal, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay. Don't worry, even if your country isn't represented you can still [take the survey!](https://worldwideweed.nl/)\n\nWe would really appreciate your participation in our survey. We take your [privacy very seriously](https://worldwideweed.nl/security-and-anonymity/) and don't use any cookies or IP tracking. We also don't take money from cannabis producers or retailers, and our data is not intended for commercial use. We're a bunch of academics who care about good cannabis policy and are interested in exploring an area of drugs policy often overlooked by prohibitionist regimes that are focused on measuring arrests and not on why a person who grows cannabis does so. Our survey covers a lot of ground, including views on regulations about growing cannabis, how you grow your cannabis, and what you do with it once you've processed it.\n\nWe're launching this AMA at 9am US Eastern time (New York) and will have members of the team swinging through to answer questions throughout the day. We'll try to remember to sign our names and country with each response.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to talk with you today!\n\nEdit 20:30 US ET: Thanks all. It's been a great 12 hours and we really appreciate all your questions. Please take some time to share you insights with us by taking the survey at www.worldwideweed.nl. You can also contact us via that website if you have any questions. Cheers All!",
