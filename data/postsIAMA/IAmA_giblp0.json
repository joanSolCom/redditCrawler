My long-term goal is to help solve the major challenges transitioning to 100% renewable energy. As I sought a career path, it seemed the best position was within the electric utility since 100% renewable energy will require transforming the physical infrastructure and operational power flow of the electric grid.\n\nDesign Engineer was my first position in the industry where I was responsible for developing construction packages for new substation equipment. With a recent promotion to Associate Protection Engineer, my new job responsibilities are to calculate relay settings for transmission protection systems. System Protection is considered the most technically challenging and prestigious group within the company. System Protection is an integral part of keeping the complex transmission grid together, and the experience I will gain is absolutely critical to achieving my long-term goal.\n\nMy colleagues say renewable energy is a challenge in protection systems. Solving these problems may require a paradigm shift in many areas including protection systems. My goal is to lead the effort to find solutions and advocate for sustainable energy.
