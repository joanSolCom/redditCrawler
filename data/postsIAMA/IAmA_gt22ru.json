We have over 200 engineers, designers, business professionals and more working together to be the first college students to launch a liquid bi-propellant rocket into space by 2021.\n\nOur Director of Test Operations, Collin, is hosting an **AMA/takeover of our Instagram account (@TexasRocketLab) TODAY with a special live session from 5-5:30pm** CST. If you have any interest in rocketry, the New Space Industry, or how to get more involved in STEM, he’s got the knowledge! We’ll be reposting some of the questions and his responses below. Comment what you wanna know about rocketry and catch the Instagram Live to see your question answered! We’ll post the full video here later, just in case you miss it.\n\nCollin is an incoming senior studying mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. Collin is the new Director of Test Operations for the Texas Rocket Engineering Lab, where he manages personnel and operations within the Test and Launch Operations (TLO) team. He joined TREL in the Fall of 2019 as a Weather Balloon General Engineer, then became the Weather Balloon Co-lead in January 2020. Last month, he became a director for TLO, and is now working to hot fire the TREL rocket engine, test weather balloons, and burst a carbon fiber overwrapped pressure vessel over the summer. In addition to TREL, Collin is working on a waste management and sustainability project for Rome, enjoys social and urban dance, and often hikes through the Barton Greenbelt in Austin.\n\nAsk Collin Anything!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVerification: [https://twitter.com/texasrocketlab/status/1266484893648932867?s=20](https://twitter.com/texasrocketlab/status/1266484893648932867?s=20)",
