Then COVID came, and [Gov. Kemp did a terrible job dealing with it](https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/breaking-georgia-governor-orders-shelter-place-curb-coronavirus/vdAoWkjq39W2usr9e8W8BL/), because he is obsessed with signaling his “conservativeness” to President Trump, the national Republican Party, and national special interest groups.  That definitely shifted some thought, because many Georgians like to be healthy and for their friends and loved ones to also be healthy.\n\nThen [Ahmaud Arbrey was killed by racists](https://www.ajc.com/local/brunswick-shooting-summons-old-scars-fresh-suspicions/1Ny2T7S26EWmJwUtRBdnCJ/) with no immediate consequence from the law enforcement.  [Rayshard Brooks was killed by law enforcement officers](https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/man-shot-killed-atlanta-police-wendy-drive-thru/rUUFN6yfvgsevgIc2Q7ZkJ/) at the conclusion of an interaction that began with him being asleep in his car.  In the context of the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and so many others, this brought the failings of our Republican-led state government into harsh relief, which has also shifted the political landscape in Georgia.\n\nNow we have [COVID-19 predictably surging in Georgia](https://www.ajc.com/news/deadly-toll-georgia-surpasses-000-coronavirus-deaths/TUOotCdeBweO4Y2grXkR0H/).  It’s becoming hard to ignore.  [Kemp’s order to re-open the state](https://www.ajc.com/news/lifting-stay-home-order-kemp-shifts-focus-economic-recovery/XpDEUrQcQPQ5ejjMJUIqmO/) specifically prohibited local governments from making regulations that deviated from his order (stronger or weaker) - so much for “local control.”  Now, [cities across Georgia are testing the validity of this order by putting mask orders in place](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/growing-number-georgia-cities-require-masks-over-kemp-objection/rLK5RODzq1EVJiyebeIi2H/).  In the context of more infections, more hospitalizations, and sadly, more deaths, the people of Georgia have an opportunity to understand how the Republican Party of Georgia doesn’t care about them.\n\nI’m running to represent the people of House District 21 in the Georgia General Assembly because they have not been represented for so long, and all Georgians - like all Americans - deserve to be in control of their elected officials and their governments.  I believe that this is a unique time, which provides my neighbors with a unique opportunity to see how good a government run by Democrats can serve them.\n\nI’m excited for this opportunity to answer your questions, reddit!\n\n* [proof](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCoNMWbDnQ5/)  (also my Instagram)\n* [Hughes for Georgia](https://hughesforgeorgia.com/)  \n* [Hughes4GA Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hughes4GA)  \n* [Hughes4GA Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hughes4GA)  \n* [Hughes for Georgia YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGDus10k3ldo23KwqgVAjEg)  \n* [Hughes for Georgia ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/hughes-for-georgia#)\n_______________________________________________\n\n[AMA at this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/hr46x6/i_am_william_hughes_candidate_for_georgia_house/)",
