We play gongs, crystal singing bows, vibraphones , etc to put you in a trance-like state. Many people report feeling the calmest they've ever felt.\n\nI've been a really heady, anxious person my whole life, and this stuff opened up my world. I met my co-founder, Guy Douglas, in 2012, and he introduced me to these instruments. We've been on a journey to share how much this can help people deepen their meditation practice ever since.\n\n&gt;\\*\\*Since 2017, we've regularly gathered 1300 people to meditate together on Monday nights in San Francisco!\\*\\*We co-created \"The Sound Healing Symphony\" and gathered a community of incredible musicians to share the sound in traditionally 'sacred' spaces like cathedrals, temples etc.We've sold out shows all over the country and been on NBC Today. Our shows are best known for the quality of the sound.\n\nProof: [here's me now.](https://imgur.com/gallery/BJvpGLn) And [here's me on NBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zg4vHbhtTM).\n\nDuring the pandemic, we transitioned, quickly. We needed to find a way to keep sharing this practice, especially during a time when our community was experiencing uncertainty and isolation. **We invested all we had left in high quality audio production + livestreaming gear, and** [**we built a platform**](https://www.soundmeditationpresents.com/)**.** It was a wild ride with a lot of trial and error, but we got the sound dialed in. It sounds like we're doing a private sound bath in your home, and you can experience it at any time. Plus the livestreams enable us to still gather in a way. Our community is now subscribed at $16 a month and experiencing the sound baths in bed instead of having to go to an event ;)\n\nHow you can check us out— (we offer a free trial if you're curious!)— [www.soundmeditationpresents.com](https://www.soundmeditationpresents.com/).",
