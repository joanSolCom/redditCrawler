As said in the title, the fires are only ten minutes away from my house and we have received an evacuation warning. From what I have been told in online school, if our area is to be evacuated, people will come knocking at our door and we will have an hour to leave. Yesterday, the sky looked like nuketown from bo2 zombies and had an air rating of 194 (unhealthy) to above 200 (very unhealthy). Today is a lot better, with the air quality being 157 (unhealthy), which still sounds bad but the air is actually somewhat breathable and there is only a slight smoke smell. You guys are free to ask me anything, and I am excited to see what the responses will be!\n\nProof: [Here](https://earth.google.com/web/@37.3379604,-121.78241407,94.82350922a,0d,60y,148.41239225h,82.29573814t,0r/data=IhoKFmJwVDF4bVBmUXJvM3V0MHhSc3Yxb1EQAg) is a photo of my neighbor's house from google earth and [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/zlMZOCw) is that same house with my u/ on a piece of paper (yes that is smoke in the background).\n\nEdit: [Here](https://csj.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InformationLookup/index.html?appid=63226957c1744bb2bb5111750965fa17) is the website that shows what areas are being evacuated.
