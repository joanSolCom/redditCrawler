My name is [Ed Roberts](https://www.kent.ac.uk/history/people/1476/roberts-edward) and I'm a lecturer in early medieval history in the [School of History](https://www.kent.ac.uk/history) and [Centre for Medieval and Early Modern Studies](https://www.kent.ac.uk/medieval-early-modern-studies) at the University of Kent (Canterbury, UK). My research focuses on later Carolingian and Ottonian Europe, and I'm the author of [*Flodoard of Rheims and the Writing of History in the Tenth Century*](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/european-history-450-1000/flodoard-rheims-and-writing-history-tenth-century?format=HB)*.* \n&gt; \n&gt; This is a book about historiography, in every sense of the word - how history was perceived and written in the tenth century, and how subsequent historians have approached and understood that period in the light of its surviving narrative sources. Flodoard, one of the period's rare chroniclers, has traditionally been read as a passive observer of a \"darkening\" tenth century in which political authority disintegrated and religious standards collapsed. I argue that we have been too ready to take Flodoard at his word. He was in fact a very discerning author who crafted quite deliberate narratives of his time. Bad things happened to him and his community of clerics in Rheims; he was pessimistic about his own day and nostalgic for an imagined idyllic past. In offering a corrective to misapprehensions of Flodoard and his works, I suggest that the West Frankish (French) political community of the earlier tenth century was not the morass of violent conflict it has long been portrayed as, and that the period was far more culturally innovative than has tended to be recognised. You can read a bit more about why I wrote the book [here](http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2019/09/individuality-and-history-in-the-age-of-iron-flodoard-of-rheims/).\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm happy to chat about anything related to the history of Western Europe in the tenth century, or indeed the early Middle Ages up to c.1100. I've also researched and published on early medieval legal practice, including legal documents (charters), literacy and languages (i.e. Latin and the vernaculars), and canon law (esp. the Pseudo-Isidorian forgeries). My current research looks at bishops from c.900-c.1100, asking how redefinitions of what it meant to be a bishop contributed to the triumph of the \"reform papacy\" and the \"Gregorian revolution\" in the late eleventh century.\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm also interested in digital humanities and public history. I helped build [Charlemagne's Europe](http://charlemagneseurope.ac.uk/), a database of charters from the reign of Charlemagne (768-814), and lately I've begun incorporating Wikipedia editing into my teaching and asking my students to think about the powerful role it now plays in the dissemination of historical knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can also find me on Twitter [@e\\_c\\_roberts](https://twitter.com/e_c_roberts). I'll be here from 3pm BST (10am EDT) until at least 7pm, and I'll do my best to answer your questions!",
