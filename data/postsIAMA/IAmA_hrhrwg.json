Blizzard is the best and I will fight you over it! ðŸ˜¤ \n\nBack during March we got hit with the extremely sudden news that our CPs would be leaving us. The entire day was the absolute worst. Everyone was constantly crying and panicking, many CMs were ICPs and were worried they'd have no where to go after they were more or less evicted, especially because at the time we were under travel bans/restrictions.\n\nIt was an incredibly hard blow to us as workers and took us all by surprise. I guess it didn't really occur to me how serious COVID was until that happened. \n\nShortly thereafter we all were furloughed for months. Unemployment was incredible and also the worst experience ever. Some of us, like me, were fortunate in that everything worked out and we got our money no problem. The other half of cast members are still unable to buy groceries and haven't seen any money whatsoever. \n\nI was recalled back a few weeks ago and last week was my introduction back into the company.
