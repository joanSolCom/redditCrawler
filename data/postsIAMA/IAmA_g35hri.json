(We also have a highly listenable [podcast](https://patreon.com/currentaffairs).) Here is a [profile](https://www.thedailybeast.com/not-all-bernie-bros-are-angry-young-men-meet-nathan-j-robinson) of our work by the *Daily Beast. Politico* has called us \"[niche but influential](https://twitter.com/curaffairs/status/1212406392658812929)\" and Matthew Yglesias of *Vox* [says](https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1247930492286111746) we are the reason for Joe Biden's unity problem. *The Ringer* [classifies](https://www.theringer.com/2017/3/23/16044958/new-left-media-current-affairs-chapo-trap-house-crooked-media-9cb016070532) us alongside Chapo Trap House and *Jacobin* as part of the new wave of leftist media, but we make way less money than they do. ([Subscribe!](http://currentaffairs.org/subscribe)) \n\nWe put out a gorgeous print edition that I am very proud of (check out my [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkS1nHeZuks)). It looks really good on coffee tables. I do most of the layout design work myself. It features lots of comics, puzzles, and games. I wanted to replicate the feeling of *Mad* or *Nickelodeon* magazines but with left politics. We've collected a bunch of these in the [*Current Affairs Big Book of Amusements*](https://www.amazon.com/Current-Affairs-Big-Book-Amusements/dp/0997844736)*.* When we started the magazine, Graydon Carter of *Vanity Fair* told me I would fail. Four years later, we are thriving even as a print magazine in a digital era. Take that, Graydon Carter! \n\nLast year I published a book called [***Why You Should Be A Socialist***](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250200877)**,** which is intended to convince people skeptical of socialism that we're not a bunch of authoritarian economic illiterates. I also wrote five [fictitious reviews](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/12/five-self-written-reviews-of-why-you-should-be-a-socialist) of it including one supposedly written by a manatee. (I once hosted the short-lived [Manatee Facts Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKHe_zNxOzM).) Here's a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZuc7KnmazQ&amp;t=2m0s) I did about the book with Timothy Faust. Here's a [debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UiGCjgY2v4) I had with a libertarian about socialism. \n\nMy next project is starting a left enemy to MSNBC, but I am not yet sure we can raise the amount of money necessary. If we could, it would be excellent. \n\nOther facts about me: I am technically a lawyer but my law license has been suspended. I do not have a fake accent, though there has been a lot of misinformation about this. Noam Chomsky has told me that he emails people my [article](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve) about Jordan Peterson if they ask him to talk about Jordan Peterson, because Chomsky doesn't want to have to bother thinking about him. I do not wear bowties, even though I totally seem like the kind of person who would wear bowties. In 2016 I [said](https://static.currentaffairs.org/2016/02/unless-the-democrats-nominate-sanders-a-trump-nomination-means-a-trump-presidency) that if Bernie Sanders wasn't nominated, Donald Trump would be president. People thought I was an idiot, but I wasn't.\n\nThings I might be able to to talk about: how to build a media organization that survives in difficult times. How to fake your way though an Ivy League law school. How to convince people you are credible even when you are not. How to write about politics without boring the pants off of your audience. How to overthrow capitalism (still working on this). How to write children's books. How to dress garishly. How to free yourself of libertarian brain poison. How to purchase an annual subscription to our magazine for a very reasonable rate. \n\nI am here to answer all questions! (Proof that I am who I say I am [here](https://twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1250152472070500353?s=20)!)\n\n**UPDATE:** Thank you for all the questions! I will try to answer as many more as I can before I wrap up soon.
