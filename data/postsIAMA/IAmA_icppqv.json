Cerus was founded almost three decades ago and is the only company that has an FDA approved system to inactivate pathogens in both platelets and plasma, called the INTERCEPT Blood System. Pathogen reduction is recognized as an effective measure to reduce transfusion-transmitted infectious (TTI) risk from pathogens including HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and many other pathogens.  We partner with national blood services, blood centers, and hospitals to implement our technology into blood component production operations, which ultimately benefits patients who rely on safe blood.  INTERCEPT treated blood components are used in transfusions for cancer patients, surgeries, and medical emergencies, as well as for experimental convalescent plasma transfusions to treat COVID-19 patients.  Our INTERCEPT technology is already used in more than 30 countries across the globe.  To get a sense of our potential reach, in the U.S. alone, up to 70% of the population will receive a blood transfusion at some time in their lives.\n\nAfter I got my B.A.S. in Economics and Biological Sciences from Stanford University, I began my career in healthcare and biotech at Baxter International working in its Biotech group that focused on plasma derivative therapeutics.  During my time at Baxter, I witnessed the impact of HIV and Hepatitis B and C on the blood supply and joined Cerus in 1995 believing that pathogen inactivation would become the standard of care for global blood supplies.  Improving blood safety and availability and helping blood centers do everything in their power to protect patients has become my life’s work over the past 30 years.\n\nHistorically, blood safety has been addressed with reactive strategies such as testing donated blood and deferring blood donors that might pose a greater risk to the blood supply.  With pathogen inactivation, blood centers are now able to employ a proactive approach to protect the blood supply not only against known pathogens, but also emerging infectious disease threats like Zika virus, babesia, and, of course, SARS-COV2.  Cerus’ INTERCEPT Blood System also enables a rationalization of current blood safety measures that helps reduce costs for blood centers both today and in the future.\nOver the past 30 years, I have experienced multiple transfusion-transmitted disease threats to the blood industry. I'm here to answer any of your questions about how the transfusion medicine field may evolve in the next decade with the backdrop of the current pandemic, and what the future of blood safety and therapies might look like.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/YWouuyD\n\nAsk Me Anything! -- Thanks so much for joining me!
