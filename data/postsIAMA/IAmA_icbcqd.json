I've been a fellow at CDC for 2 years now. I graduated from the Rollins School of Public Health with my MPH in 2018.

Previous to this position, he has worked in the medical field as an EMT, and worked as a disaster response asset to wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters both on-the-ground and as a member of an Incident Management Team, which is a role he still fills as needed. Outside of field work, specializations include data analysis and machine learning using R.\n\n[/u/mmm\\_toasty](https://www.reddit.com/u/mmm_toasty/)\n\n&gt;Iâ€™m a 3rd-year PhD candidate studying data science, population health, and epidemiology. My research focuses on clinical predictive modeling and social determinants of health. I did my MS in computer science, focusing in machine learning and information visualization and my BS in computer science and linguistics.\n\n[/u/phealthy](https://www.reddit.com/u/phealthy/)\n\n&gt;I'm currently a PhD student studying ID Epidemiology. I have worked at the state, federal, and international levels as an epidemiologist for about 8 years. I'm also a returned Peace Corps volunteer.\n\n[/u/TheRussianFleet1863](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRussianFleet1863/)\n\n&gt;High school, army, electrical apprentice, record room manager/undergrad, PRA in rheumatology, help desk/MPH, PRA/data manager, PRA/PhD, instructor, assistant professor... that takes us from 1983 until today. I did my undergrad work in biology and anthropology, then my MPH in International Health and Development .My PhD work was in COPD so I call myself a thoracic epidemiologist or something like that. I'm in the academic research track so I'm 95% funded by grants, NIH or whomever will give them to me and my collaborators, 5% is from the department and it's used to pay for time spent on committees (school and dissertation), departmental business and other student interactions, I don't teach but I mentor.  \nMy interests are primarily diseases and exposures that manifest in the chest, lungs in particular just now but I've done a lot of work with the heart. My favorite exposure is cannabis which started out because a lot of people inhale it but that interest has spread beyond the lungs to look at DKA(t1d), sleep, sex, tertiary exposure to THC and a few other topics involving cannabis. My least favorite exposure is tobacco because it's so obviously bad and I hate to see well evolved organ systems like the lungs and heart failing due to smoking cigarettes. I've done a lot of research in COPD, especially in the interaction between COPD and type 2 diabetes and we completely redefined COPD as a disease but most people haven't noticed yet. My favorite unsolved epi mystery is; \"why don't people with type 1 diabetes show progressive microvascular complication effecting the lungs/breathing?\" My top three favorite books are; Sten (the series), The Vang and To Say Nothing of the Dog. I play banjo (poorly). I'm currently playing Graveyard Keeper and Assassin's Creed Odyssey and my Plex directory has 1,737 folders in it.\n\n[/u/webster1002](https://www.reddit.com/u/webster1002/) \\*\n\n&gt;webster1002 is a masters level epidemiologist who has been working in an academic / clinical research setting since graduating from an MPH program in NYC.
