I'm Takashi Doscher and I am the writer/director of the small indie film, ONLY, which has miraculously climbed the Netflix charts this past week, hitting #2 on Friday! \n\nThe film stars Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and Leslie Odom Jr., (Hamilton, Central Park). They play a couple trying to survive a pandemic that affects only women. (weird timing, I know). \n\nI wrote the first draft of the script 8 years ago, and it has been quite the journey to get the movie made, sold, and streaming on Netflix. Made completely independently, we premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in 2019 before eventually selling to a distributor called Vertical Entertainment. We had a limited theatrical release in March, which was basically shut down by the pandemic. Fast forward a few months, the movie releases on Netflix and (to my total shock) has been in the Netflix top ten since it's release. \n\nIf you are a US Netflix subscriber, you can now watch the film here: https://www.netflix.com/title/80206413\n\nHappy to answer any questions you may have about the film itself, the journey of being an indie filmmaker, or anything else! Cant wait to read your questions!",
