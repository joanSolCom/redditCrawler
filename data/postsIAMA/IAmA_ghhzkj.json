There are undoubtedly other paramedics and EMTs here that may poke their heads in. Please welcome their input as well.\n- I will not answer questions such as \"what's the worst thing you've ever seen\" or questions like it looking for gory stories. It's considered disrespectful to ask an EMT/Paramedic/Firefighter/etc that because it's asking us to rehash our worst nightmare. Also, most people don't really want the real answer. \n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/qZX88NC",
