I’m Dr Saira Ghafur from Imperial College London.\n\nWe are witnessing a rapid rise in the digitisation of healthcare, with great promises widely touted – better information sharing, greater access to health records, more personalised medicine, faster research and development. But do we understand the risks as well as the benefits? With an increasing reliance on digital, our health systems also become increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. \n\nThis is something that we’re seeing now more than ever. With systems under pressure due to COVID-19, more people working remotely with potentially sensitive files on home computers, and a heavy dependence on digital health tech to support remote care, hackers are taking advantage and launching cyber-attacks. \nAmong the targets are health systems and healthcare organisations; we’ve been tracking these attacks across the world so we can learn from them. Cyber security is critical for health services and patient safety, but it’s not something that is often given due attention or investment.\n\n**About my research**\n\nMy research aims to help people – everyone from the public, researchers, policymakers, healthcare professionals and government – to better understand the need for cyber resilience, and the implications of a cyber-attack on healthcare. At the moment we still don’t fully understand the full extent of damage that can result from an attack.\n\nWe’ve shown that the infamous 2017 WannaCry cyber-attack cost NHS hospitals in England at least £5.9 million. And facing a paucity of data, that calculation was not able to account for costs to primary or social care, or patient harm. \n\nSo we have an incomplete picture of the trail of destruction these acts may leave. It’s important that we learn from these events so that we can understand the future challenges that must be considered before embarking on integrating new digital products into health systems.\n\nOur recent white paper on cyber security in healthcare is a step towards that goal, and we’ve made key recommendations to help health systems better prepare and protect themselves against the threat of an attack. \n\nBut it’s not one person, one system or one government that needs to act; cyber hygiene is a collective responsibility. And we can learn from each other’s successes and mistakes to ensure a safer future for our health systems, and the people whose lives depend on them.  \n\n**Key papers**\n\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/institute-of-global-health-innovation/Cyber-report-2020.pdf \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30005-6/fulltext\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0161-6\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2381 \n\n**Proof**: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1272541536614522880\n\n**UPDATE [17.42PM BST]**: Thanks very much everyone for your great questions.
