I've worked in NHS hospital mortuaries, and in public mortuaries under the control of a Coroner. \n\n**A bit of background:** we look after any deceased person brought into our care, and during post mortem sessions, we assist the (sometimes forensic) pathologist by undressing the deceased, removing all of the organs (including the brain if required), and then stitching the deceased up, followed by washing, drying and shrouding. I have worked with decomposed cases, heavily traumatised cases, suicides, a wide variety of ages, forensic cases/murders, and lots of other interesting things.\n\nI am happy to respectfully answer as many of your questions as best as I can, whether they're about our care of the deceased, more technical questions about what happens during post mortems, more gruesome questions about what happens to the human body after death, or anything you are curious about.\n\nI've sent proof of ID and my qualifications to the mods as I'd prefer to stay anonymous, both for personal reasons and in order to respect the privacy of the deceased on whom I've worked in the past, and their loved ones.\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: I’m going to bed now but will answer any more questions tomorrow! Have a great evening everyone and thank you for your interest.",
