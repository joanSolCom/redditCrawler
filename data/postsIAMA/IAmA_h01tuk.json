I became a USFSA gold medalist at the age of fourteen. I have competed in singles for fourteen consecutive seasons, as well as five seasons doing synchronized skating, and I have experience in both solo and partnered ice dance. I have also done some professional work, appearing in TV episodes of \"Sesame Street\", \"Instinct\", and \"Mysteries of Laura\", and various skatewear modeling jobs. I am a performing apprentice with the Ice Theater of New York, and I have appeared in some of their exhibitions, both as an ensemble member and a soloist. \n\nYou can find me on instagram if you want to see my skating, [https://www.instagram.com/georgieonice/](https://www.instagram.com/georgieonice/)\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/65RKr6V](https://imgur.com/a/65RKr6V)",
