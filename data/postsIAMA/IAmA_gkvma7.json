I work at Ubisoft Montréal as an online software programmer for the Assassin's Creed Brand. I have been in the industry for a couple of years now, from indies to AAA companies. Less than a year ago, I decided to start with some friends an indie game studio, outside of Ubisoft, to produce our own game. It has been and it is a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences as running a business is very different from the day-to-day job. [As of today, our little studio has reached 10 people working on the game](https://madlifegames.com/about).\n\nI'm here with Mackly Férère-Antoine as u/sh-dz who is working as well at Ubisoft. He is an animation programmer on For Honor and also co-founder of Madlife. We will answer some of your questions as well!\n\nAsk us all kind of questions:\n\n\\- What are the trend in the industry?\n\n\\- How to start a game studio?\n\n\\- How do we manage both work at the same time?\n\n\\- What brand of coffee I'm drinking right now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start this! Ask me anything!\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/dafedidi/status/1261665065184505859](https://twitter.com/dafedidi/status/1261665065184505859)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** *It's been an amazing 7 hours with you guys. Thank you very much to everyone that participated, upvoted, asked questions and commented. Stay safe! - Daryl B.* ",
