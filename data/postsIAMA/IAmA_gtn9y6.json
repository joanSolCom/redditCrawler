It is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking.\n\nI will be making video posts as I was getting sicker leading up to me being locked in and then my miraculous recovery.\n\nEveryone thought I was “Brain dead” not in the clinical sense of the term could hear and see the entire time.

I was expected to die on New years eve 2017\n\n. I was both completely locked in and in a pseudo-coma for approximately six months\n\n. I survived six months of home care hospice on comfort measures only\n\n. I was fully aware the entire time \n\n. I slowly showed my first￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ signs of doctors thinking I might be “in there“ By beginning to be able to blink and a minor movement in my right wrist\n\n. In the mid July 2018 I became virtually locked in I could blink for no￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ and stick out my tongue for yes\n\n.
