We have a whole slate of exciting talks and accompanying AMAs with the panelists.\n\nLast up for today is [Power and Projections of Trauma in the 19th and 20th Centuries Panel Q&amp;A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVLNFeM89Kw)\n\nThis panel explores how power is performed through the creation and distribution of propaganda, and the ways in which this propaganda is used to express the traumatic experiences of others.\n\n#[Click through here for the AMA with the panelists](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/iu2g11/power_and_projections_of_trauma_in_the_19th_and/)\n\n&gt; Moderated by **Lisa Baer-Tsarfati** (/u/historiagrephour), it explores the marginalization of Indigenous Americans, British and Chinese women, and Chinese youth.\n&gt; \n&gt; It features:\n&gt; \n&gt; **Adam Franti** (/u/PartyMoses), presenting his paper, **“His Gallant Soul Had Fled: Death, Remembrance, and Race in Early America”**.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Reporting the death of generals and admirals in the wars of the long 18th century followed particular patterns and were written for political purposes. Generals lying slain on the field were venerated, celebrated, represented as central to victory or nobility in defeat. Reports, from military dispatches to newspaper accounts, imitated stylistic components from earlier deaths, creating a self-referential genre of death. The pattern changes markedly when applied to the deaths of Native leaders. While similar in style and veneration, the death of Native leaders initiated long-term squabbles over the identity of the man or men responsible, and served as a way to turn the Native struggle into one that reflects white values over Native.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *This paper contrasts the death reports of prominent white leaders such as James Wolfe, Isaac Brock, and Edward Pakenham with those of prominent native leaders such as Metacomet and Tecumseh, and explores the racial dimensions of military propaganda.*\n&gt; \n&gt; **Katie Truax** (/u/historyfrombelow), presenting her paper, **“Dealing with Catastrophe: Medical Men and the Diseases of Women in 19th-Century Britain”**.\n&gt; \n&gt; *This paper discusses descriptions of catastrophe in women’s bodies in the medical field in 19th-century Britain. In the first half of the century, before medical school and the medical field were codified and institutionalized, medical men struggled to deal with the diseases of women. Handling gynaecological issues was complicated by the limits of propriety in patient interactions and the limited knowledge of women’s bodies and diseases. Furthermore, the field was often cutthroat and difficult to earn a living in, leading to a continuous effort to create a narrative about women’s bodies and diseases that removed culpability from physicians, protected their reputations, and justified experimentation. This historical moment sheds light on the conflict that can arise between medical professionals, their patients, and their public perception when catastrophic medical events occur. The diseases became “incurable,” the women were blameworthy, and the uncertainty and fatality created long-term effects in the field of gynaecology.*\n&gt; \n&gt; **Dr. Stephanie Montgomery** (/u/dr_smm), presenting her paper, **“‘A Den of Monsters’: Women, Crime, and the City in 1930s China”**.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Emerging out of the chaos of revolution, the Republic of China founded in 1911 faced a dizzying number of obstacles to consolidating power across the former Qing empire. By 1927, the Republican government had gained tenuous control over some eastern coastal cities, launching social, cultural, and political campaigns with mixed results. At the same time, writers in the popular press wrote prolifically on the pervasiveness of crime in Republican-held cities, with special attention to the problem of women’s crime.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *This paper examines how popular writers in the 1920s and 1930s imagined women’s crime as an unfolding catastrophe in a rapidly changing society. Their conversation fit into a larger genre of heated debate during this period: the discussion of uneducated, illiterate, foot-bound Chinese women who were economically dependent on men, widely known as the “woman problem” debate. Likewise, in writing on women criminals, popular writers used sociological studies, criminology, and pseudoscience to argue for women's socioeconomic vulnerability, but also their biological predisposition to crime. Influenced by theories of social Darwinism, they concluded that women’s crime was a threat to the domestic sphere, the Chinese race, and to the very future of building a modern Chinese society.*\n&gt; \n&gt; **Dr. Melissa Brzycki** (/u/mel_brzycki), presenting her paper, **“Young People in the Chinese Great Leap Forward and its Aftermath, 1958–1962”**.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Nine years after the foundation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, state officials initiated the Great Leap Forward (1958–1961), an attempt to rapidly transform the country into a socialist, industrial powerhouse, using increased agricultural production to fund industrialization. The Great Leap Forward constituted a disruption to the lives of all Chinese people, not only because it necessitated the mobilization of all members of society, including children, but also because of the famine (1959-1961) that resulted from Great Leap Forward policies. This deadly famine caused widespread starvation and malnutrition, killing tens of millions of people.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *There are relatively few sources that contain the voices and experiences of young people during this period. However, according to official records, the rate at which young people—some as young as 10 or 11 years old—were committing crimes in the late 1950s and early 1960s seems to have been increasing. State records make no connection between these crimes, which include theft and speaking out against state policies, and the Great Leap Forward and famine, but as historians, we can use these accounts to glean some insight into how young people may have reacted to this period of starvation and scarcity.*",
