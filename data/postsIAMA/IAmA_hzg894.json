Excited for my first AMA. My name is Martin Chalifour, I am Principal Concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and teach at Caltech and the USC Thornton School of Music. \n\nI have also performed with the Mainly Mozart Festival Orchestra in San Diego for the past thirty years. Mainly Mozart's orchestra is a collection of the country's top orchestral players and a true symbol of musical excellence. On July 11, Mainly Mozart put on the first live classical concert in the U.S. (presented by a major arts organization) in front of a live audience since quarantine began. It was an emotional experience to be back performing in my first concert since mid-March. \n\nI also have infectious disease expert Dr. Philippe Prokocimer here with me (not in person!) to answer any questions you may have regarding the safety of drive-in concerts. Dr. Prokocimer went to medical school in Paris, France, and did his post-doctoral studies at Stanford University's School of Medicine in the 80s and did important work during the AIDs crisis, tuberculosis and antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe arts are so incredibly important, if you're able, please consider donating to help us Keep Live Music Alive. You can do so  at [mainlymozart.org/donate](https://www.mainlymozart.org/donate).\n\nCheck [mainlymozart.org](https://www.mainlymozart.org) for details.\n\nYou can follow Mainly Mozart on at [facebook.com/mainlymozart](https://www.facebook.com/mainlymozart), [instagram.com/mainlymozart](https://www.instagram.com/mainlymozart) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGbDET38AWa8qZSYwqctong\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/JKDF1tb",
