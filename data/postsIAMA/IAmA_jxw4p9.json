We are launching an AI and we will be hosting an AMA to explain what is going on.\n\n**The AI**: Locationbot will have a new friend - the Reddit Eviction help bot.\n\nThe Eviction Help Bot uses the legal issue spotter [Spot](https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/) which was initially developed by the Suffolk Law School [Legal Innovation &amp; Technology Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/) in conjunction with Stanford Law School's [Legal Design Lab](https://law.stanford.edu/organizations/pages/legal-design-lab/). ***Spot is essentially an \"AI\" or \"learning Machine\" which was developed using questions and answers posted right here on*** [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/). The questions were then run through a [game played by law students and other legal professionals](https://learnedhands.law.stanford.edu/).  In the course of this game the players taught Spot to identify legal  issues when they were written in normal conversational English by  regular OPs.\n\nThe bot is deployed when Spot identifies a message or a question on [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)  to be related to housing. If the legal issue in a message is identified  as a housing issue, then the bot responds by referring the user to the [legalfaq platform](https://legalfaq.org/).  Legal FAQ provides users with jurisdiction specific information  regarding eviction on a local, state and federal level. The platform  functions as a ‘front door’, it provides users basic orientation on  their rights and then hands them off to service providers who can help  them.\n\nBecause Spot is a learning  machine as there are more interactions with it, it will grow smarter and  be better able to help people looking for legal assistance.\n\n**The AMA**\n\nOn  Friday, November 20th at 4pm ET/1PM PT members of Stanford's Legal  Design Lab,  Suffolk's Legal Innovation and Technology Lab, and yours  truly will answer any questions you may have about this bot, legal AI in  general, how learning machines work, and anything else that strikes  your fancy.\n\nFrom Stanford Law School in Palo Alto California:\n\n* Margaret  Hagan: Margaret Hagan is the Executive Director of the Stanford Legal  Design Lab, working to bring law &amp; design together. Margaret holds a  JD from Stanford Law, as well as an AB from the University of Chicago,  an MA from Central European University in Budapest, and a PhD from  Queen’s University Belfast in International Politics.\n* Nóra  Al Haider: Nóra Al Haider is the Lab’s Policy and Design Lead. She is  interested in combining the fields of law, tech and design to find  human-centred solutions for complex problems. Nóra holds a Bachelor  (honours) and Research Master in Law from Utrecht University.\n* Metin  Eskili: Metin Eskili is the Lab’s developer and technologist. He is a  full-stack developer who builds access to justice technology for us to  implement and research. Metin holds a bachelor degree in computer  engineering from Turkey.\n\nFrom Suffolk Law School in Boston, Massachusetts:\n\n* David  Colarusso, Director of the Legal Innovation and Technology Lab. David  Colarusso is the Director of Suffolk University Law School's Legal  Innovation and Technology Lab. An attorney and educator by training, he  has worked as a public defender, data scientist, software engineer, and  high school physics teacher.\n* Quinten  Steenhuis, Clinical Fellow. Steenhuis is a clinical fellow in the Legal  Innovation and Technology Lab. Quinten has practiced housing and  eviction defense law since 2008, and has been a professional programmer  and web application developer since 2001. He speaks at area law schools  and blogs frequently on the topic of legal technology. He works on  projects addressing social justice and access to justice with technology  focusing on the topic of housing and evictions.\n\nIn  light of the late Friday nature of the AMA I'm going to leave this post  up for any questions starting now and they will be answered starting  Friday at 4pm ET/1pm PT.
