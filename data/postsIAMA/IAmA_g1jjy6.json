The last 15, I’ve been the Creative Director of Boomzap, a virtual studio where the entire staff works from home from around the world, mostly Southeast Asia. We’ve made a bunch of cool casual games, such as *Awakening*, *Dana Knightstone*, and *Rescue Quest*. We’ve also made mobile puzzle games like *Super Awesome Quest* and cross platform strategy games like *Legends of Callasia*. Overall, we’ve shipped about 50 titles across multiple platforms from PC to console.\n\nRight now we have a new strategy game in Steam Early Access: *Last Regiment*. It’s a sort of hybrid of card games and turn-based strategy, set in a Enlightenment-period inspired fantasy setting. Think frigates, musketeers, goblin dirigibles, elves with chainsaws, and cool stuff like that. It’s pretty cool. \n\nWith everyone is trying to work from home these days, I have been getting a LOT of questions about how we run our studio. To help out, I took a weekend and learned how to make videos, and made a 5 video series about working from home. It’s called [15 Years Without Pants](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaft76eiDidQiMjzOchsTmmDL5RBiJrK9), and it may be useful to people looking to start their own virtual studio in the aftermath of this global pandemic. It’s on YouTube, and free. I’m here to answer questions about the videos, and help people make the transition to working from home better. Ask Me Anything!\n\n[Proof:](https://twitter.com/boomzap/status/1250251957324800000)\n\n**EDIT**\nI have had a few people ask me about breaking into the game industry. I get that question a LOT. So I made a video a couple months ago with a really, really complete answer. Feel free to check that out, too:\n\n[Breaking Into the Game Industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nxo8fZSX-U&amp;list=PLaft76eiDidSVm-8lsSHfDSL0x9zYftcJ&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s&amp;loop=0)\n\n**ANOTHER EDIT**\nOK - I am gonna crash - it's midnight-30 here. This was amazing fun, and lots of great questions. I'll log in in the morning and answer any questions that show up after I sleep. \n\nIf you ever want more info/ideas, I am always on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VQPuk7N)\n\nAnd for people who asked about our latest multiplayer strategy game, it's in Early Access on Steam - it's called [Last Regiment](https://store.steampowered.com/app/845050/Last_Regiment/)",
