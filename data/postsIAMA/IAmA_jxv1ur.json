I’m Melody Schreiber, a freelance journalist covering everything from the effects of climate change on mental health in the Arctic to the changing tides of livelihoods in the Chesapeake Bay. Most recently, I published a book of personal essays by writers who had or were premature babies. When my water broke three months early, I did what I’ve always done in times of stress—I looked for books. I wanted to find a book that reflected all of the complicated feelings of premature birth in intimate stories, and I couldn’t find it. So, I made it—What We Didn’t Expect: Personal Stories of Premature Birth.\n\nLiving through my son’s prematurity and health complications also inspired me to become a postpartum doula. I completed my training through DONA, the largest professional organization of birth and postpartum doulas.\n\nOne in ten babies are born premature, which means 400,000 families in the U.S. welcome premature babies every year. Since November is Prematurity Awareness Month, ask me anything!\n\nLearn more about the book: [https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/what-we-didnt-expect/](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/what-we-didnt-expect/)\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/m\\_scribe/status/1329450842953555979](https://twitter.com/m_scribe/status/1329450842953555979)\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your questions!
