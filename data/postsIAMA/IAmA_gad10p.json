My company went to 90 conventions in the last 12 months and I hope we’ll be returning to doing so after conventions resume. We’ve sold board games at a variety of conventions: PAX, Anime NYC, New York ComicCon, AnthroCon, Otakon,  Origins, Gen Con, local roller derby events, and many more. In the past 11 years, I’ve gone to over 250 conventions and my company has gone to over 600. I’ve served as staff on a variety of shows running their tabletop gaming programs and other various logistics jobs. We run a pin trading program, Pin Bazaar, at several large gaming and anime conventions and also do a variety of overseas manufacturing for ourselves and other customers.\n\nWe’ve also done 13 Kickstarter projects for dice and other gaming accessories, including most recently one for metal pride flag dice.
