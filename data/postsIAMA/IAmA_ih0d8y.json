        "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nMy name is Nelson A Paguyo, and I am a retired physician. I have worked in medicine here in the US since emigrating from the Philippines in 1963. I specialized in Pulmonology and practiced internal medicine and have twenty years in solo practice and thirteen years as a member of an HMO. Through my career, I have first-handedly witnessed the evolution of healthcare from the ART &amp; SCIENCE OF MEDICINE to the BUSINESS OF MEDICINE where, unfortunately, money and profits are more valued than patient care. I am joined today by my granddaughters who have tried to explain to me what reddit is and encouraged me to try an AMA. They will be helping me with the technology and will type my responses out for me. [Proof that it is me](https://i.ibb.co/yqx6t6K/366962.jpg).\n\nOriginally written in 2007, I have recently republished the [4th edition of my book, \"Healthcare for All Americans\"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DQQNVVB/) this year. It's a comprehensive universal healthcare plan that covers details on how we can implement and finance a truly universal healthcare for America. The plan is a hybrid approach of Medicare for All, combining government and the nature of the free-market to reduce and control the cost of insurance.\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has significantly shed a light on the circumstances of the United States' broken healthcare system. Many Americans are more aware of the rising costs of healthcare in this country and are wondering why there isn't universal coverage like many other countries around the world. Ask me anything about my book, my experiences as an immigrant doctor, the evolution of healthcare in America, and my ideas for Universal Healthcare/Medicare for All!\n\nMore Links:  \n[Healthcare for All Americans: Health Crisis USA--A Comprehensive Solution on GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54961537-healthcare-for-all-americans)  \n\n[Doxomity Profile](https://www.doximity.com/pub/nelson-paguyo-md)\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the questions!
