You may remember me as the Spytalk columnist for years at Newsweek, and before that, at The Washington Post and before that Congressional Quarterly (where I was also the founding editor of the ground-breaking daily CQ/Homeland Security). \n\nNow, I have rebooted [SpyTalk](https://spytalk.substack.com), the national security and intelligence column, which was once was a Newsweek mainstay, as a newsletter on the Substack platform. You can follow along as I lead an all-star team of veteran investigative reporters, writers and subject-matter experts who will take you behind the scenes of the national security state. \n\nSubscribers can expect to see in-depth original reporting and analysis plus a mix of insider items and scooplets plucked from overlooked congressional hearing transcripts, GAO (Government Accountability Office) and IG (Inspector General) reports and the release of declassified documents and think tank studies. \n\nOur latest feature story, [The Diplomat and the Cage Fighter](https://spytalk.substack.com/p/the-diplomat-and-the-cage-fighter), *exclusively* revealed that Trump appointee and former acting Director of National Intelligence, Richard Grenell, worked to help Moroccan-German UFC fighter Abu Azaitar secure a visa after previously being denied three times because of his criminal record.\n\nYou can read more of SpyTalk [here](https://spytalk.substack.com).
