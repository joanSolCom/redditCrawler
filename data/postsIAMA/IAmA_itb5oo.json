Since [my first AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gx5w65/i_am_a_19_year_old_artisan_baker_from_south/) a few months ago, quite a few thing have happened. \n\nFor one, I turned 20! But perhaps more importantly my [first Sourdough Course &amp; Cookbook](https://www.udemy.com/course/achievesourdoughmastery/?couponCode=BAKESOURDOUGH) launched and to date has allowed me to share my love of Sourdough Baking with over 500 students across Udemy &amp; Skillshare. A [few articles](https://mashable.com/shopping/aug-18-sourdough-bread-and-pastry-course-sale/) were also written about my course, one even made it in my [local newspaper](https://imgur.com/a/0E2NrID) which was incredibly humbling to experience.\n\nSince then I've been hard at work on my new Course &amp; Cookbook, this time on making [**Pastries &amp; Desserts using Sourdough Starter! It just recently released!**](https://www.udemy.com/course/artisan-pastry-for-beginners/?couponCode=LEARNPASTRY)\n\nIt's been a lot of fun learning new things with these recipes which at first were completely out of my comfort zone, as well as taking the lessons learnt from my first course and using that knowledge to (hopefully) have improved this new one. So with that said, I'd love to share any insights that might be of interest from Sourdough to Baking and even Writing. So AMA!\n\n[My Proof](https://imgur.com/a/BreioP9)",
