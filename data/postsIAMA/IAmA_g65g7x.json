In 2003 I retired from the US Navy Reserve after 20 years and had developed a strong affinity for the ocean. Fortunately, I had become financially successful investing in industrial private equity and was looking for a difficult challenge that required a lot of unique resources.

After a five-year intensive effort, my team was able to precisely locate, map, and then get me down to the bottom of all five. We have continued our explorations in 2020 with dives in the Mediterranean and Red Seas and are headed back to the Pacific for more diving in the Mariana Trench.
