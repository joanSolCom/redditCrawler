My new book, The Great Indoors: The Surprising Science of How Buildings Shape Our Behavior, Health, and Happiness, will be published in June. (You can read more about the book, and pre-order it, here: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374716684.) The book is an adventure into the buildings in which we spend our days, exploring the profound, and sometimes unexpected, ways that they shape our lives. It happens to touch on a lot of topics that are especially relevant in the era of COVID-19, including: how to reduce the spread of pathogens indoors, the psychological and health effects of isolation, confinement, and sensory deprivation, how to stay healthy and sane while cooped up at home, how to design hospitals for an era of epidemics,  and the longstanding connection between architecture and public health.\n\nI also venture into an operating room designed to minimize medical errors, a lab that’s surveying all the microbial DNA that’s present in our house dust, an elementary school designed to nudge kids into being more active, a high-tech office that’s turned white-collar workers into scientific guinea pigs, and a prison designed to support inmates’ psychological needs. And I consider how buildings will shape our future, from smart homes that monitor our health to amphibious floating houses that could help us survive climate change. I even take a brief, long-distance look at the ice-covered domes we might find ourselves erecting on Mars.\n\nI’m also the author of Frankenstein’s Cat: Cuddling Up to Biotech’s Brave New Beasts, and my stories have appeared in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Wired, Nature, Slate, Businessweek, and elsewhere.\n\nYou can check out my website [here](http://emilyanthes.com/), follow me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/emilyanthes), and subscribe to my newsletter [here](https://emilyanthes.substack.com/).\n\nAMA!\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/arsipzdk93t41.jpg\n\nEDIT (4/21, 4:00 p.m.): Thank you all for the great questions!
