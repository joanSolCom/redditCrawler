I’ve also starred in films such as Emelie and The Spiderwick Chronicles.\n \nAnd while I’m more than happy to chat about any of my prior or current roles, I’d love to talk about my role of Sarah, the lead in Abner Pastoll’s thriller A GOOD WOMAN IS HARD TO FIND, which is currently available through Film Movement’s Virtual Cinema, as well as On Demand and Digital (iTunes, Amazon, Vudu).  I star as a struggling single mother, desperate to discover who murdered my husband in front of my young son, leaving him mute.  The local cops haven’t done a thing, and I’m barely getting by.  One day, after being coerced into helping a local drug dealer, who has stolen narcotics the neighborhood kingpin, I’m forced to take drastic action to protect the things I hold dear – my children.  Although the film took me to some dark places I never expected to be, I truly enjoyed such a challenging role unlike any I’ve ever had before.
