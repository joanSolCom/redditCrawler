Our minds are malleable because of an evolutionary need for survival by being social animals and by being influenced by others and to be able to influence others originally for our own safety, but it can also be used to put us in grave danger without our awareness and by somebody who is all too good at manipulation, like Keith, knowing how to take the breaks off of the runaway train that is in our minds. So it’s a bigger question than what makes Keith tick and why India found herself in this horrible situation because it’s about what we all need to recognize in our minds that we need to learn how to protect. Seduction isn’t just sexual. Seduction is a form of intense manipulation that lowers our boundaries and draws us in as though we are in a trance because somebody has tapped into the part of our brain that is the same part of the brain that can make you feel like you’re high off a drug and it quiets the parts of the brain that are our safety nets that engage our critical thinking and our reasoning and judgment. We have to learn, no matter how appealing and forceful the seduction seems to be, to consistently keep that part of our brain working and awake in order to keep us safe. If you know you’re potentially prone to this kind of influence, make sure to surround yourself with people who will help bring you back down to earth and help you see what’s happening and take in all the evidence of your senses and people who will gently but consistently help you take your blinders off. Manipulators know how to put our blinders on and sometimes when we want the magic they’re offering to be true and real, we keep those blinders on longer than is safe for us to do so. This is part of the human condition and we need to understand it as such and not blame the victim, but learn to protect ourselves from those who want to play on and prey on our susceptibility to influence. -RB",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will ask the victims of cults how they could let this happen to them, but people don’t often ask why it is that all of us are prone given the right set of circumstances to be seduced, to be influenced, to do things that are wrong for us, dangerous for us and against our better instincts. Our minds are malleable because of an evolutionary need for survival by being social animals and by being influenced by others and to be able to influence others originally for our own safety, but it can also be used to put us in grave danger without our awareness and by somebody who is all too good at manipulation, like Keith, knowing how to take the breaks off of the runaway train that is in our minds. So it’s a bigger question than what makes Keith tick and why India found herself in this horrible situation because it’s about what we all need to recognize in our minds that we need to learn how to protect. Seduction isn’t just sexual. Seduction is a form of intense manipulation that lowers our boundaries and draws us in as though we are in a trance because somebody has tapped into the part of our brain that is the same part of the brain that can make you feel like you’re high off a drug and it quiets the parts of the brain that are our safety nets that engage our critical thinking and our reasoning and judgment. We have to learn, no matter how appealing and forceful the seduction seems to be, to consistently keep that part of our brain working and awake in order to keep us safe. If you know you’re potentially prone to this kind of influence, make sure to surround yourself with people who will help bring you back down to earth and help you see what’s happening and take in all the evidence of your senses and people who will gently but consistently help you take your blinders off. Manipulators know how to put our blinders on and sometimes when we want the magic they’re offering to be true and real, we keep those blinders on longer than is safe for us to do so. This is part of the human condition and we need to understand it as such and not blame the victim, but learn to protect ourselves from those who want to play on and prey on our susceptibility to influence. -RB&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

DOS was a way of showing your success by being specially chosen and making you feel that this was your way to develop your strength and resolve and commitment after which you might then think you’ll be allowed to go back on track to move farther up in the executive levels. But of course that decision will ultimately be up to Keith and once again he will convince you he knows what’s best for you. Keith also did not need for people to move up certain levels to make more money from the group and for the group as much as an MLM does because he was being bank rolled and had money to spare. - RB",

DOS was a way of showing your success by being specially chosen and making you feel that this was your way to develop your strength and resolve and commitment after which you might then think you’ll be allowed to go back on track to move farther up in the executive levels. But of course that decision will ultimately be up to Keith and once again he will convince you he knows what’s best for you. Keith also did not need for people to move up certain levels to make more money from the group and for the group as much as an MLM does because he was being bank rolled and had money to spare. - RB&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That’s how strong and dangerous coercive manipulation is. It’s driving them to the point of social suicide while they protect a convicted predator. That’s what I’ll say to that. -IO&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For me, at first, talk therapy was very triggering and not helpful so I worked with a woman named Diane Benscoter. She helped me immensely to rebuild my critical thinking and reconnect me back to myself. She did it in such a gentle and kind way that it helped me start to be able to talk about things that at first, I couldn’t even express in words. I’ve also done a lot of therapy since then with Rachel Bernstein. Reading my mother’s book showed me a lot of the truths that were being hidden from me when I was in NXIVM and was also very healing. \n\nI’ve also gotten back into sports like boxing, which has helped me process a lot of my anxiety and anger but on top of it, has helped me rebuild my muscles, strength, and confidence. So like I said, it’s been a lot of things. I think one day I’ll write a whole list of them. That also includes books, documentaries, podcasts, you name it… I was really on a mission to figure it out. \n\nChanel Miller’s “Know My Name” was a stunning book about resilience and the differences between surviving and how people perceive victims that most people don’t get to see. Another huge book was “She Said” about the women that broke the Weinstein story. It broke down and exposed the system of predatory behavior. I mean, there’s so many. Even reading Maya Angelou’s “Letter to my Daughter” was healing. Whatever helped connect me back to who I am, I found helpful. -IO",

For me, at first, talk therapy was very triggering and not helpful so I worked with a woman named Diane Benscoter. She helped me immensely to rebuild my critical thinking and reconnect me back to myself. She did it in such a gentle and kind way that it helped me start to be able to talk about things that at first, I couldn’t even express in words. I’ve also done a lot of therapy since then with Rachel Bernstein. Reading my mother’s book showed me a lot of the truths that were being hidden from me when I was in NXIVM and was also very healing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve also gotten back into sports like boxing, which has helped me process a lot of my anxiety and anger but on top of it, has helped me rebuild my muscles, strength, and confidence. So like I said, it’s been a lot of things. I think one day I’ll write a whole list of them. That also includes books, documentaries, podcasts, you name it… I was really on a mission to figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chanel Miller’s “Know My Name” was a stunning book about resilience and the differences between surviving and how people perceive victims that most people don’t get to see. Another huge book was “She Said” about the women that broke the Weinstein story. It broke down and exposed the system of predatory behavior. I mean, there’s so many. Even reading Maya Angelou’s “Letter to my Daughter” was healing. Whatever helped connect me back to who I am, I found helpful. -IO&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It’s so hard to know the truth of everybody’s culpability because so many people were trained to lie to protect Keith. As for Claire, I don’t believe she knew anything about DOS beforehand, but she knew about plenty of Keith’s crimes that she supported financially and she was abusive to many people, especially those she employed. As for Nancy, I don’t know if she knew about DOS either but once again, she knew about Keith’s behavior from the beginning and it’s possible that Keith spun them alternative stories and concealed the truth but it’s hard for me to believe that given how close a relationship they all had. Nancy also knew about both of her daughters having sexual relationships with Keith so once again, it’s up to us to decide how much we believe they really knew or not and obviously, the court will have final say. -IO",

It’s so hard to know the truth of everybody’s culpability because so many people were trained to lie to protect Keith. As for Claire, I don’t believe she knew anything about DOS beforehand, but she knew about plenty of Keith’s crimes that she supported financially and she was abusive to many people, especially those she employed. As for Nancy, I don’t know if she knew about DOS either but once again, she knew about Keith’s behavior from the beginning and it’s possible that Keith spun them alternative stories and concealed the truth but it’s hard for me to believe that given how close a relationship they all had. Nancy also knew about both of her daughters having sexual relationships with Keith so once again, it’s up to us to decide how much we believe they really knew or not and obviously, the court will have final say. -IO&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I remember thinking oh god, what if when he says my name they throw tomatoes...and how would they get tomatoes...my brain was panicking and going so fast. And then he said my name it must have been a good G4 crossover day because it was so amazing and so welcoming.\n\nThen we went to go tape and I remember my piece in the first section of the show so I had to stand off to the right if you're looking at Jon's desk, in the dark. So I stood there for the whole intro, and then he did his first piece and was going to throw it over to me. So I was standing the dark, and then heard that Daily Show music and my heart dropped further into my stomach, it was such a surreal moment. And then I remember starting to feel light headed, and realized the entire time I wasn't breathing...so I finally took a breath. It was just SO many feelings - and that feeling of excitement never went away.\n\nBefore every show everyone's writing all day long, then rehearsal, then there's a small window before the audience comes out. In between that rehearsal and live to tape, Jon goes into this small little office - and if you're on the show or written you get to come in. And he just walks back and forth and edits everything, it was so fascinating to watch. Every edit just made it cleaner, sharper, funnier - I learned so much from him.",
