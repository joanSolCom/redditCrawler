        "body": "I respect how thorough you’ve been, but I also think you’ve jumped to a lot of conclusions. The NYTs was also thorough in having me provide evidence for anything I stated, and I gave a number of emails, texts, and other documents to back up my statements. That said, here we go:\n\n1. “The **hospital says a supervisor suggested that Mr. Witt skip only part of the day because of the surge in patients.”**\n\nI found out, via text while at work, that a nurse had been written up for “a data breach” and that their hearing was to be held the next day. They were being given a discipline that could result in their termination. I handle those cases. As I was working, it took an extended exchange between myself and HR to clarify details (since I’m also doing my job as a nurse). We were also doing the discipline remotely, which was entirely new to me.\n\nI went to talk to my manager, and they were having a conversation with another nurse. I didn’t want to interrupt and said I needed to speak with them before they left. My manager called my work phone two hours later, as I was in the middle of dealing with a critical patient. I explained I needed to use a union day, the reason why, and that I was dealing with a very sick patient. My manager said lets work out a deal while I was (correctly) being pressured by a doctor and a radiologist to deal with my patient. After trying to figure something out, I ultimately had to prioritize patient care, and told my manager that I needed to use the union day. That was the end of the conversation.\n\nMy manager never sought me out for the rest of my shift. I sent an email to verify that I was taking a union day. I did not get a response to that email. I never got a text or call the next day asking me to come in. ED staffing was OK, as we had very sick patients but otherwise a low census, since people were not coming to the hospital for the little things they might normally.\n\n2) “The last thing anyone wants is more mistrust in the hospitals or a real understanding how bad things are to cause a public panic. Just out of curiosity, did you get such an email?”\n\nI didn’t, but no one should know the standards the staff in hospitals are being subjected to, as hospital staff die across the world because of a lack of protection? We fundamentally disagree on this one.\n\n3) “So you knew relations between the Union\\\\Staff and HR were delicate. I assume because of all the issues that you had mentioned from the merger; the payroll and benefits. Which by your own admission all occured last year.”\n\nNo, some occurred last year and people still have problems, especially regarding pay. The PTO audit happened in the middle of the pandemic. The relationship was worsened over the constantly changing PPE standards, and a PTO audit that occurred in the middle of a pandemic.\n\n4) “Makes sense, you are a union lead for the hospital, you should have direct access to this person to ensure the nurses needs are met. But could it be that these people were busy dealing with a crisis that affects a substantially large health system?”\n\nAnd the issues I was bringing to them were directly related to dealing with the pandemic, especially the safety/standards of the people I represent as well as patient safety.\n\n5) “Clearly the there was tension already, so it wasnt going well. But let me ask you, do you feel you are the only one that has a lot to deal with? Is it appropriate to throw more problems, especially those related to a significant portion of their front line staff, on top of hospital leadership while the hospitals is in the middle of a crisis when you should be doing everything in your power to smooth over the situation until a time where these issues can be resolved. Possibly under normal conditions?”\n\nSee my answer to #4. No, these things couldn’t wait and I’d be bad at doing my job if I let them.\n\n6) “Now im not saying resolving a PTO discrepancy isnt important, but what is so critical that it has to be done now? No one is going on vacation anytime soon.”\n\nSick time also comes out of PTO. As I explained, a lot of people’s time off bank went into the negative due to an HR error. Nurses have since had medical issues on the job but tried to keep working because they knew if they went home they wouldn’t get paid. PTO matters right now.\n\n7) “I agree with your leadership, they are pretty busy now. I would think. I mean its a crisis.”\n\nIt’s a crisis that is effecting the staff as well. I represent them. I let management know what’s going on.\n\n8) \"I somehow dont think your hospital is the only place that has centralized distribution of equipment in low supply. The last thing they want is self regulation to burn through what little they have. Dont me wrong here, its a dangerous situation. Stupid dangerous in fact to both patients and the staff. But do you really think a department that previously didnt think twice about the PPE availability should have the same access as now?”\n\nIf you lock supplies up, how is staff supposed to access them when they’re needed? Do they not treat a patient that’s condition has changed or, alternatively, do they risk their own health instead?\n\n9) “Seriously? You found a good time to make demands.”\n\nAdequate PPE, fixing our PTO, talking to the union leadership, and hazard pay are not insane demands. Local groceries and other businesses are giving raises to their employees right now, and it’s appropriate given their risk. Nurses and healthcare workers deserve the same.\n\n10) “You may have warned your manager, but that doesnt mean it was approved. Sounds to me like you went AWOL.”\n\nNo. There is very explicit language in the contract, which is mutually agreed upon between the nurses and management. There is nothing about approval. Last time I told my manager I was going to use a union day via text, they responded, “Can I say no? LOL.” Regarding union days. It reads:\n\n“2.07 Union Business\\*\\*:\\*\\* The Local Union President shall be granted twenty-six (26) days with pay to conduct Union business which do not accrue from year to year. The President shall have the right to designate other union representatives to receive such days in his/her place. The Union will notify the hospital of the names of the Union officers/reps.”\n\n11) “So now you basically dont understand what an emergency situation is and you have no respect for the authority either. Look I dislike corporate politics as much as the next person, but you never go over someones helmet. People like that cannot be trusted. It sucks, but its true.”\n\nI’m a nurse in the emergency department. I understand an emergency. It’s what I do. The respect for authority stops when authority is putting the people I represent at potential risk. You may not like it, but as a local union president, I have authority too. I also have an obligation to the union members.",
