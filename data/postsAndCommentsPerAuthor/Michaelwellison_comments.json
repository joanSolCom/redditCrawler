At the time, she was the smartest, most impressive person I could find and I wanted to learn everything I could from her. One of the big reasons we started that non-profit is because I wanted to learn how I could be as confident as she was. \n\nWhen I started the first nonprofit, I met Earl Phalen who graduated top of his class at Harvard Law and founded a national nonprofit, the Bell Foundation. I didn't interact with him that much but every interaction was profoundly influential. He showed me that there was a way to run a nonprofit with a business mindset to poise it for scale, impact, and system change. He also showed me what's it's like to really commit, work hard, and how to think of my time in terms of high leverage and low leverage activities.\n\nI didn't want to live the same life as the people that inspire me. I've always thought of it as carving out my own path and seeing if I can take the best qualities from people who inspire me.\n\n**Why do I want to give back?**\n\nI feel very lucky to be where I am and I want to make sure I do everything I can to pay it forward to make sure young people from similar backgrounds reach their full potential. It gives me immeasurable joy to see young people working hard and achieving their dreams. If I can help a little to enable someone to go further, faster, I'm excited to do it.\n\nI also think about the world I want to live in by 2050. I want to see the pace of technical innovation accelerate. I want to live in a world with less income inequality. I want a more intelligent and informed citizenry. Focusing on making the education system better makes my life and my community and my country and the world better over the long term.\n\nThe greatest outcome of this work has been the feeling of genuinely improving the world and improving people's lives. A lot of people pursue wealth without impact and can feel empty after they've reached their goal. I can't remember the last time I felt I didn't have a purpose for my life and something I was striving for.",

Obviously, the answer is complicated, but I think it begins by changing what we ask of educators.\n\nRight now, we’re asking CS faculty to handle the general responsibilities of being professors—pedagogy, curriculum design, research—while also preparing students to enter an industry that changes significantly every year. Then, throw a severe faculty shortage, growing class sizes, and pressure from administration and industry to grow CS capacity on there. A professor who finished school years or decades ago cannot be expected to publish research, teach courses, and also keep up with iOS development, which did not even exist as a specialty until 13 years ago.\n\nI think the vast majority of professors have the capacity to both teach the programming skills students need and to adopt strong pedagogical techniques, but they need better support. All professors who run CodePath’s courses, for example, get a detailed curriculum, video lectures, grading, projects, etc., which gives them time to focus on building student relationships and engaging their class. We’re also super explicit about our pedagogical theory and essential steps to student engagement — and a lot of professors just never get this training, they spend years learning their discipline but are never taught how to teach.  \n\nWe think this model can be scaled across many different disciplines. When professors have access to quality curricula and instructional support in areas outside their expertise, they can focus on teaching the subjects they know well. This model also expands professor capacity, which can help reduce class sizes. \n\nAnd industry for sure bears responsibility here. They’re facing a severe talent shortage; they cannot afford to deplete the CS faculty supply even further. They should be focused on lending their expertise to curriculum development, incentivizing their employees to help teach + mentor aspiring engineers, and funding ed opportunities. \n\nWe also believe that certain engineering practices are best learned in the context of an internship, which is why we are so aggressive about getting students their first every technical work experience and convincing employers to create more pre-junior year internship programs.",

The idea is that we are providing an early internship (often the first internship) for students who can then earn an offer at the end of the summer to Facebook's junior year internship program.

I'm supportive of this as an inclusive strategy for running a training program. \n\nIf you think about it, it's a bit ridiculous to expect a student who discovered programming in college, comes from a disadvantaged background, and attends a low ranked C.S. program to be able to compete with MIT students coding since they were 10 years old. Their resume would also never get looked at. A lot of the disparity in experience often comes from disparities in income and privilege which I believe we should not penalize students for. Let's instead create more pathways to proficiency and excellence. A diversity program done right will fill in the gaps like confidence, skills, work experience, and more prior to the competitive internship or entry-level opportunity.

There are a lot of motivations behind why people want to start startups but I encourage you to start with a problem that you want to solve, ideally one that you have a lot of knowledge about. Startups are really hard and not likely to succeed, so if you are trying to solve a problem you're really passionate about you increase your chances of learning fast and persisting to make something valuable. For me, it's all about finding ways to level the playing field for people from similar backgrounds. I also get excited about big ideas that have the potential to change the way millions work and live. My first company was a nonprofit where I went into low income communities and just started asking low income high school students how I could help them. Not wanting that nonprofit to die led me to think about scale, growth, raising money, and all the rest. It all started with a passionate desire to make an impact. Your why might be different but the idea is the same. Don't just focus on making money. Focus on finding a problem you want to solve so badly, you can't sleep at night. If your goal is not the money, as is my case, you never have to worry about losing your motivation. My focus is impact and changing the world, not just getting a big payday.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you just have to dive in and get started. There are a lot of motivations behind why people want to start startups but I encourage you to start with a problem that you want to solve, ideally one that you have a lot of knowledge about. Startups are really hard and not likely to succeed, so if you are trying to solve a problem you&amp;#39;re really passionate about you increase your chances of learning fast and persisting to make something valuable. For me, it&amp;#39;s all about finding ways to level the playing field for people from similar backgrounds. I also get excited about big ideas that have the potential to change the way millions work and live. My first company was a nonprofit where I went into low income communities and just started asking low income high school students how I could help them. Not wanting that nonprofit to die led me to think about scale, growth, raising money, and all the rest. It all started with a passionate desire to make an impact. Your why might be different but the idea is the same. Don&amp;#39;t just focus on making money. Focus on finding a problem you want to solve so badly, you can&amp;#39;t sleep at night. If your goal is not the money, as is my case, you never have to worry about losing your motivation. My focus is impact and changing the world, not just getting a big payday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
