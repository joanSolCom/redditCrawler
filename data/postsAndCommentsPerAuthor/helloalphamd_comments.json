The main differences we have noticed between in person vs online diagnosis is the amount of time a patient has to respond and the level of comprehensiveness of their initial diagnosis. Patients completing medical consultations online have the flexibility to respond to questions about their medical health at their convenience. Oftentimes these questions are very personal and may require additional introspection.\n2. The common factor is a marked increase in the number of people seeking care for anxiety and depression. According to a[ study in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770146), depression symptom prevalence was more than 3-fold higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. The[ CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20symptoms%20of,versus%206.5%25)%20(2).) reported that the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety disorder in April-June 2020 was approximately three times those reported in the second quarter of 2019.\n3. All of our client's data is securely encrypted both when it is sent over the network and when it is stored in our database. Our database and servers are hosted by Aptible, who specialize in HIPAA compliant servers which allow us to limit access to all client data.\n4. As our platform is asynchronous, our patients do not request or schedule appointments in the traditional sense. Anyone can begin a medical consultation at any time and it is assigned to an Alpha Provider for review once it has been completed. The response window for these consultations varies depending on the urgency of the condition. We currently only serve patients in the 35 states in the USA but are continuing to expand our services.\n5. Yes! We have a few free screening tools to help those seeking treatment for mental health get a sense for the severity of their symptoms. We have an anxiety screening tool ([https://www.helloalpha.com/anxiety-screening-intro/](https://www.helloalpha.com/anxiety-screening-intro/)), a depression screening tool ([https://www.helloalpha.com/depression-screening-intro/](https://www.helloalpha.com/depression-screening-intro/)) and a postpartum depression screening tool ([https://www.helloalpha.com/postpartum-depression-screening-intro](https://www.helloalpha.com/postpartum-depression-screening-intro)).\n6. We are currently working on expanding our partnership opportunities, and one of our primary goals is to work towards removing stigmas around mental health. We have partnered with[ *Withdrawals*](http://www.jorjahudsonportfolio.com/withdrawals.html), a short independent comedy film that aims to open up a discourse about mental health, neurodiversity, medication, and lack thereof. ⁠Director Jorda Hudson states: \"The comedic dialogue and situational humor allows for a safe space to explore a topic that is still considered taboo in much of our society. We believe that creating a safe and open discourse about antidepressants will help lift some of the burden that comes with the difficult decision of inviting these drugs into our brains. And in doing so, lessen the isolation that comes with mental illness, stigmas, meds, and lack thereof.\"⁠That being said, if you do have any suggestions for partnership or volunteer opportunities, we would love to hear about them!

        "body": "&gt;Do you find it more challenging to diagnose and/or treat mental health online/over the phone? Sometimes being in the physical presence of someone else can relax people and help them open up, is this something that is hindered by technology?\n\nGreat question! To begin with, Alpha Medical is an asynchronous telemedicine platform which means that we do not communicate with patients in real time, but through our HIPAA encrypted patient messaging platform. Through our recent patient feedback, we've identified that many of our patients prefer asynchronous conversations since they eliminate much of the anxiety that patients experience when seeing a clinician in a traditional setting. Our clinical team is strategically selected to demonstrate the best quality of care and empathy that a patient would expect to receive. The initial diagnosis that we ask patients to complete is comprehensive and allows for patients to respond when they feel most comfortable (i.e. you may start your online consultation, and complete it at your convenience), versus having limited time to answer personal questions in a waiting room. My clinical team and I do not find it more challenging to diagnose or treat mental health online, however, it is definitely more challenging to diagnose and treat certain mental health conditions such as bipolarity disorder and schizophrenia. In-person care care may be better suited for patients with bipolarity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia.",

Sometimes being in the physical presence of someone else can relax people and help them open up, is this something that is hindered by technology?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great question! To begin with, Alpha Medical is an asynchronous telemedicine platform which means that we do not communicate with patients in real time, but through our HIPAA encrypted patient messaging platform. Through our recent patient feedback, we&amp;#39;ve identified that many of our patients prefer asynchronous conversations since they eliminate much of the anxiety that patients experience when seeing a clinician in a traditional setting. Our clinical team is strategically selected to demonstrate the best quality of care and empathy that a patient would expect to receive. The initial diagnosis that we ask patients to complete is comprehensive and allows for patients to respond when they feel most comfortable (i.e. you may start your online consultation, and complete it at your convenience), versus having limited time to answer personal questions in a waiting room. My clinical team and I do not find it more challenging to diagnose or treat mental health online, however, it is definitely more challenging to diagnose and treat certain mental health conditions such as bipolarity disorder and schizophrenia. In-person care care may be better suited for patients with bipolarity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
