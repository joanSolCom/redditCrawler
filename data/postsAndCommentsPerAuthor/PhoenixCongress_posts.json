Our 160-page legislative proposal will end poverty, end mass incarceration, and end the endless wars. It's been offered to candidates from both parties in all the 471 federal races.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\nIn the 21st century, we have the ability to crowd-source functional government by collaborating across the internet. Inspired by Cesar Chavez, the Phoenix Congress is unionizing the electorate into a block of swing voters, the [American Union](https://phoenixcongress2020.com/about-us](https://phoenixcongress2020.com/about-us)). As the swing votes candidates need to win, we can demand legislative concessions from candidates in exchange for our support. These are written down in a ready-to-pass legislative package, the Blueprint for a Better America.

One country, one plan for moving us forward.

This lifts every single American up above the poverty line. In addition, it includes a public option for health insurance and 18 weeks paid maternal leave. \n\n[Ending mass incarceration]([https://phoenixcongress2020.com/end-mass-incarceration](https://phoenixcongress2020.com/end-mass-incarceration)) includes massive policing and prison reforms, including: no more military surplus for local police, a ban on no-knock warrants, ending civil asset forfeiture, cash bail reform, and a national police misconduct registry. The prison reforms include: reinstatement of federal parole and Pell grant eligibility, repeal of federal mandatory minimums and an end to the federal war on drugs.\n\n[Ending the endless wars](https://phoenixcongress2020.com/end-the-endless-wars(https://phoenixcongress2020.com/end-the-endless-wars)) includes repealing the 2001/2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force, ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in their war on Yemen, reducing the military budget and nuclear stockpile, and a prohibition on buying landmines or other lethal autonomous weapons. \n\n[Guns and abortions](https://phoenixcongress2020.com/guns-and-abortion(https://phoenixcongress2020.com/guns-and-abortion)) are wedge issues that the two parties have used to drive Americans apart. The Blueprint has a reasonable compromise; no bans on either. However, the legislation does include universal background checks, and codifies the Hyde Amendment. To protect this truce, any override of these provisions will require a 2/3rds super-majority in Congress for the next 10 years. \n\nNo one likes everything in this proposal; to accept it will require sacrifice. Inspired by Gandhi, Americans (especially candidates) can demonstrate a willingness to give something up by participating in a national 24-hour fast, (no food, water only) on Thursday, October 15. This is a fast of moral pressure. Based on candidate participation, the Phoenix Congress will generate a list of endorsements. \n\nYou can learn more on [our website](https://phoenixcongress2020.com/(https://phoenixcongress2020.com/)) or join the American Union [here](https://actionnetwork.org/ticketed\\_events/october-15th-fast-for-peace/(https://actionnetwork.org/ticketed_events/october-15th-fast-for-peace/)). \n\nCan we challenge the two party system in 2020?
