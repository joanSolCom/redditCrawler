Our End Family Fire program (endfamilyfire.org) is just one part of that work. We also fight to pass gun safety legislation. Right now, we’re fighting tooth and nail to pass a federal assault weapons ban through the House. A bipartisan bill by Rep. Cicilline is just 5 cosponsors short of moving forward. (You can take action here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.bradyunited.org/act/tell-congress-ban-assault-weapons.\"&gt;https://www.bradyunited.org/act/tell-congress-ban-assault-weapons.&lt;/a&gt;) Brady led the led fight for the original federal assault weapons ban. I was enacted in 1994, but it expired after 10 years because of pressure from the gun lobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
