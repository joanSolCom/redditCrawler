I like to imagine Lorne saying, \"Sooooo, we're not going to bring the door back for another season...\"\n\nYeah, Lorne would come down from time to time to talk to Jimmy in private for a moment but mainly just to hear the monologue and shoot the shit. And with a couple exceptions, it was more in a supportive role - just laughing at stuff and saying, \"Very nice\" in his Lorne voice after a joke he liked. Always very supportive and even after it ended - looked into a couple ways to bring me back into the family, which I appreciated. But I genuinely don't know what it's like now.",

But then Jimmy shot me a nervous &amp;quot;ha ha - but seriously, you gotta get outta here&amp;quot; look and I got out. I like to imagine Lorne saying, &amp;quot;Sooooo, we&amp;#39;re not going to bring the door back for another season...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Lorne would come down from time to time to talk to Jimmy in private for a moment but mainly just to hear the monologue and shoot the shit. And with a couple exceptions, it was more in a supportive role - just laughing at stuff and saying, &amp;quot;Very nice&amp;quot; in his Lorne voice after a joke he liked. Always very supportive and even after it ended - looked into a couple ways to bring me back into the family, which I appreciated.

Truth.\n\nAs a monologue writer, I wasn't in pitch meetings, and the last time I was before that policy changed, I never witnessed what you're talking about. The opposite. Usually amped and full of energy/ready to listen. *Everyone there* (except for me, because I don't drink) would usually have a beer or two during the meeting if it was after work that day. Those meetings were usually pretty fun.\n\nNo, he was not drunk during tapings/interviews when I was there. I know this because I was right there on the floor 15 feet away from him at the producers' table and with him right up until he want backstage.\n\nIn general, he could be difficult with the staff, yes. Particularly in the summer of 2017, he and I had a couple pretty rough days. By fall/winter, smooth sailing. Then about three weeks into Amy being back, rough days again.\n\nThe only departures I can speak to are writers, and that was any combination of burnout, frustration over ideas being rejected, the office morale as a whole, other opportunities, but most notably - Amy. An *insane* amount of turnover happened when she was Head Writer and it didn't make things better.

So that happens a lot, too. People get edged out, and it's ironically usually people who don't see it coming because they're doing the work.\n\nSo again, as someone who purposely avoided the whole drinking aspect of he show entirely (as I don't drink and *suspect* I'd be a pretty mean drunk), that's seriously all I *know.* And as someone who doesn't even drink, there are days where I can come across as hungover based on lack of sleep, depression or even just having a bad dream.

So, I talked with the show runner at the time, Gerard Bradford, about taking some time away to write from home while they “dealt with Amy” (it wasn’t working out at the time). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...the return date kept getting pushed back and pushed back...and the monos seemed better “without” me, because Jimmy didn’t know I was writing from home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I finally get the call that I’ll be working remotely indefinitely, go in to grab some things from my office…..and it was all gone. They’d already moved someone else into my desk. So, it was like, how do you ever go back after that? At least that was my thought at the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually did a podcast where I talked about it: &lt;a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/last-exit-to-brooklyn-w-tom-mccaffrey/e/76420032\"&gt;https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/last-exit-to-brooklyn-w-tom-mccaffrey/e/76420032&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Haven’t seen or talked to Jimmy since, sadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Give them a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for WWE...I think it’s just a tough time for them. The pandemic has been a disaster - how do you know who’s over when there’s no crowd reaction? And there have been a few storylines that were really, really rough. Rusev and Lana, Jeff Hardy’s DUI stuff, Retribution getting over….then getting steamrolled (during the Antifa conspiracy theory). Those are setbacks. And it’s tough to have those in a business where *everything* is working against you and it’s already super tough to catch lightning in a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
