She found me after reading about my work investigating the 1964 Klan murders of African Americans Charles Moore and Henry Dee in Mississippi. She'd never heard of or listened to SKS before, but since she believed Donnie was murdered in Mississippi, she thought I might be of some assistance. Donnie disappeared while on a road trip he took with a friend across the U.S. in May 1995. Debra had already investigated the case herself to some extent and had even obtained part of the police file.\n\nSo, Season 6 of SKS — back after about a two-year production period — is really the story of a mother, Debra, looking for answers, who will do anything to get those answers in the case of her missing son.\n\nAll of the victim’s family members I have worked with over the years suffer incredible guilt about the disappearance or murder of their loved one. Many are self-destructive with a guilt that consumes them. 'Why wasn’t I there to fight for them? Why did I do this or didn’t I do that? Somehow I must be responsible for their disappearance or for their murder.' And my task as the host of SKS is to kind of be a conduit for their journey into a sort of reconciliation with themselves. Less true crime, more self healing I like to say.\n\nAnd this new case, Season 6, is no different. About a year before Donnie went missing, he came out as gay to Debra. She didn’t react well to that and they had a fight. Even though they made up fairly quickly, she’s always felt that that fight distanced Donnie from her, and helped make him more vulnerable. These are the partial truth propagandas we tell ourselves, and it’s a big part of what I try to help victims unpack.\n\nFind out more about SKS and listen to the podcast here: https://www.cbc.ca/sks\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/dridgen/status/1270074812296241152",

I did find the focus on Climate Change particularly inspiring, though. All those people marching in Montreal a few weeks back! \n\nIn addition to this AMA (my first ever!), I'm simultaneously hosting a panel of smart, opinionated people on CBC's election night special. (It's streaming live pretty much everywhere, so you can't miss it.) Here's how to watch: www.cbc.ca/1.5325977\n\nThrough me, you'll also be able to ask THEM anything too. The panel includes:\n\t•\tCalgary mayor Naheed Nenshi\n\t•\tComedian and writer Ryan McMahon\n\t•\tHigh profile lawyer Marie Henein and\n\t•\tSun News editor in chief Mark Towhey \nThis is not your average political panel. These guys are not shy to say exactly what they think. They're a lot of fun, too. \n\nJust a warning: This is all a bit of en experiment! So, seeing as this AMA is happening at the very same time as my first ever live special please be patient while I get to as many Qs as possible. There might be delays of 5-8 minutes while we're live on TV, but we've got all night (or several hours at least!) so hang in there!\n\nIt's also super important to be an informed voter, so here are some tools to help you vote: cbc.ca/1.5270413\n\nPROOF\nhttps://twitter.com/jayme_poisson/status/1185684563739189250?s=21",

        "selftext": "Sharmini Anandavel’s disappearance was one of my first big cases as a new reporter on the Toronto Star’s crime beat. Fifteen-year-old Sharmini had immigrated from Sri Lanka and lived with her parents and two brothers in North York. On a Saturday morning in June 1999, weeks before her junior high graduation, she left her family’s apartment for what she said was the first day at a new job. She never returned.\n\nFour months later, her remains were discovered in a shallow grave in the East Don Parklands. No one was ever charged for her murder, but there was a suspect, and I spoke to him repeatedly in the months following her disappearance. His name is Stanley Tippett.\n\nTwenty years later, the case is still often on my mind, which is why I’ve revisited the case with the CBC. I looked at Tippett’s patterns since Sharmini’s murder as well as police theories that have been revealed for the first time.\n\nMore on Uncover: Sharmini here : https://www.cbc.ca/radio/uncover\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/shephardm/status/1176210030275825664",

Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives called it a desperate attempt to distract from the controversy that has engulfed the government for weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh took his seat in the House of Commons this week, after his February byelection victory. All parties are now preparing for their final push before October’s election.\n\nAdd into the mix an election in Alberta - something that will also have implications at the federal level.\n\nI have covered multiple federal and provincial elections and have also reported from all over the world in places like Rio de Janeiro, Iraq, South Korea and Japan. I’ve also reported on breaking news across Canada, including the fire in Slave Lake, floods in Manitoba and the shooting on Parliament Hill.\n\nIn my downtime, I also love to bake, read, avoid exercise and spend time with family, friends and my PVR :-) \n\nEDIT at 11 AM ET : Thanks everyone for the great questions, I am off for now. Don’t forget to watch Power ＆ Politics weeknights at 5 PM on CBC News Network. \n\nProof: https://twitter.com/VassyKapelos/status/1108445328104148993",

Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives called it a desperate attempt to distract from the controversy that has engulfed the government for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh took his seat in the House of Commons this week, after his February byelection victory. All parties are now preparing for their final push before October’s election.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add into the mix an election in Alberta - something that will also have implications at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have covered multiple federal and provincial elections and have also reported from all over the world in places like Rio de Janeiro, Iraq, South Korea and Japan. I’ve also reported on breaking news across Canada, including the fire in Slave Lake, floods in Manitoba and the shooting on Parliament Hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my downtime, I also love to bake, read, avoid exercise and spend time with family, friends and my PVR :-) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT at 11 AM ET : Thanks everyone for the great questions, I am off for now. Don’t forget to watch Power ＆ Politics weeknights at 5 PM on CBC News Network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof: &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/VassyKapelos/status/1108445328104148993\"&gt;https://twitter.com/VassyKapelos/status/1108445328104148993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
