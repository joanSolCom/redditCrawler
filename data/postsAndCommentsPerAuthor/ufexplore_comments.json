We (the scientific and medical communities) do not know how long it takes for your body to develop antibodies to the coronavirus after exposure. We also do not know long long any inferred immunity will last once you do develop antibodies. We also are not sure how effective an immune response will be, so even if you do have immunity, it might not be 100%.  There are lots of researchers working on answering these questions, but that science is happening right alongside this novel (aka brand new) virus, so it will take some time. \n\nTo compare to the flu, we need to get an annual flu shot to make sure that we have the antibodies necessary to keep us safe from this year's flu strains. In order to make a flu shot, scientists look at the \"worst\" strains from this year and predict (with amazing accuracy) what next year's influenza threat is going to look like. The vaccine is developed to provide protection again a combination of those predicted strains. Sometimes, the flu virus evolves in an unexpected way, and the flu shot that was developed is not as effective. You still have antibodies that recognize the virus, but do not infer much protection.

We (the scientific and medical communities) do not know how long it takes for your body to develop antibodies to the coronavirus after exposure. We also do not know long long any inferred immunity will last once you do develop antibodies. We also are not sure how effective an immune response will be, so even if you do have immunity, it might not be 100%.  There are lots of researchers working on answering these questions, but that science is happening right alongside this novel (aka brand new) virus, so it will take some time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To compare to the flu, we need to get an annual flu shot to make sure that we have the antibodies necessary to keep us safe from this year&amp;#39;s flu strains. In order to make a flu shot, scientists look at the &amp;quot;worst&amp;quot; strains from this year and predict (with amazing accuracy) what next year&amp;#39;s influenza threat is going to look like. The vaccine is developed to provide protection again a combination of those predicted strains. Sometimes, the flu virus evolves in an unexpected way, and the flu shot that was developed is not as effective. You still have antibodies that recognize the virus, but do not infer much protection. This is a similar story to dengue if you&amp;#39;re interested in more examples!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You can start with a simple SIR model and build it up to fit your needs - which is what I do when I start modeling a new disease because it helps to understand the basic dynamics of the system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nina Fefferman from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville gave a great webinar about applied math in real-time pandemic response. It was recorded and is very approachable if you wanted to watch it: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ewuo_2pzNNw\"&gt;https://youtu.be/Ewuo_2pzNNw&lt;/a&gt;.

The rod had hundreds of sensors that  linked to an ipad and constantly adjusted the water temperature and pressure as it brewed based on the readings. It was okay.. but not worth the money. Luckily I didn&amp;#39;t have to pay, it was part of a demonstration event.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For daily coffee I usually use drip or French Press depending on the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Specialty coffee is coffee that is graded at 80 points or higher by a trained quality grader. That being said I think that as coffeehouses look for new ways to increase foot traffic they will try any number of things to get new customers.

        "body": "Great question!   \nSo for the uninitiated third wave is a style of coffeehouse that puts a larger focus on the beverage and less on comfortable space. In Gainesville Volta falls in this category, Bandit in St Pete is another example. There is usually an aversion to batch brew coffee and orders are normally placed by the coffee's origin and made individually at time of order. This hyper clean spaces with $5 per cup coffee (not always, but usually)   \nI think that the third wave movement has been interesting for the coffee industry because it has done a lot to elevate coffee from commodity to an experience. It has helped push quality and brewing methods. It has also made coffee closer to wine than soda in the eyes of  connoisseurs. That being said, it has also opened the industry up to a lot of ridicule from outsiders and infighting within the industry. Economically it has been a mixed bag as coffee buyers  splurge large amounts of cash on certain farms because of this idea of distinction, but may only buy one season which creates wealth disparity and inequality among producers.   \nI think that the third wave has a place in the industry, and do enjoy a nice expertly prepared cup of coffee, but when those same people use to to shame, or ridicule novices or customers then it is going against the purpose of coffee as a beverage that builds community and encourages discussion.   \nIn my opinion, drink what you like, as you like it... as long as everyone in the supply chain (farmers to baristas) are paid a living wage. I've had $100 cups of coffee and $2 cups of coffee that have been equally good.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great question!&lt;br/&gt;\nSo for the uninitiated third wave is a style of coffeehouse that puts a larger focus on the beverage and less on comfortable space. In Gainesville Volta falls in this category, Bandit in St Pete is another example. There is usually an aversion to batch brew coffee and orders are normally placed by the coffee&amp;#39;s origin and made individually at time of order. This hyper clean spaces with $5 per cup coffee (not always, but usually)&lt;br/&gt;\nI think that the third wave movement has been interesting for the coffee industry because it has done a lot to elevate coffee from commodity to an experience. It has helped push quality and brewing methods. It has also made coffee closer to wine than soda in the eyes of  connoisseurs. That being said, it has also opened the industry up to a lot of ridicule from outsiders and infighting within the industry. Economically it has been a mixed bag as coffee buyers  splurge large amounts of cash on certain farms because of this idea of distinction, but may only buy one season which creates wealth disparity and inequality among producers.&lt;br/&gt;\nI think that the third wave has a place in the industry, and do enjoy a nice expertly prepared cup of coffee, but when those same people use to to shame, or ridicule novices or customers then it is going against the purpose of coffee as a beverage that builds community and encourages discussion.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn my opinion, drink what you like, as you like it... as long as everyone in the supply chain (farmers to baristas) are paid a living wage. I&amp;#39;ve had $100 cups of coffee and $2 cups of coffee that have been equally good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In the past the biggest breakdowns usually come from the producer side of the chain. So farmer to middleman, to market, to exporter. It really depends on the country, as each nation has its own exporting procedures. So Kenya is more complex than say Peru for moving coffee from the farm to the export harbor.   \nIn a way Starbucks ability to shift its sourcing helps it to a degree from some of these issues, however most importers have large supply networks that are shifting to accommodate various issues.   \nCoffee is a seasonal crop.. so every few months importers have to change where they source as harvests become available.",

Coffee will pass through 20-25 different sets of hands before it gets to your cup.  In the past the biggest breakdowns usually come from the producer side of the chain. So farmer to middleman, to market, to exporter. It really depends on the country, as each nation has its own exporting procedures. So Kenya is more complex than say Peru for moving coffee from the farm to the export harbor.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn a way Starbucks ability to shift its sourcing helps it to a degree from some of these issues, however most importers have large supply networks that are shifting to accommodate various issues.&lt;br/&gt;\nCoffee is a seasonal crop.. so every few months importers have to change where they source as harvests become available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We (the scientific and medical communities) do not know how long it takes for your body to develop antibodies to the coronavirus after exposure.

We also are not sure how effective an immune response will be, so even if you do have immunity, it might not be 100%.  There are lots of researchers working on answering these questions, but that science is happening right alongside this novel (aka brand new) virus, so it will take some time. \n\nTo compare to the flu, we need to get an annual flu shot to make sure that we have the antibodies necessary to keep us safe from this year's flu strains. In order to make a flu shot, scientists look at the \"worst\" strains from this year and predict (with amazing accuracy) what next year's influenza threat is going to look like. The vaccine is developed to provide protection again a combination of those predicted strains. Sometimes, the flu virus evolves in an unexpected way, and the flu shot that was developed is not as effective. You still have antibodies that recognize the virus, but do not infer much protection.

For instance, I've been less bored during the pandemic - because I have more to do, and it's challenging in just the right way, and so there's plenty of challenge and meaning to fill my day. Those of us that feel right now are lucky. \n\nBut others aren't. Many people are laid off and stuck at home, maybe without the money or financial resources to game or buy books (the first thing I did when I got the work-from-home order from the university was order about a dozen books since the public library was closed). Many of us can't work from home, or don't have classes to occupy us, and don't have access to the activities that brought meaning and challenge to our lives. For instance, if choir or chamber orchestra is your passion, those are closed off now. Depending on where you live, hiking or the outdoors may no longer be an option. \n\nOthers who rely on social interaction at work or by going out are now trapped at home alone, and lonely - and bored, because they don't have social interaction to turn to. \n\nIn short: it's really variable, and depends a lot on who you are as a person, the situation you're in, and the resources (social, financial, etc) that you have to cope with your new reality. Some of us lucked out in all those regards (I'm one of them, and it sounds like you are too), but many folks didn't. It's okay for them to be bored; but we can also talk about ways to help cope with it.",

For instance, I&amp;#39;ve been less bored during the pandemic - because I have more to do, and it&amp;#39;s challenging in just the right way, and so there&amp;#39;s plenty of challenge and meaning to fill my day. Those of us that feel right now are lucky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But others aren&amp;#39;t. Many people are laid off and stuck at home, maybe without the money or financial resources to game or buy books (the first thing I did when I got the work-from-home order from the university was order about a dozen books since the public library was closed). Many of us can&amp;#39;t work from home, or don&amp;#39;t have classes to occupy us, and don&amp;#39;t have access to the activities that brought meaning and challenge to our lives. For instance, if choir or chamber orchestra is your passion, those are closed off now. Depending on where you live, hiking or the outdoors may no longer be an option. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others who rely on social interaction at work or by going out are now trapped at home alone, and lonely - and bored, because they don&amp;#39;t have social interaction to turn to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short: it&amp;#39;s really variable, and depends a lot on who you are as a person, the situation you&amp;#39;re in, and the resources (social, financial, etc) that you have to cope with your new reality. Some of us lucked out in all those regards (I&amp;#39;m one of them, and it sounds like you are too), but many folks didn&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s okay for them to be bored; but we can also talk about ways to help cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We don&amp;#39;t talk as much about that, but I think it&amp;#39;s natural to feel that curiosity about a once-in-a-lifetime event (hopefully), even if it&amp;#39;s a really negative thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re collecting data at our website, and would love if you (or friends and family) &lt;a href=\"https://www.erinwestgate.com/participate.html\"&gt;would like to participate&lt;/a&gt; on our research about how people are feeling right now during the outbreak, and how that&amp;#39;s affecting our behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

What we know from the science of emotion is that ANY of us can feel bored in the right circumstances. If what we're doing doesn't feel meaningful, or we're not able to pay attention, we feel bored as a result. For instance, in one study [more than 90%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178116301524?via%3Dihub) of people shocked themselves when forced to watch a boring video for over an hour. \n\nSome of us are lucky enough to have the freedom and resources to adapt quickly to even very brief feelings of boredom, and find ways to re-engage meaning and challenge in our life. Those of us with that freedom are lucky, and we're less likely to experience boredom. But many folks aren't. Boredom [is more common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775405) among people \"stuck\" in situations - students in school, for instance, or those of us stuck in boring jobs because we need to pay the bills. It's not people's fault in those cases; it's the fault of the bad situations they're trapped in. Sure you can quit your boring factory job - but what if you have family relying on you to work that job to put food on the table and keep the lights on? Or what if you need to suffer through that boring class to graduate?",

Have you heard of the distinction [between hedgehogs and foxes?](https://www.blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk/crag/files/2016/06/the_hedgehog_and_the_fox-berlin.pdf) It's a play on how modern scholars break down along the two lines from a fable by Greek poet Archilochus, who wrote, \"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\"\n\nWhen it comes to research, I'm definitely a fox. I'm interested in many many things, and one of those is the rapidly shifting society we're in and how attitudes (like LGBTQ+ bias) have changed even in my own lifetime.

One thing we know about emotions (boredom included) is that they're always about our interpretation (in psychology we call them \"construals\") of the current situation.

If you're familiar with the concept of [flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-ebook/dp/B00GO8HZIW), it's quite similar: the overly-simplified version is that we have X amount of resources at any given moment that we can invest in an activity. Say 10 resources. \n\nIf Netflix takes 3 resources, that's going to be too easy. You'll feel bored.\n\nIf playing an instrument takes 15 resources, that's too hard. You'll feel bored. (And frustrated. And maybe anxious, too, depending).\n\nThe trick is to scale your activities to where you're currently at (like Goldilocks!), and that's what I love about your question. There's two ways to do that: one is to change ourselves. We can increase resources short-term by doing things like drinking caffeine (my students will tell you I'm addicted to Sugarfree Rockstar) or getting more sleep, and those short-term situational changes have real impact. But we can also increase them long-term by getting better at our tough hobbies. \n\nI recently picked up violin again after almost 15 years of not playing, and it is much harder and much more boring than it was when I stopped playing, because I'm so bad at it now. As I get better at it, a lot of that will become automatic again, and it will get easier. As that happens, I'll both have more fun playing and also feel more \"up\" to playing even when I'm a bit tired (bc playing isn't as demanding). The same goes for reading and other high-skill hobbies; they get easier as we get better at them, and we get better at them by doing them. (Which can be hard initially when we're not good enough for them to be fun yet). \n\nThe other thing we can do is not to change ourselves, but change the situation. Keeping with the violin example: it's much harder to practice a Vivaldi solo than it is to practice some simple Christmas tunes. If I'm tired and not feeling up to playing, I can increase my odds of enjoying it by modifying my activity to make it easier. In education we often call this \"scaffolding\": when introducing a new activity to learners, we give them an easier modified version of the task to help them learn the ropes, then as they get better, we scale it up. Video games use the same logic: they get harder as you go. \n\nBut we can also use that in reverse, and make things easier for us when we need it. And if that helps us stick with it, it (in theory) builds up those long-term skills that will make even the harder more challenging versions easier for us (and a better fit) down the road.",

We know that attention is an important component of boredom: we feel bored when we can't pay attention (either bc what we're doing is too hard or too easy). But most of that work has looked at cognitive attention (or in some cases visual attention) more broadly. \n\nWe do know for instance, that people like to [snack more](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00369/full) when bored. I love these studies, but if you randomly assign people to a boredom induction, and then put snacks down in front of them, bored people eat more. \n\nWhether that's about taste is hard to say. We also find in other studies that if you experimentally make some people bored, they're more likely to give themselves [electric shocks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178116301524?via%3Dihub) as well. \n\nSo it might not be specific to our senses - but to the extent that sensory experiences are easy to immerse ourselves in and pay full attention, it's entirely possible that they may reduce boredom. For instance, the fad of [dining in the dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_dining) that was going around a couple years ago, where you go to a restaurant and the entire room is dark. The idea is you essentially have visual sensory deprivation, which should help you focus more intently on what you are tasting and have a more intense culinary experience.

But before we can understand that, we have to understand what boredom is. A lot of my work has looked at the basic science of [boredom as an emotion](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XV7TKMWZWZXIXZMBHFV9/full) \\- how it works and why we experience it. \n\nMy current sense is that boredom isn't good or bad - but it does signal a need for change. Whether that's changing our engagement with the current task (to make it more meaningful or a better cognitive \"fit\"), or doing something else already, depends on the options we have.\n\nKnowing that gives us some hints about why people get bored, and how we can prevent it. It also lets us predict what people will do when they're bored that they might not otherwise. \n\nI'm a basic scientist, so applied research isn't really my area - but I have wonderful colleagues in education and industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology, who I hope can put this basic understanding of boredom to good use to make people's live, well...a little less boring.",

But before we can understand that, we have to understand what boredom is. A lot of my work has looked at the basic science of &lt;a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XV7TKMWZWZXIXZMBHFV9/full\"&gt;boredom as an emotion&lt;/a&gt; - how it works and why we experience it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current sense is that boredom isn&amp;#39;t good or bad - but it does signal a need for change. Whether that&amp;#39;s changing our engagement with the current task (to make it more meaningful or a better cognitive &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot;), or doing something else already, depends on the options we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing that gives us some hints about why people get bored, and how we can prevent it. It also lets us predict what people will do when they&amp;#39;re bored that they might not otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a basic scientist, so applied research isn&amp;#39;t really my area - but I have wonderful colleagues in education and industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology, who I hope can put this basic understanding of boredom to good use to make people&amp;#39;s live, well...a little less boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And, if you have the chance to talk with someone for &amp;quot;coffee exchange&amp;quot; that also works very well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

When there is no gravity, plant roots need another way to know how to navigate. We found in our research that when plants have directional light they can use that as a cue of which way to grow. So, when there is no gravity, roots will grow away from a light source. If there is no light and no gravity, plants still know how to grow away from where they are planted, even without any cues. You can think of it as \"instinct\" in that there are inherent features of how cells grow that direct roots to spiral away from where they're planted. This way plants will not use up all the resources in one little spot. Yes, water can also be a cue, and it too has a greater effect on root directions when you take gravity out of the equation!",

In choosing which opportunities to pursue at this stage, it may help to spend some time thinking about your specific career objectives and the job characteristics that are important to you (e.g. academic, government, private, nonprofit positions; balance of time teaching, conducting research, in the office, in the field; etc.). This can make it easier to say no to opportunities that aren’t a good fit for you and identify opportunities that will move you towards your career objective.\n\nRight now, we are both studying green turtle foraging ecology (in-water work), but before starting our PhDs, we worked on nesting beaches. Nerine has worked with green, leatherback, and hawksbill turtles in Costa Rica and loggerheads in Cabo Verde, in addition to some in-water experience with greens and hawksbills in Puerto Rico. Alex has worked with Kemp’s ridleys in Texas and green and hawksbill turtles in St. Croix, in addition to in-water work with greens in Australia. We have a hard time picking favorites, but we would love to see an olive ridley arribada -- lucky you!\n\nUnfortunately, we have both seen nesting turtles with carapace injuries/missing limbs, which is especially sad to see when there are signs of the injury being the result of entanglement or boat strike, rather than predation. It is also quite inspiring when they manage to nest successfully and return to the sea in spite of their injury!\n\nHappy to answer your questions, and we both wish you the best!",

Sea turtles consistently return to the same beach (or relatively the same area) every time they nest, so some populations will have to relocate to new beaches if their old ones disappear. Sea level rise may also impact sea turtle foraging habitats such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, oyster reefs, etc.\n\nFor more on the topic, check out the following: http://www.wwfca.org/?19554/Sea-turtles-threatened-by-rising-seas",

The primary impact sea level rise is currently having on sea turtles is via the erosion of nesting beaches. Sea turtles consistently return to the same beach (or relatively the same area) every time they nest, so some populations will have to relocate to new beaches if their old ones disappear. Sea level rise may also impact sea turtle foraging habitats such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, oyster reefs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more on the topic, check out the following: &lt;a href=\"http://www.wwfca.org/?19554/Sea-turtles-threatened-by-rising-seas\"&gt;http://www.wwfca.org/?19554/Sea-turtles-threatened-by-rising-seas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The sea turtle life cycle is absolutely fascinating to me -- not only biologically, but also the challenges it poses to conservation. The first time I worked with sea turtles was on a nesting beach in St. Croix, USVI -- while on the project, I just couldn't stop asking questions and knew this was an area I wanted to study. Sea turtles are this iconic organism that truly captivate and connect people from all over the world with the ocean, and that is unbelievably cool.\n\nNerine: Sea turtles face many threats from humans, they are important to coastal communities around the world, and there are still many fascinating research questions to answer about them. I had early experiences with sea turtles, which captivated me from the start (my parents had me in the ocean from an early age, and my mother’s family is from Grenada, in the Caribbean, where you can see sea turtles on the beach and in the water). In high school, I volunteered on a leatherback nesting beach in Costa Rica, and I was hooked!",

The sea turtle life cycle is absolutely fascinating to me -- not only biologically, but also the challenges it poses to conservation. The first time I worked with sea turtles was on a nesting beach in St. Croix, USVI -- while on the project, I just couldn&amp;#39;t stop asking questions and knew this was an area I wanted to study. Sea turtles are this iconic organism that truly captivate and connect people from all over the world with the ocean, and that is unbelievably cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nerine: Sea turtles face many threats from humans, they are important to coastal communities around the world, and there are still many fascinating research questions to answer about them. I had early experiences with sea turtles, which captivated me from the start (my parents had me in the ocean from an early age, and my mother’s family is from Grenada, in the Caribbean, where you can see sea turtles on the beach and in the water). In high school, I volunteered on a leatherback nesting beach in Costa Rica, and I was hooked!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For example, questions that seagrass ecologists may ask can relate to: how the seagrass functions and provides a foundation for the ecosystem, how it supports organisms by providing food and / or habitat, and the ecosystem services meadows provide our society (e.g. carbon burial as a climate change mitigation strategy, buffering coastlines from storms, etc.).\n\nWe are finding that seagrass structural (e.g. how tall it is, how dense, etc.) and nutrient characteristics can all affect how green turtles utilize meadows! This is an active area of research -- stay tuned!\n\nWhat turtles feed on often varies with geographic location. For example, green turtles feed primarily on seagrasses in the Caribbean, but mostly algae in the Pacific.",

For example, questions that seagrass ecologists may ask can relate to: how the seagrass functions and provides a foundation for the ecosystem, how it supports organisms by providing food and / or habitat, and the ecosystem services meadows provide our society (e.g. carbon burial as a climate change mitigation strategy, buffering coastlines from storms, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are finding that seagrass structural (e.g. how tall it is, how dense, etc.) and nutrient characteristics can all affect how green turtles utilize meadows! This is an active area of research -- stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What turtles feed on often varies with geographic location. For example, green turtles feed primarily on seagrasses in the Caribbean, but mostly algae in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Thanks for the question. This is often a topic of concern for beekeepers. I do believe that pesticides contribute to bee losses every year. Thus, they are not entirely innocuous. However, I do believe that other stressors impact colonies more (*Varroa*, nutrition, queen issues, etc.).\n\nYes, there is documented evidence of pesticide accumulation in beeswax. We are starting to investigate this topic (we just completed a study a few months ago on this). In general, though, just because something is there doesn't mean it is a problem.

Thus, they are not entirely innocuous. However, I do believe that other stressors impact colonies more (&lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt;, nutrition, queen issues, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is documented evidence of pesticide accumulation in beeswax. We are starting to investigate this topic (we just completed a study a few months ago on this). In general, though, just because something is there doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is a problem. Many of the pesticides that accumulate in wax are lipophilic (wax loving). So, the question that needs to be asked is if these compounds would leave an environment &amp;quot;they love&amp;quot; and move into bee food or the bees themselves.
