It basically seems to think any PLMN other than the ones it knows *must* be Verizon, forces Verizon/LRA APNs on you, and completely ignores any changes you attempt to make.

It makes me sad, because there could be a much better, more open architecture there (as there really was before Google and the OEMs started really breaking things to appease the carriers).\n\nAll that to say, I haven't tried a new Ting SIM in any of our OnePlusses, but I imagine it could be challenging if they're interpreting them as T-Mo postpaid or Verizon.

We were told a week beforehand that Sprint was no longer providing devices to any other third-party distributors and that we’d have to start using Brightstar as of August 1.\n\nUnfortunately, Brightstar was still months away from being ready to take on that business. They couldn’t drop ship devices, which was a requirement for most MVNOs. They weren’t ready yet to do postpaid inventory (where an MVNO didn’t pay Sprint or a distributor for the device until it shipped to the customer), which was the only way most MVNOs could afford to do flagship devices at that point. They hadn’t even finished the APIs to allow MVNOs to place orders, check status, etc. and integrate with their existing ecommerce sites, billing systems, etc. Even setting up accounts and credit terms wasn’t expected to be possible for weeks if not months they said. Nothing was ready.\n\nNobody at Brightstar was willing to tell their bosses at SoftBank or Sprint any of that. And nobody at Sprint knew how to stop the train that was already in motion. We placed one last order before August 1 for a bunch of devices to get us through the next few months and walked away.\n\nThankfully, it was right as the transition from a much more closed device ecosystem for Sprint was beginning to be forced open by Apple and Motorola. We shifted to doing everything we could to source devices from elsewhere that were super SKU/open market (i.e. not Sprint-specific, but still compatible with Sprint).\n\nWe also shifted from using a Sprint MVNO-focused distributor for fulfillment to setting up our own warehouse in Starkville, Mississippi (where our parent company, Tucows, had an office and team through the acquisition of a small ISP billing software company in the 2000s). We had already been testing shipping SIMs and one or two models of phones from there for about six months at that point, and the botched Brightstar migration forced us to start doing everything ourselves. We ended up outgrowing the space we were in three or four times over the next two or three years there and having to move/expand.\n\nMost folks at Brightstar weren’t happy with the SoftBank acquisition, because they lost their business with all the other carriers (which was much larger than the Sprint business “replacing” it). And it was pretty disruptive, at least for us Sprint MVNOs.\n\nI don’t think we ever bought anything in any significant quantities from Brightstar. I’m not sure if they captured really any of the pre-August 1 “transition” business in the end. But it did eventually wipe out the few distributors that had focused on the Sprint MVNO market up to that point. I think Aerovoice only made it a month or two beyond August 1.

Most of these things were at least a little bit frustrating for customers (most of whom think we should just trust that they are who they say they are — to which we say of course we trust you, but we have to verify you still), but they were necessary.\n\nFor a very long time, I would have (reasonably, imho) argued that Ting was the safest place to have or park your number. A few other carriers have come close or caught up, but most of the big guys are still painfully bad at account, SIM, and number/porting security.\n\nWe have very recently changed to require port-out approval from the line being ported. If a customer doesn’t reply (approving or denying), for whatever reason, we have a process to still require Mobi-account specific knowledge, broader notification from us, and a waiting period.\n\nWe’re working on 2FA now for the new self-care portal, and building one-time password generation and confirmation into both care interactions (for any changes other than payments) and ports out.  While the current legacy self-care portal doesn’t support 2FA, porting and SIM changes cannot be be conducted there. (That’s no excuse — but it is an awful system about to be EOL, and I would rather use those resources hardening the new system and portal.)\n\nI don’t view any of this as perfect. Account, SIM, and number/porting security are all incredibly important to us, and we will constantly work to improve on those fronts — I don’t think we’ll ever be done. And I think feedback from places where we have informed customers is vitally important. I’m completely willing the explain the necessity of all of this to the customers who are pissed as to why we didn’t give them their port out information without them being able to complete any existing verification or approval steps (and I do).\n\n(And believe me, I think an authenticated customer should have zero barriers to their port our information. I’ve fought hard, more than a few times in my carrier, to not making porting out harder than it has to be. But it does have to be secure.)",

It makes me sad, because there could be a much better, more open architecture there (as there really was before Google and the OEMs started really breaking things to appease the carriers).\n\nAll that to say, I haven't tried a new Ting SIM in any of our OnePlusses, but I imagine it could be challenging if they're interpreting them as T-Mo postpaid or Verizon.

We were told a week beforehand that Sprint was no longer providing devices to any other third-party distributors and that we’d have to start using Brightstar as of August 1.\n\nUnfortunately, Brightstar was still months away from being ready to take on that business. They couldn’t drop ship devices, which was a requirement for most MVNOs. They weren’t ready yet to do postpaid inventory (where an MVNO didn’t pay Sprint or a distributor for the device until it shipped to the customer), which was the only way most MVNOs could afford to do flagship devices at that point. They hadn’t even finished the APIs to allow MVNOs to place orders, check status, etc. and integrate with their existing ecommerce sites, billing systems, etc. Even setting up accounts and credit terms wasn’t expected to be possible for weeks if not months they said. Nothing was ready.\n\nNobody at Brightstar was willing to tell their bosses at SoftBank or Sprint any of that. And nobody at Sprint knew how to stop the train that was already in motion. We placed one last order before August 1 for a bunch of devices to get us through the next few months and walked away.\n\nThankfully, it was right as the transition from a much more closed device ecosystem for Sprint was beginning to be forced open by Apple and Motorola. We shifted to doing everything we could to source devices from elsewhere that were super SKU/open market (i.e. not Sprint-specific, but still compatible with Sprint).\n\nWe also shifted from using a Sprint MVNO-focused distributor for fulfillment to setting up our own warehouse in Starkville, Mississippi (where our parent company, Tucows, had an office and team through the acquisition of a small ISP billing software company in the 2000s). We had already been testing shipping SIMs and one or two models of phones from there for about six months at that point, and the botched Brightstar migration forced us to start doing everything ourselves. We ended up outgrowing the space we were in three or four times over the next two or three years there and having to move/expand.\n\nMost folks at Brightstar weren’t happy with the SoftBank acquisition, because they lost their business with all the other carriers (which was much larger than the Sprint business “replacing” it). And it was pretty disruptive, at least for us Sprint MVNOs.\n\nI don’t think we ever bought anything in any significant quantities from Brightstar. I’m not sure if they captured really any of the pre-August 1 “transition” business in the end. But it did eventually wipe out the few distributors that had focused on the Sprint MVNO market up to that point. I think Aerovoice only made it a month or two beyond August 1.

It was a surcharge that we (like other telecoms) have added for years (reassessed annually) to account for the various mandatory-but-not-tax things telecom providers have to pay to NPAC, USAC, etc. I have never been a fan of the concept in general (and have written here about my disdain for the concept often). It should be gone before your next bill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just completed a traffic analysis and reassessment of the plan bundling, which made a big difference in taxes in some jurisdictions that were heavy on voice service taxes. That would be the only thing that I could think of that would cause that big a of jump in a single city/county (unless you maybe used a different billing or service address originally).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

When we switch to the new billing platform, we'll be what is sometimes called postpaid-in-advance — you pay upfront for the base plan and in arrears for extras and overages.\n\nI'm not here to question what other companies do, but I can certainly say the ramifications for us of fucking with telecom taxes are much higher than they would be for a foreign company.  There are virtually no jurisdictions in this country where a 0.5% ***total*** telecom tax would be meeting the letter or the spirit of the law on a line that can make or receive even a single phone call or send or receive even a single text.\n\nData-only lines were taxed in some or all jurisdictions in six states — Hawaiʻi, New Mexico, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin until just a few weeks ago.  Four others (New Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington state) ended their taxation on Internet-only access earlier.  The grandfather provision in the ITFA that allowed those taxes finally expired on July 1.\n\nMost major urban jurisdictions (and many states) tax hard amounts per line for things like E911 — often times $1 or more a line.  There is absolutely no way around that as a telecom provider that wouldn't subject you to significant (and, in my opinion, unacceptable) risk.\n\nWhile unbundling a plan and doing a thorough interstate traffic analysis can potentially allow you to make sure the amount your customer are having to pay in telecom taxes is accurate (and we are going through that process now), you will never see the taxes for a smartphone line on Mobi be anywhere like what you're seeing over there.",

There are virtually no jurisdictions in this country where a 0.5% &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; telecom tax would be meeting the letter or the spirit of the law on a line that can make or receive even a single phone call or send or receive even a single text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data-only lines were taxed in some or all jurisdictions in six states — Hawaiʻi, New Mexico, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin until just a few weeks ago.  Four others (New Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington state) ended their taxation on Internet-only access earlier.  The grandfather provision in the ITFA that allowed those taxes finally expired on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most major urban jurisdictions (and many states) tax hard amounts per line for things like E911 — often times $1 or more a line.  There is absolutely no way around that as a telecom provider that wouldn&amp;#39;t subject you to significant (and, in my opinion, unacceptable) risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While unbundling a plan and doing a thorough interstate traffic analysis can potentially allow you to make sure the amount your customer are having to pay in telecom taxes is accurate (and we are going through that process now), you will never see the taxes for a smartphone line on Mobi be anywhere like what you&amp;#39;re seeing over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We're still pretty small, but we're beginning to figure out ways to use the scale we do have to do some interesting things (like shift customer onboarding completely to apps for customers that prefer to go that route, break eSIM out of the silly strictures that have been placed on it by most other carriers here in the U.S., do customer care better, do affordable without gimmicks, etc.).

You see it show up in funny ways — Automatic, before SiriusXM killed it, went with Telefónica, even though it was never available outside the U.S. and roamed on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.

(And forgive me for any typos I haven't caught and edited yet, it's just a little shy of 5am here and my coffee hasn't fully kicked-in yet!)\n\nOfficially, our unemployment rate here in Hawaiʻi was 13.9% as of June (down from 34% in April), although new numbers for July should come out this week.  Looking around to our family and friends, that number would seem to be missing a lot of folks.  Stories of [entire families being laid off](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/10/hawaii-coronavirus-travel-restrictions-trigger-record-unemployment/3093887001/) are heartbreaking, and the state has been [inexcusably slow](https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/05/how-an-antiquated-it-system-failed-thousands-of-hawaiis-unemployed/) to figure things out to get help to the people that need it (although I know that has been true in at least some other states, as well).\n\nWe were thankfully able to keep everybody on the team working.  We closed our stores and offices back in March when the first stay at home restrictions were imposed, and all of our retail team shifted to working from home to help out with customer care.  And although there has been a new surge in cases here on Oʻahu over the past few weeks, everyone on the team has been safe.\n\nWe've continued to forgive or extend bill due dates for customers that need help.  (The official \"Keep Americans Connected\" pledge was pretty poorly implemented by other carriers based on what we've heard or seen, sadly, and expired June 30.  We've not disconnected anyone since March for non-payment.)\n\nSo, yes, we're lucky to have not been impacted the same way as folks in the hospitality and tourism sectors have been.  But the economy is so interconnected, we see that pain in our friends and family, and in our customers and their families.\n\nWe've long been worried about the economy's dependence on tourism here, and as a company we've worked to promote entrepreneurship (particularly in other fields).  I hope, once we begin to see some non-oncoming-train light at the end of this tunnel, that we can really begin to rethink that as a state.  Of course, we'll always warmly welcome visitors that love Hawaiʻi, but we've got to figure out some other ways of creating opportunities for folks, too.",

I believe they used pieces of Sprint’s WMI to bolt-together T-Mo, Sprint, USCC, 3, and GV through IMS.\n\nBut the IMSI, IMS/core, and RAN are all T-Mo’s (with some Google glue for when you’re roaming), so it’s mostly not their own core.\n\n(Their multi-IMSI SIMs use their own ICCID with a German prefix iirc.

They plan to eventually decommission around \\~25k Sprint towers iirc.  As that happens, nearby T-Mo towers will take over utilizing Sprint's spectrum and most likely broadcasting Sprint's legacy PLMNs (at least for a long time).\n\nOf the \\~30k (rough guess) Sprint towers that they'll be keeping, I expect they'll begin to broadcast T-Mo's PLMN in the not-too-distant future once the merger closes.

(Metro was once a standalone MNO.  Virgin and Boost were once standalone MVNOs — Virgin on Sprint and Boost on Nextel.)\n\nSIMPLE, Straight Talk, and Net10 are all MVNOs of Tracfone, which is owned by América Móvil.  Combined, Tracfone is the largest MVNO, by far, in the United States.  They can negotiate much more aggressively with Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile than most other standalone MVNOs, even Google.\n\nMost MVNOs, though, offering big buckets of data with a set price are depending on breakage.  i.e. You're committing to pay, say $50 for 25GB but you really only use 7GB (rough average across all subscribers).  Some MVNOs will also show you the door if you consistently use the full amount of your data allotment since you're hurting their margin on breakage.\n\nFi isn't really setup to benefit from breakage at all.  They're sort of the opposite — they cap your data costs at $60 even if you use way more than 6GB.  Someone who uses just 1GB would pay just for that 1GB.  In fact, Fi even charges you to the nearest 0.01GB — really no breakage at all.\n\nI've always believed Fi was more about being able to test technology, processes, ideas, and to perhaps nudge the bigger carriers a little bit in more customer-friendly directions.  Apple used iPad and Watch to push eSIM.  Google used Fi.\n\nIt is also possible that Fi's cost is really $10 per GB with Sprint, T-Mo, and USCC.  That was a very common price for wholesale data back when Fi launched.  It wouldn't surprise me terribly if the big carriers have been unwilling to negotiate lower pricing for Google given the size of Google's pockets.  And once upon a time, Google might have subsidized Fi more heavily, but now that every penny counts towards EPS they've shifted far away from doing that in multiple areas (i.e. Google Fiber).",

Most of them are still at Tucows (Ting's parent company), in fact.  I loved the work I got to do, and came to care a lot for the people I had the chance to work with every day.\n\nI got to work on moving our fulfillment centre for SIMs and phones from an outsourced company in Los Angeles to our own team in Starkville, Mississippi (where Tucows had a small office from an acquisition about a decade beforehand).\n\nI got to work on launching Ting Internet, our fiber service, in its first two towns — including being there for our first customer install in Westminster, Maryland.  (Our network folks didn't have DHCP working until about thirty minutes before we lit the fiber for that customer, so it was both nerve-racking and exciting at the same time.)\n\nAnd lots of things on the mobile side.  Being the first CDMA MVNO to support the Nexus 5, launching Apple, Affirm, our iOS app years ago, launching with T-Mo...\n\nTucows and Ting are pretty lean, so you're never more than one degree of separation away from pretty much any project — which makes for a lot of opportunities to help out, gain experience, and in some ways build your own role.\n\nNot everything is perfect, of course.  Tucows was probably just under 200 or so employees when I started, and is over 600 probably now.  There were some real growing pains there.  It still felt like a startup when I started — even if it was a 20 year-old startup at that point.  By the time I left, there was some bureaucratic and silo creep that made things a little tougher to get done as quickly/easily as what once was possible.  Some of that was probably necessary, but some of it I think wasn't to be honest.\n\nOn the whole, for me, it was an amazing place to learn, to get to do great work, and to work as a team to push our industry forward at least a little bit.  At its best, it is one of those relatively rare companies that do their best to hire smart people and then trust them to do great work — giving them the tools and latitude to bend the rules a little bit where necessary to get things done.\n\nI hope you get a chance to experience it, if it feels like it might be for you, and there's a role that's a fit.",

And almost always, they're right.  :)  I can understand why you're genuinely upset, though, but I think some of that frustration isn't helping you get your message across here (there are mostly Ting customers, not Ting employees here). But I ***do*** think you've raised an important issue.\n\nTons of automated decisions like this (i.e. how quickly to suspend after payment failure, how to handle highly unusual usage patterns, how to treat unexpectedly large Ting shop orders, etc.) have to be made by Ting's systems.  The decision to devote dev time to add logic like customer longevity, payment history, etc. into those processes is a tough one because most of those issues generally impact a very small number of customers on any given day.  But, as you've now seen firsthand, that can be a very significant, localized impact nonetheless.\n\nThe really abrupt (and, in my opinion, un-Ting-like) payment failure email you saw was an oft-debated (as the agent mentioned to you) reflection of the risk that Ting takes in being a postpaid carrier with no credit check.  (I hated it, but I didn't \"own\" the right to change it — or else I probably would have done so in the middle of the night at one point or another.)  When I worked for Ting, we spent a lot of time and effort in trying to balance that risk with our default instinct of wanting to generally trust folks.  But building that trust into our systems in a smart way was a never-ending project (as it should be).\n\nIt's not the apology you were looking for — I no longer work for Tucows — but I'm sorry I didn't work to make this part of our system better while I was there.  I designed the payment extension mechanism and process that was mentioned to you (but that unfortunately wasn't applied) and shepherded that through our dev process because I believed it would make a real difference in some of our customer's lives in times when they needed it most.  But if I had more time, I would have worked to have us build smarter logic into the suspension/hotlining process — there's really no reason a customer of six years should only have three days, over a weekend no less, to update their payment method in any circumstance.

They still weren't truly unlimited, but I think each tier had a higher cap and maybe a higher throttled speed.  That may still even be the case, but their website is a disaster.\n\nYou're right about Fi — the geek in me really likes their approach.  I'm still not sure it is as easy an explanation as it probably needs to be to *truly* go from \"Project\" Fi ot Fi for Everyone.\n\nI think I've seen you mention it here, but Ting did start out with a republic/Fi (and now even USCC with their \"New Unlimited with Payback\") mechanism where you potentially get a refund if you use less than you signed up for originally.  Maybe Ting's implementation of it wasn't perfect, but it led to an ungodly number of customer interactions every month.  The idea is intriguing to people, but when it comes down to it I'm not sure it makes a huge difference for most people.\n\nI can't help but wonder if Fi has it *mostly* right, model-wise.  $20 for unlimited talk and text plus $10 per GB at data is fairly self-explanatory.  The problem, of course, is that their domestic pricing basically hasn't changed since they launched.  Either they're terrible negotiators, T-Mo/Sprint/USCC/3 have given them zero slack, or they're actually intending to make margin on Fi.  It's hard to believe they couldn't at least breakeven at half that — and it's surprising to me that they're not willing to operate Fi at a pretty significant loss just to learn from it for now.\n\nBut I do think that could be the right model.  If someone were doing unlimited talk and text and a \"starter\" amount of data for $10 to $15 per month, with data at $5 per GB or so with some sort of throttled \"unlimited\" data/bill protection option for kids/grandparents/etc. then I think they could help free a decent number of folks from the oligopoly.",

It&amp;#39;s hard to believe they couldn&amp;#39;t at least breakeven at half that — and it&amp;#39;s surprising to me that they&amp;#39;re not willing to operate Fi at a pretty significant loss just to learn from it for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do think that could be the right model.  If someone were doing unlimited talk and text and a &amp;quot;starter&amp;quot; amount of data for $10 to $15 per month, with data at $5 per GB or so with some sort of throttled &amp;quot;unlimited&amp;quot; data/bill protection option for kids/grandparents/etc. then I think they could help free a decent number of folks from the oligopoly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "As has already been mentioned, it was necessary (and is temporary).  A tiny bit more detail...\n\nIn Sprint’s systems, your number is assigned to a given market (known as a CSA deeper down).  For example, if you had a 212 number, your CSA would be NYCNYC212.  Cincinnati is OHICIN513.  (There’s some hierarchy there, as you can better see from the Cincinnati example: OHI/CIN/513.  The first three letters are the larger region, the second three the city or part of the region.  The final three are the area code.  CSAs with multiple area codes usually look pretty similar — NYCNYC646 and NYCNYC212.)\n\nFor a bunch of reasons, a number can only be transferred in over top of a temporary number that’s issued in the same CSA.  Hence why your number was temporarily changed.  The agent you spoke with probably should have warned you (unless maybe that step has been automated now and they don’t even realize it, but I doubt it).\n\nThis limitation can sometimes be an especially major pain in the butt.  For example, if you’re porting in a 212 number, it isn’t possible to get a temporary NYCNYC212 number.  So any port-in of a 212 number requires a special backoffice to work the port, and it isn’t easy to reach that backoffice (nor do most reps even realize it exists).\n\nBecause you’re technically porting in a landline (VoIP counts as landline) number, your port will take a bit longer than a wireless-to-wireless port.

A tiny bit more detail...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Sprint’s systems, your number is assigned to a given market (known as a CSA deeper down).  For example, if you had a 212 number, your CSA would be NYCNYC212.  Cincinnati is OHICIN513.  (There’s some hierarchy there, as you can better see from the Cincinnati example: OHI/CIN/513.  The first three letters are the larger region, the second three the city or part of the region.  The final three are the area code.  CSAs with multiple area codes usually look pretty similar — NYCNYC646 and NYCNYC212.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a bunch of reasons, a number can only be transferred in over top of a temporary number that’s issued in the same CSA.  Hence why your number was temporarily changed.  The agent you spoke with probably should have warned you (unless maybe that step has been automated now and they don’t even realize it, but I doubt it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This limitation can sometimes be an especially major pain in the butt.  For example, if you’re porting in a 212 number, it isn’t possible to get a temporary NYCNYC212 number.  So any port-in of a 212 number requires a special backoffice to work the port, and it isn’t easy to reach that backoffice (nor do most reps even realize it exists).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you’re technically porting in a landline (VoIP counts as landline) number, your port will take a bit longer than a wireless-to-wireless port.  But with any luck, you should have your NumberBarn number active on Sprint maybe as soon as tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the unnecessary worry in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Sometimes it has been a few weeks or months later.  But once you have one, it will work on Ting. For iPhone 8, A1863/A1864 should work on either network. A1905/A1897 will likely be GSM only. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ting will carry A1863/A1864 in the shop. As &lt;a href=\"/u/LiterallyUnlimited\"&gt;/u/LiterallyUnlimited&lt;/a&gt; mentioned, we expect our preorder and shipping to match the big guys for the iPhone 8. As always, no need to buy it from us — Apple direct is an awesome buying experience. ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for iPhone X details as we get closer to its preorder and launch window.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I can't share the specifics of Sotaborn's account here, but I can speak generally about why posts *like* this come up sometimes...\n\nFor a while, during the early days of Ting, we didn't closely examine referral credits given and received.  We figured, good people would learn about Ting and give us a chance and share the details with their friends and family — who would then also hopefully learn about Ting and give us a chance, and so on...\n\nAnd that's true in the vast, *vast* majority of cases.  It's an awesome way for folks to be rewarded for spreading the word about Ting.  We genuinely appreciate that, and hope that folks see it as a win-win.\n\nBut we noticed a weird trend — at first, it was a small number of devices that moved from account to account, using referral credit but never actually becoming a \"paying customer.\"  Sometimes the same device would move through a dozen or more accounts in a single year!  (And, by the way, we have a few awesome folks who have referred **crazy** numbers of real customers and who also may *never* have to pay a Ting bill out of their own pocket as a result.  That's **not** a problem, and that's a completely different scenario, and we take no issue with someone who is just really great at sharing Ting.)\n\nThese folks were different, though.  Not only did they never pay a bill on their own accounts — but the accounts they referred would never pay a bill either, never had normal usage patterns on their single devices, and would eventually be terminated for non-payment once their credit ran out, since the prepaid card associate with them would only have $1 or $5 on it...  Weird, right?\n\nThis cycle would continue on, and on, and on.  Eventually we figured out the obvious — that johndoe1@gmail.com, johndoe2@gmail.com, johndoe3@gmail.com, johndoe4@gmail.com, and so forth and so on (often genuinely only different by a digit or two) were actually all the same person, using the same prepaid cards that they bought at the corner pharmacy, and the same small pool of devices (pre-GSM).  We've seen six accounts, a dozen accounts, or more — all that clearly belonged to the same person and that blatantly were just being thrown away once they had served as a referral sockpuppet for another account.\n\nWe work really hard to build a fair service.  But that doesn't work if *most* of our customers are having to subsidize completely free service for a small group of folks that are determined to figure out ways to take our referral program for a ride so that they **never** pay for service.\n\nIt's quite a small problem in the grand scheme of things, in terms of total dollars, and the number of accounts would make up a tiny fraction of a fraction of our total number of customers.  But we realized that not addressing it would ultimately allow it to grow, which could eventually threaten the entire referral program.  Thankfully, the parameters are pretty predictable and relatively easy for properly-programmed systems to catch, even as these folks have become more clever.  Even still, we have small team of folks that look at *every* instance identified to be absolutely certain that we're not missing anything or miscategorizing someone's actions.\n\nI wish the circumstances were different, because we really hate having to ever second guess the motives of one of our customers.  But we think the long-term health and survival of our referral program are too important to stick our heads in the sand, even if it does sometimes lead to difficult conversations with a small number of folks.",

Google then uses some of their magic to make sure calls and texts route in and out properly using your U.S. Fi number.\n\nDoing something like that requires either (or both) of a.) a lot of OS-level customization and/or b.) the very close cooperation of multiple MNOs.\n\nGoogle (and Apple with their eSIM for iPad) are about as close as anyone has gotten so far in getting the sort of technological openness required for something like this in the U.S.  TFW has been doing a bit using pass-through roaming, although they uniquely benefit from the América Móvil ecosystem.\n\nAll that being said, we're working on something currently on the CDMA international roaming front, and on both the CDMA and GSM fronts specifically for Canada and Mexico.  We should be able to share more on those projects a little later in May or early June if all goes as planned.",

Google then uses some of their magic to make sure calls and texts route in and out properly using your U.S. Fi number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing something like that requires either (or both) of a.) a lot of OS-level customization and/or b.) the very close cooperation of multiple MNOs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Google (and Apple with their eSIM for iPad) are about as close as anyone has gotten so far in getting the sort of technological openness required for something like this in the U.S.  TFW has been doing a bit using pass-through roaming, although they uniquely benefit from the América Móvil ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that being said, we&amp;#39;re working on something currently on the CDMA international roaming front, and on both the CDMA and GSM fronts specifically for Canada and Mexico.

        "body": "Hey milangdo,\n\nWe removed the ability to \"cancel\" a Ting account years ago — around the same time we added the consolidated port out information page in the cancellation section of your account dashboard.  Very few customers cancel in that way — almost everyone just ports their numbers out or, in even rarer cases just cancels the individual line(s).  Doing either or both of those things automatically cancels your Ting account, once your last line is gone.\n\nWe removed that button because the very small number of people who clicked it almost always didn't understand what they were doing.  They would click it, which would cancel their numbers (after several really big red warnings) — and then go to the carrier they wanted to switch to and try to port their numbers.  That would then kick off days of effort on all sides to get the numbers back, reactivate them, and then finally port them.  We tried redesigning it a bunch of times before just realizing it was mostly obsolete, except...\n\nOne small side benefit is that it gives folks that are thinking about leaving a gentle nudge to call us and tell us why they're leaving.  We've made many changes based precisely on that feedback...  Our support for Airave and Cel-Fi was based on folks saying they were leaving due to home indoor coverage, for example.\n\nThe one thing I can't just \"explain away\" is any time you spent on hold.  Thanksgiving to Christmas is the one time of year that we sometimes have hold times that defy our forecasts and projections.  And no matter how many extra folks we hire in advance, we still end up having some periods of wait time (almost always still less than a minute, but any hold time at all is bad).  I'm very sorry you had to deal with that.\n\nIf you really do just want all of your numbers expired, please feel free to shoot me an email (in my flair).  I'll go through the steps to verify that you're you and then take care of it for you.  If you'd rather do it yourself, you can also do that by clicking on each line under Device Settings and choosing the little pencil beside \"Active\" and then pick the deactivate option.  Once all your lines are deactivated, your account will cancel itself automatically within a day or two, once any last minute usage has come through.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for all the hassle.  If you'd be able/willing to share what originally made you decide to leave Ting, we genuinely do always want to work to address those challenges and constantly work to build a better service.\n\n-Justen (head of product for Ting)",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey milangdo,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We removed the ability to &amp;quot;cancel&amp;quot; a Ting account years ago — around the same time we added the consolidated port out information page in the cancellation section of your account dashboard.  Very few customers cancel in that way — almost everyone just ports their numbers out or, in even rarer cases just cancels the individual line(s).  Doing either or both of those things automatically cancels your Ting account, once your last line is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We removed that button because the very small number of people who clicked it almost always didn&amp;#39;t understand what they were doing.  They would click it, which would cancel their numbers (after several really big red warnings) — and then go to the carrier they wanted to switch to and try to port their numbers.  That would then kick off days of effort on all sides to get the numbers back, reactivate them, and then finally port them.  We tried redesigning it a bunch of times before just realizing it was mostly obsolete, except...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One small side benefit is that it gives folks that are thinking about leaving a gentle nudge to call us and tell us why they&amp;#39;re leaving.  We&amp;#39;ve made many changes based precisely on that feedback...  Our support for Airave and Cel-Fi was based on folks saying they were leaving due to home indoor coverage, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one thing I can&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;explain away&amp;quot; is any time you spent on hold.  Thanksgiving to Christmas is the one time of year that we sometimes have hold times that defy our forecasts and projections.  And no matter how many extra folks we hire in advance, we still end up having some periods of wait time (almost always still less than a minute, but any hold time at all is bad).  I&amp;#39;m very sorry you had to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you really do just want all of your numbers expired, please feel free to shoot me an email (in my flair).  I&amp;#39;ll go through the steps to verify that you&amp;#39;re you and then take care of it for you.  If you&amp;#39;d rather do it yourself, you can also do that by clicking on each line under Device Settings and choosing the little pencil beside &amp;quot;Active&amp;quot; and then pick the deactivate option.  Once all your lines are deactivated, your account will cancel itself automatically within a day or two, once any last minute usage has come through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m sorry for all the hassle.  If you&amp;#39;d be able/willing to share what originally made you decide to leave Ting, we genuinely do always want to work to address those challenges and constantly work to build a better service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Justen (head of product for Ting)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Normally only fraudulent activity with the associated MEID would set into motion this sort of response on the part of our systems and processes, which is incredibly rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can entirely understand that you&amp;#39;d be done with Ting after this experience, and I apologize you&amp;#39;ve had to go through this.  Every indication from your message makes me believe we made a mistake.  If you&amp;#39;d be willing to send me a private message here on reddit (or an email to &lt;a href=\"mailto:j@ting.com\"&gt;j@ting.com&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#39;d prefer) with one of your phone numbers or your email address...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) If you&amp;#39;re set on leaving, I completely understand.  I can work to make sure you have service in the meantime, and make sure your devices and phone numbers are ready to go when you port out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) If you&amp;#39;d be willing to stay, I can make sure your device is cleared and ensure its history before you purchased it never impacts your account again and try to make this right by you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In either case, I&amp;#39;d like to try to figure out what happened, where we went wrong, and make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again.  Again, I&amp;#39;m very sorry that this has taken up hours/days of your life.  It&amp;#39;s very rare that we take these actions, and we&amp;#39;ve always worked hard to make sure our accuracy rate is 100% because the implications of a false positive — as in your case — are just not fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The cost of roaming data is just too high, and the reporting isn't quite quick enough for us to make it available even at our cost — you could do *a lot* of damage very quickly at the domestic roaming data rate. \n\nCuriously, though, our GSM provider has added a fair bit of coverage in and around Buckhannon, Philippi, and Elkins very recently. And they haven't yet updated the coverage map, but just in the past few days (breaking news!), they were assigned numbering resources for Bluefield, which would seem to indicate coverage could be arriving there soon.\n\nSo, I couldn't recommend you switch to Ting today, but there's been more progress in the past six months than there had been in almost ten years, which feels promising.\n\n(Full disclosure: I grew up in West Virginia.)",

And they haven&amp;#39;t yet updated the coverage map, but just in the past few days (breaking news!), they were assigned numbering resources for Bluefield, which would seem to indicate coverage could be arriving there soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I couldn&amp;#39;t recommend you switch to Ting today, but there&amp;#39;s been more progress in the past six months than there had been in almost ten years, which feels promising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Full disclosure: I grew up in West Virginia.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The number indicates its sequence in Ting needing to offer it.  An A1 SIM would have been for the first mini SIM we would have sold, but no Sprint LTE devices ever used a mini SIM.  (Mini SIMs are sometimes mistakenly referred to as a \"full-size SIM.\"  But, technically the full credit card-size SIM — not broken out — is an actual full-size SIM.)\n\nThe B1 SIM (for the first micro SIM we ever stocked) became the first, and that was originally for the Nexus 5.  The C1 was the first nano SIM we needed to carry, originally for the iPhone 5.\n\nThere's a handy chart over [here](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428218-Finding-Your-SIM-Card) that maps out Ting's SIM designation to the Sprint part/SKU/UPC.\n\nWhen we added GSM service, we started at the other end of the alphabet (instead of, say D1—in case there are future, smaller SIM card sizes).  Z1 would have been for a mini SIM, Y1 would have been for a micro SIM, but since we did a nano SIM that had built-in adapters (i.e. a trio SIM), we went with X1.  **Which is a good opportunity to share [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulkJTzY0fKU) again, I believe.**  (I will always love that video.)\n\nIf there is eventually a pico SIM, it would probably be D1 for CDMA and W1 for GSM.  A femto SIM would be E1 for CDMA and V1 for GSM.  And so on.  There would be enough space for ten more sizes before Ting's SIM naming scheme would meet in the middle and reach a kind of Y2K-like issue (five more beyond yocto, so we'd also have to come up with new metric unit prefixes, or go back to ambiguous names like where \"mini\" came from).  At which point CDMA and GSM will both likely have already been replaced by LTE/VoLTE (and that would probably already have been replaced by something else, too).  And, probably, SIMs will be virtual by that point, anyway.\n\nSorry for geeking out.  :)",

You'd be able to port your number over to a GSM SIM each time you travel, but you'd want to do the port at least a few hours before your flight just in case anything goes awry.\n\nOne big catch is that you'd need a new GSM SIM each time you travel (since, for now at least, Ting's GSM carrier doesn't allow SIMs to be reused).  Your CDMA SIM would be fine to be reused when you get home, though.\n\nYou mentioned T-Mo's international roaming plan wouldn't work for you.  Are the countries you travel to on Sprint's \"included\" Global Roaming list?  It would mean leaving Ting for your line (and probably paying more for your domestic usage, since I imagine you're conscious of that having been with Ting for a while), but just something to consider...\n\nhttp://www.sprint.com/landings/international-value-roaming/",

Your CDMA SIM would be fine to be reused when you get home, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You mentioned T-Mo&amp;#39;s international roaming plan wouldn&amp;#39;t work for you.

I work with our in-house developer that codes and builds our mobile apps for both iOS and Android.\n\nThe report that **an** app called \"ting\" is on the list is accurate.  However, it's not our Ting app. This is a case of \"Ting\" being a pretty commonly-used name and word around the world.\n\nOur app has only ever been coded and compiled with official builds of Xcode directly from Apple.  The app that also happens to be called \"ting\" and that *is* impacted is available in the App Store in China.  (**Update:** Apple has since [removed](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/21/apple-removes-infected-apps-from-chinese-app-store/#continued) all impacted apps from the App Store, including the non-Ting Mobile app also called \"ting\".)\n\nAll that being said, just because it wasn't our app doesn't mean we're not continuing to be hypervigilant about security and privacy.  One recent development is that we're rolling out two-factor authentication to you to help you better protect your Ting dashboard.  And while I can't talk too much about our internal processes, we're adding and strengthening the layers and mechanisms of security and authentication inside Ting, as well.\n\nWe really do appreciate (and understand) the concern.  We're updating our advisors now with information on the XcodeGhost situation, so that they can both provide clear information on the distinction between the impacted Chinese \"ting\" app and our own non-impacted app, and to help any of our customers who may have installed WeChat or any of the other apps affected by the vulnerability.  Thanks for bearing with us while we investigated this (and I hope you can appreciate we wanted to be certain of the facts of the situation before responding).",

For example, if you port to or from republic wireless, we see their parent company, Bandwidth.com as the gaining or losing carrier.  Bandwidth also provides numbers for Google Voice, so we can't always tell the difference.\n\nAs best as I can tell, Project Fi numbers are actually ported *to* T-Mobile and then abstracted from there, which is a bit surprising to me.  I would have figured they would become Google Voice numbers (and, as a result, port to Bandwidth).  Since every Fi subscription also effectively gets an active Sprint line of service, you'll have some sort of an MSID/MDN pair there, although the latter may potentially be masked.\n\n(I'm with Ting.

For example, if you port to or from republic wireless, we see their parent company, Bandwidth.com as the gaining or losing carrier.  Bandwidth also provides numbers for Google Voice, so we can&amp;#39;t always tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best as I can tell, Project Fi numbers are actually ported &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; T-Mobile and then abstracted from there, which is a bit surprising to me.  I would have figured they would become Google Voice numbers (and, as a result, port to Bandwidth).  Since every Fi subscription also effectively gets an active Sprint line of service, you&amp;#39;ll have some sort of an MSID/MDN pair there, although the latter may potentially be masked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m with Ting.

The customer service might not be so great, but the price will be tough for any MVNO like us to beat.\n\nIf you have T-Mobile LTE coverage in your area, they have a $70 plan that includes 11GB.  Their [LTE hotspot](http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-4G-LTE-HotSpot-Z915-Prepaid) (no contract) is around $125.  You could reactivate that hotspot on Ting GSM for $6 per month (plus shared usage) once your data use goes back to normal.\n\nIf you don't have T-Mobile LTE coverage, a Verizon [prepaid Jetpack](http://www.verizonwireless.com/prepaid/prepaid-jetpack/) is $90 a month for 10GB (plus $50 upfront, no contract, for the hotspot itself).  I believe you can usually find them at Best Buy.\n\nIt doesn't quite match up with your current use case, but one other option to consider is [Karma](https://yourkarma.com/).  They're $99 for 10GB, but what you don't use does rollover (and never expires).  There's also no monthly fee.  Their new hotspot won't start shipping until August, and it might not be quite the best deal for your needs over the three month move, but they're a neat, scrappy startup like us so I thought I'd mention them anyway.  :)\n\nBest of luck with the move!",

You could reactivate that hotspot on Ting GSM for $6 per month (plus shared usage) once your data use goes back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have T-Mobile LTE coverage, a Verizon &lt;a href=\"http://www.verizonwireless.com/prepaid/prepaid-jetpack/\"&gt;prepaid Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; is $90 a month for 10GB (plus $50 upfront, no contract, for the hotspot itself).  I believe you can usually find them at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t quite match up with your current use case, but one other option to consider is &lt;a href=\"https://yourkarma.com/\"&gt;Karma&lt;/a&gt;.  They&amp;#39;re $99 for 10GB, but what you don&amp;#39;t use does rollover (and never expires).  There&amp;#39;s also no monthly fee.  Their new hotspot won&amp;#39;t start shipping until August, and it might not be quite the best deal for your needs over the three month move, but they&amp;#39;re a neat, scrappy startup like us so I thought I&amp;#39;d mention them anyway.  :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck with the move!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Folks who have GSM lines on Ting will be able to roam internationally. The rates aren&amp;#39;t great, but they are doable if you&amp;#39;re in a pinch. Still, unlock and get a local SIM or look into something like KnowRoaming. Your wallet or pocketbook will thank you.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
