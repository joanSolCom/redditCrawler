Their political system (which is really a kind of soft totalitarianism) is the best suited for such an aim, but it violates many human rights along the way and it anti-democratic.\n\nSaudi Arabia wants to consolidate its influence in the Muslim world and dominate the oil market—which it has already done, in a way, through OPEC and OPEC+.

There&amp;#39;s certainly a good reason why few politicians are independent today; ask me again in a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be happy if I raised just $2000 from this AMA, but it&amp;#39;s fine if I don&amp;#39;t get a cent. The official campaign fundraising goal is classified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By getting on the ballot, I&amp;#39;ve already qualified to compete on the ballot, and my campaign strategy was structured around the presumption that I wouldn&amp;#39;t raise much money. My opponent has literally 19 years&amp;#39; worth of name recognition and a 6 or 7-figure war chest, so it&amp;#39;s an uphill battle. It&amp;#39;s been Plan B from the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So many people fall back into drugs when they return to the same old places with the same old problems that rehab is just another failed chapter into their recovery.

Conventional compassionate approaches do not work on them, and you have to use some of their language to get them to even listen.  It's not unrealistic to reach out to everyone in society to get them to change their minds about addiction of all kinds, but it is not practical to expect them all to change.

All governmental programs should be thought of as cost-benefit analyses.  Not *only* in economic terms, but it must be part of the consideration.

        "body": "I entirely agree.  Police need to be educated better to empathize with addicts.  In their defense, being a police officer is an emotionally and mentally demanding job.  I believe we need to nurture a society where all people have a baseline trust for law enforcement, though, and I think it's worth trying my idea of needle exchanges at police stations.\n\nIt ain't gonna be easy.  In the first month, maybe you only get one addict who comes in to swap their needles, at a 1:1 ratio, for clean ones.  No names are given to the cops, no proof of residence, only needles.  But then that addict doesn't get arrested; in fact he gets a free service not provided anywhere else.  He goes back and tells some of his other friends who are users, who regard the whole thing as a suspicious attempt to lure addicts in to self-report.  Nevertheless, his friends give him their old needles to swap the next time he goes to the police station.\n\nNow he goes back to the police station and gets more clean needles.  It's obvious to the policemen exchanging his needles that he's trading in more than a one-person supply, but they treat it all the same. 1:1 for new needles.  And next to that police counter there's a depository for painkiller pills, no questions asked.  Next to that depository there's a little tower of literature about public health, motivational brochures, maybe even a help wanted section by trusting community members willing to employ someone in recovery.  And police get statistics about needles which may or may not be misleading; still, inferences can be drawn, and different towns can compare their results and methodologies to find the best system.\n\nNow that addict visiting the police station does this several times, and gets a reputation inside his circle for being \"that guy\" who gets clean needles.  Maybe people shun him for fear he's an informant, or maybe the police begin to develop a new kind of reputation of their own, as their practice spreads.  But every time someone, anyone, swaps a needle, they remove one health hazard off the street.  That reduces the risk of all kinds of communicable diseases, which is good for everyone.\n\nLet's say there's some addict who doesn't have a needle but needs to do some heroin.  Common sense may tell you that he just won't use, which is good.  But another common sense would tell you that he'll just smoke it, or snort it, since there are three ways to take heroin.  (The vast majority of heroin users, however, start with painkillers, which they may or may not have been prescribed.  These pills should be the target of the logistical response; the needle exchange is a kind of failsafe program for far-gone users.)  But say this addict wants to inject.  He could buy a syringe over the counter most places, but that might use money he doesn't have, or wants to spend on something else (namely drugs).\n\nMaybe that addict without a needle looks for a dirty old needle on the street and trades it for a clean one.  Or maybe now addicts who trust the program (or trade needles through their friend who trusts the police) decide to start picking up used needles on the street with the intention of giving/trading them with their friend who will exchange them for new ones.  The idea is also to create a kind of semi-black market that incentivizes addicts to clean up their neighborhoods of dirty needles on the street—health hazards to anyone jogging or walking past.  I don't know about y'all, I've seen old needles several times walking around my neighborhood, and it has me worried.  Even us non-users without friends or family who are addicts can be affected (my car was also \"broken into\" once by an addict; I accidentally left it unlocked).\n\nA fresh needle isn't really going to expire, so even if a police station has a 0% success rate, maybe the one in the next town over gets 40 needles a month.  They can learn more about their communities, or donate their fresh needles to a precinct where addicts trust the police more...or give them to a hospital.  Or even put them into patrol cars so police can, when they encounter dirty needles on the job, offer a 1:1 exchange in the field—although I believe very few police would want to take that initiative.  We must start repairing the trust somewhere, because lasting divisions and animosity help tear apart a community and a civilization.",

        "body": "Any comprehensive, lasting solution must address the problem at all levels: social, economic, cultural, geographical, logistical, and moral.  I ran unsuccessfully for Massachusetts Senate in 2016 with the opioid crisis as my major issue, and although I have no formal background in neuroscience or public policy, I have spoken to several experts from various fields (as well as addicts).\n\nWe have to ask *why* people are using opioids.  There are economic reasons, of course, but I believe the root cause is hopelessness and depression, and **the solution cannot be purely economic, although it must be partially.**  Feelings of disconnect, propelled by social media and contemporary culture, have created a sense of alienation across the United States (and in Canada, and elsewhere, but my analysis is geared towards the U.S.).  **People have lost their purpose,** and for diverse reasons, they feel like their world tomorrow is going to be worse than their world yesterday. To fix the economic aspect, corporations (with jobs that current and potential addicts could actually do and would actually want) must be lured back to the exurbs.  Tax breaks for fixing up decaying properties.\n\n**There must be a philosophical and psychological remedy** to rescue the addicted and to prevent others from slipping into addiction.  This must be more than the government can arrange, although our leaders can use their positions and reputations to help.  It must be a massive cultural response that removes *shame* and guilt from the addiction, and hostility from those who have never used.  Religious leaders, cultural icons, and police must begin to treat addicts with more compassion—even if they feel differently in private.\n\nFrom a public health standpoint, I believe more people need to be trained to administer narcan/naloxone, and it needs to be made more available, and cheaper.  **Methodone clinics must open, alongside needle exchanges.**  (I personally think needle exchanges should be located at guilt-free police stations, to repair the bonds of trust between addicts and law enforcement, and because I think many police should change their feelings toward addicts.)  And doctors need to stop overprescribing painkillers for simple things; limit the supply to 5-days for most things.  And outright ban carfentanyl.  **Legalize weed nationwide.  Consider decriminalizing or legalizing other illicit drugs,** based on non-partisan studies reviewed pragmatically by health professionals and unbiased Congresspeople.\n\nFrom a legal position, **the government has got to go after pharmaceutical companies,** and pursue them mercilessly.  **Transitioning away from our for-profit healthcare system is necessary** to stop the physical and financial abuse some of these corporations are inflicting upon Americans in search of higher profits.\n\nFrom a foreign policy and supply standpoint, we must recognize that **most of the painkiller pills come from China.**  It's like the Third Opium War, where China is getting revenge on the West. A diplomatic solution must be found.  **Most of the heroin comes from plants grown in Afghanistan,** the production of which increased more than 1000% since we invaded in 2001—also America's longest continuous war, ever.  What are we still doing there?  I hope these current negotiations with Afghanistan can work toward a solution, but I doubt they will.  Afghanistan is a shitshow and probably will be for the next 50 years; if it were more stable, you could develop the mining industry to give locals better jobs (this could be an opportunity for China to help).  If our planes are going to stay there anyway, I support using them to locate and/or burn poppy fields.  If our soldiers are going to be on the ground, they should help build roads and plant trees; it wouldn't be enough to reverse the ill will America's \"won\" over there, but it's something.\n\nMost of these proposals wouldn't really cost that much, as I see it.  (They *could*, but they don't have to.)  And what we'd save should be regarded as more important: working class Americans from all ages and backgrounds who are supposed to be treated with some degree of respect.  Most of these addicts are not productive members of society now, and a drain on our resources.  But the solution cannot be to let them wither and die.  It must be to invest time and resources wisely to help turn them into productive taxpayers and citizens with a renewed sense of gratitude and meaning towards their fellow Americans.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any comprehensive, lasting solution must address the problem at all levels: social, economic, cultural, geographical, logistical, and moral.  I ran unsuccessfully for Massachusetts Senate in 2016 with the opioid crisis as my major issue, and although I have no formal background in neuroscience or public policy, I have spoken to several experts from various fields (as well as addicts).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people are using opioids.  There are economic reasons, of course, but I believe the root cause is hopelessness and depression, and &lt;strong&gt;the solution cannot be purely economic, although it must be partially.&lt;/strong&gt;  Feelings of disconnect, propelled by social media and contemporary culture, have created a sense of alienation across the United States (and in Canada, and elsewhere, but my analysis is geared towards the U.S.).  &lt;strong&gt;People have lost their purpose,&lt;/strong&gt; and for diverse reasons, they feel like their world tomorrow is going to be worse than their world yesterday. To fix the economic aspect, corporations (with jobs that current and potential addicts could actually do and would actually want) must be lured back to the exurbs.  Tax breaks for fixing up decaying properties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There must be a philosophical and psychological remedy&lt;/strong&gt; to rescue the addicted and to prevent others from slipping into addiction.  This must be more than the government can arrange, although our leaders can use their positions and reputations to help.  It must be a massive cultural response that removes &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; and guilt from the addiction, and hostility from those who have never used.  Religious leaders, cultural icons, and police must begin to treat addicts with more compassion—even if they feel differently in private.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a public health standpoint, I believe more people need to be trained to administer narcan/naloxone, and it needs to be made more available, and cheaper.  &lt;strong&gt;Methodone clinics must open, alongside needle exchanges.&lt;/strong&gt;  (I personally think needle exchanges should be located at guilt-free police stations, to repair the bonds of trust between addicts and law enforcement, and because I think many police should change their feelings toward addicts.)  And doctors need to stop overprescribing painkillers for simple things; limit the supply to 5-days for most things.  And outright ban carfentanyl.  &lt;strong&gt;Legalize weed nationwide.  Consider decriminalizing or legalizing other illicit drugs,&lt;/strong&gt; based on non-partisan studies reviewed pragmatically by health professionals and unbiased Congresspeople.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a legal position, &lt;strong&gt;the government has got to go after pharmaceutical companies,&lt;/strong&gt; and pursue them mercilessly.  &lt;strong&gt;Transitioning away from our for-profit healthcare system is necessary&lt;/strong&gt; to stop the physical and financial abuse some of these corporations are inflicting upon Americans in search of higher profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a foreign policy and supply standpoint, we must recognize that &lt;strong&gt;most of the painkiller pills come from China.&lt;/strong&gt;  It&amp;#39;s like the Third Opium War, where China is getting revenge on the West. A diplomatic solution must be found.  &lt;strong&gt;Most of the heroin comes from plants grown in Afghanistan,&lt;/strong&gt; the production of which increased more than 1000% since we invaded in 2001—also America&amp;#39;s longest continuous war, ever.  What are we still doing there?  I hope these current negotiations with Afghanistan can work toward a solution, but I doubt they will.  Afghanistan is a shitshow and probably will be for the next 50 years; if it were more stable, you could develop the mining industry to give locals better jobs (this could be an opportunity for China to help).  If our planes are going to stay there anyway, I support using them to locate and/or burn poppy fields.  If our soldiers are going to be on the ground, they should help build roads and plant trees; it wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough to reverse the ill will America&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; over there, but it&amp;#39;s something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of these proposals wouldn&amp;#39;t really cost that much, as I see it.  (They &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, but they don&amp;#39;t have to.)  And what we&amp;#39;d save should be regarded as more important: working class Americans from all ages and backgrounds who are supposed to be treated with some degree of respect.  Most of these addicts are not productive members of society now, and a drain on our resources.  But the solution cannot be to let them wither and die.  It must be to invest time and resources wisely to help turn them into productive taxpayers and citizens with a renewed sense of gratitude and meaning towards their fellow Americans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So it's not old at all, but it is written by another Kerouac super-fan.  Check it out if you're interested.\n\nThe book is divided into 3 parts, with 85% of the book recounting my 17-day coast-to-coast journey to the Pacific.    Then there's a section about my hitchhiking tips &amp; tricks for the U.S. and my vagabonding philosophy.  And the last ten pages are mostly blank, for journaling space on the reader's travels.  The idea was that my book would become a sort of American hitchhiking companion book, but I haven't sold many copies at this point...it also didn't help that I was living in Asia when the book was released...\n\nI wrote Hitchhike America for a lay audience with little to no experience of modern hitchhiking, for people who want to live vicariously or learn how to hitchhike in America today.  I go into detail on how I spent every day on the road, excerpts of some of my driver conversations, and lots of stuff I saw and did along the way.  It's a very accessible and light read, only 198 pages total, easy to blaze through in a few hours.",

I've done some other hitchhiking in the States and a tiny bit in Africa, and I'm planning a cross-European journey.\n\nU/Storybot7's comment has summarized the differences and challenges as good as anyone could, I think.  \n\nI do want to emphasize that it will be more difficult if you're not white.  Sad to say, but true.\n\nI don't know about the rest of the world, but I suspect there will be uncomfortable moments where drivers come on to you or try to proposition you.

        "body": "Here's an excerpt from Day 6, leaving Memphis.\n\n&gt;I hit the crosswalk light, hoisted my backpack on, and waited for the light to change, my thumb still sticking out, pointing to the heavens.  The last car zoomed by and the light turned red, and I began walking to a patch of grass where I intended to eat some of my bread.  That’s when I heard a shout.\n\n&gt;“You want a lift?” I turned, but I couldn’t see who yelled it.  Then, a shaggy-looking man in denim overalls bounded to the crosswalk, with long black hair and an unkempt beard on top of a worn, scraggly, black bandana.\n\t\n&gt;“Yeah,” I shouted back, as he approached, stuck on the opposite side of the street.  “Where are you going?”\n\n&gt;“Little Rock!”\n\n&gt;“Great!”\n\n&gt;And so it was that I met Saul and Kara, two twenty-something friends on their way to Arkansas.  It had been the very last car that passed before I had decided to take a break.\n\n&gt;We stuffed my backpack into their car, which was loaded with junk.  They were coming back from Saul’s uncle’s house, which they had been cleaning for the past day and night.  His uncle was a hoarder, so odd treasures lined Saul’s compact, white automobile: a large metronome, books, clothes, a cactus, empty mason jars, some hats, a jaw harp, packets of seeds, and much, much more.  \n\n&gt;I sat in the front next to Kara, a large, friendly woman with a tuft of purple-dyed hair. She was driving, operating on fewer than three hours of sleep from the night before.  Saul was running on no sleep, cramped in the back with his guitar and a bust of Johann Sebastian Bach on his lap.\n\n&gt;“You reminded me of Paul Simon,” Kara told me.  “I said, ‘Saul, we have to stop for this man,’ and Saul was cool with it, so we pulled over.  You’re lucky we found you.  I made a wrong turn a little while back, and we wouldn’t have even been on this street if I had gone the way I wanted.”\n\n&gt;We crossed over the Mississippi River, a symbolic marker to the true American Midwest.  Behind us stood the blues capital of the world, ahead lay the open fields and lakes of Arkansas.\n\n&gt;“I like your bandanas,” Saul told me.  “It’s part of hobo culture to wear the same bandana for a long time, you know.  It’s like a mark of status how dirty and crusty they get.”\n\n&gt;“I never wear mine,” I admitted.  “They’re mostly for show, and to add some color to my bag.  Sometimes I use them to dry things.”  \n\n&gt;“You don’t smoke do you?” Kara asked me.  I noticed some cigarettes and rolling papers on the dashboard.\n\n&gt;“No, but it doesn’t bother me much if you do.”\n\n&gt;“I was going to roll one up.”\n\n&gt;“While you’re driving?”  I gave her a look. Kara was going close to 70 miles an hour down the highway, with a truck ahead of us and a van close behind.\n\n&gt;“Yeah,” she said.\n\t\n&gt;“Let me roll it,” I insisted.  “You’re going too fast and running on too little sleep and you really ought to keep a hand on the wheel.”\n\t\n&gt;“You can roll?”\n\t\n&gt;“I haven’t been out of college for that long,” I said.  “Besides, how well can someone roll while driving?”\n\n&gt;“You’d be surprised,” Saul said. “She’s awful good.”\n\t\n&gt;I took a book on Zen gardening from the floor and laid it on my lap, and put the tobacco and papers on top.  Kara wanted me to use half the tobacco from a cigarette—American Spirit—to roll one cigarette, and the other half for a second.  Saul tore the filter in half so I could use it in both.  A few minutes later I produced two small cigarettes.\n\t\n&gt;Kara took one and started fumbling for a lighter.  She found a small black lighter, but it didn’t work.  She kept looking for another, under disposable cups and on the shag floor of the vehicle.\n\n&gt;“Eyes on the road,” I cautioned.  I felt safer with Mannix driving than with her.  “I’ve got a light somewhere.”\n\t\n&gt;I pulled out my all-in-one tool, a can opener, tiny knife, corkscrew, and butane lighter.  I lit the cigarette for her, as we sped into the heart of Arkansas.\n\t\n&gt;“You see all these little lakes?” Saul asked, pointing to the side of the road.  Tiny bodies of shimmering water dotted the landscape, and thick, leafless trees jutted out from the lakes, crying for the sun, their bodies reflected in the clear water.  “There are loads of tiny ponds from tributaries of the Mississippi.  They’re technically parts of rivers, but they’re so calm.  They’ve been cut off from the river’s current.”\n\t\n&gt;“They’re beautiful,” I said.\n\t\n&gt;“It reminds me of Huck Finn, rafting down the Mississippi.  I can imagine him fishing at any one of these.  That reminds me,” he said, clearing his throat, “of a little song I wrote about Arkansas.”\n\n&gt;And Saul spontaneously broke into song, a gentle, lilting folk song about Arkansas, the Natural State, accompanied by his guitar.  I wish I remembered the lyrics, or the tune, but I’ve forgotten it all.\n",

Supposedly, Senator Joyce was offered free dry cleaning from a local place and began bringing his family's clothes there.  Then, as the story goes, some of his friends and staffers began bringing their clothes, and it's unclear how Joyce got that arrangement with the dry cleaner to begin with.  \n\nAnd there was the incident before that, where he used campaign funds to pay for one of his son's high school graduation parties, under the pretense that there were some constituents and important people in attendance.\n\nThese events are fairly minor, especially to warrant a federal indictment, so I suspect something else is going on that may come to light.

Alas, no treasure; also, I found some old fire pits and adolescent rubbish that would make me think Forrest was turned off to this place.\n\nIt's level ground on the trails around there, so an 80-year old man could make it there, but the further you go, you realize you've already walked for 45 minutes without carrying 21 lbs, and Forrest wouldn't've gone that far with half the gold on his back.\n\nYou might not trust me and need to go there yourself to believe as I do.
