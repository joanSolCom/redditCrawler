I'm volunteering to take on the risk of being a vaccine tester because I think it's worth it, but that's impossible without the rest of the health care system set up to handle a challenge trial. Part of that system is the health care workers, who are going to take on the risk of caring for/examining volunteers. I believe that health care workers DO make a choice, just much earlier than we did: they choose to enter a profession where they know there's a risk of them being exposed to infected patients. In that sense, they have much more of an active choice than most people. We all might be exposed to infected strangers on a regular basis, or we might be infected ourselves, not know it, and infect others at the grocery store. So in my view, that ethical concern is greater, and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible with a vaccine.\nSomething that's come up in 1Day Sooner meetings is that it's the right of volunteers to choose to take on this risk. Similarly, it's the right of health care workers to choose that profession in the first place, and to choose to stay in the profession during a pandemic. Like us, health care workers are probably often motivated to take on those risks out of a sense that it will make the world a better place. Health care has always been a heroic path, but I think that's even clearer right now. -Gavriel\n\nHey SeahawksBandwagoner! In addition to Gavriel's great response, I'd like to say this: A COVID challenge trial would likely take place under a rigorous safety procedure called [Biosafety Level 3](https://consteril.com/biosafety-levels-difference/), and in a facility designed for that level of security. Personal Protective Equipment, and likely a respirator, would be required, and there are self-closing and locking doors as well as hands-free sinks and eyewashes. I believe these are safer than many of the circumstances in which medical staff are currently treating COVID patients, but there would still be risk. In this pandemic, I've admired many healthcare professionals' bravery to continue to work at great personal sacrifice, and I think that it speaks highly of the profession that many would be willing to work in a challenge trial if it meant saving many lives through an earlier vaccine. -Wilson",

        "body": "Hey capilot! Thanks for your question. I think there is absolutely danger to volunteering in a challenge trial.\n\nTLDR: It is dangerous, but I think the risks are outweighed by the rewards.\n\nIt’s possible we could die in the short-term from COVID, although it’s unlikely—perhaps as low as 1 in 10,000 for a healthy 20-year-old. It’s possible that we could sustain serious non-fatal illness in the short-term. However, one advantage to contracting COVID in a trial is that the medical staff will know and be able to help—most ethicists believe challenge trial volunteers should have priority access to ventilators and other resources. Volunteers in a control group would also, by definition, be given a leading vaccine candidate early—which could raise or lower risks, depending on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. There also may be a rescue therapy by the time a trial were to take place. I also share concerns about serious chronic illnesses from COVID-19, whether that be diabetes or something we do not know. There is reason to believe COVID-19 can cause diabetes, and we don’t know how prevalent that is. Are there dangers? Absolutely. But, as a young health person, getting a vaccine out earlier would be worth the risk in my opinion.\n\nI also think that even if we assumed the dangers were much greater than they were, if the reward outweighs the risk volunteers should be able to do it. \n\nAt the age of 17, my great great grandfather, Frank Underhill, lied about his age to military recruiters to enter service with his brother in WWI. He drove a military ambulance. Now, I’ve never met him, but I think he was likely motivated by some sense of altruism. Although he survived, he ended up with chronic respiratory illness due to chemical weapons that likely ended his life early. I don’t know how informed he was of the risks, but he risked great personal danger for others, and I think our country is used to letting people take the kinds of risks that a soldier takes. (Due to misrepresenting his age, he also wasn’t able to start Social Security until 66, Ha!). Its hard to know for sure, but I feel the reward to personal risk ratio for me is much greater for a challenge trial than for WWI. —Wilson\n\nI agree with everything in Wilson's stellar response and would only add that there's no guarantee of avoiding the virus permanently even if we don't sign up for a trial! If I locked myself in the house and only got groceries every other month, I could contract the virus that one time in the grocery store, or when my housemates went. As Wilson says, this way, we'll get a calculated viral dose and excellent medical care.\nAnd if I were living in isolation like that for a year, I know my mental health/quality of life would be really bad. If I feel that way, millions of people who don't live in such nice places as I do would be even worse off. Millions of people are out of work. Millions of people are suffering. I'm extremely worried about the state of the country and the world. This is something I can do to help alleviate the suffering. I'm willing to take on the risks as well. -Gavriel",

That was essentially my first question when I signed up.\n\nThe biggest individual risk in the trial is basically that you get an ineffectual or a placebo vaccine. Vaccines have already been administered to people in earlier safety trials, so the risk for side effects is low--we'd know already if there were side effects from the vaccines themselves. With vaccines in general, the main possible side effect is basically just that you get the symptoms of the disease you're supposed to be inoculating against. -Gavriel\n\nHey lemonlemonlemonade! I think that's a great question! Since challenge trials involve being exposed to the virus as well as the vaccine, both are potential risk factors.\n\nAccording to a study published in Lancet Scientific, COVID-19 has an average short-term fatality rate of 3/10,000 among Americans 20-29 years of age. That's something to take seriously, for sure, but its comparable to other activities such as kidney donations or pregnancy. Additionally, we will be under continuous medical supervision in a medical facility by leading researchers during the trial, which lowers risk. Personally, I don't have any known underlying conditions, and am at the bottom of that study's age bracket, so my risk is likely lower. My biggest worry about getting COVID as a young healthy person would be that it may have some serious long-term effect we don't know about, much like we later found was the case with SARS or MERS.\n\nAs far as the dangers from the vaccine go, that's less quantifiable, and it will depend on what the vaccine candidate is. By the time that a human challenge trial volunteer would be exposed to the vaccine, it will have already been tested on smaller numbers of humans, so there's that. These dangers will also exist for non-challenge trial volunteers. --Wilson",

I'm also really touched and impressed by the number of people who have signed up--we're past 30k by now! I think that says something really beautiful about people wanting to do whatever they can to solve this. My friends and family have been extremely supportive and proud of me (although my parents added that they're worried for me, of course!). Their love and kind words are really sustaining me right now. -Gavriel\n\nHey thecaptaintrout! I feel weary, and hopeful, I think.  Although I definitely have many things going easier for me in this crisis, its hard to see so much suffering and apathy right now, at the same time as day-to-day life is more stressful. I'm also increasingly hopeful that challenge trials will happen, and that on a personal level I will leave the pandemic a stronger person than I entered it.\n\nThe friends and family I've talked to so far have been supportive. Some of them are surprised that I would be willing to potentially postpone my education for a semester, as school is a big part of my life--but when I point out that crises of similar scope have called for people to delay their life plans, my family seems to understand. -Wilson\n\nOne thing I'd add is that I think there's a decent chance (that is difficult to quantify) of getting COVID-19 over the coming months anyway, so the marginal risk of being exposed to COVID-19 in a lab setting with excellent healthcare does not stress me out immensely! - Abie",
