Some evidence suggests that children may be protected partially because they get some many upper respiratory tract infections including those cause by other coronaviruses which causes a level of immunity. Research on the immune response in children has also suggested they have a more protective type of immune response that doesn&amp;#39;t cause the nasty side effects that some adults suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Yes, there is a difference between landfill and personal compost. Compost heaps in people's gardens are usually relatively dry, and so  carbon in the food waste decays into carbon dioxide. However, landfill sites tend to be wetter, and so the air (oxygen) can't get in to help turn the carbon into carbon dioxide (CO2), so instead the carbon decomposes more into methane (CH4) which is ten times worse at retaining heat under the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (averaged over a 100 year time period). So it is better if people compost banana peels rather than sending them to landfill. Food waste decomposition at landfill sites adds typically 20% to the climate impact of food, so adding up all the types of food waste (not just banana peel) it is a big deal\nManufacturing fertilizer, and nitrous oxide from fertilizer application (whether organic manure or manufactured) are the main causes of on-farm climate impacts from producing plant-based foods (whether for human or animal consumption). The manufacture of fertilizer causes climate change because it uses a lot of energy to extract nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer, and usually this energy comes from burning fossil fuels",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a difference between landfill and personal compost. Compost heaps in people&amp;#39;s gardens are usually relatively dry, and so  carbon in the food waste decays into carbon dioxide. However, landfill sites tend to be wetter, and so the air (oxygen) can&amp;#39;t get in to help turn the carbon into carbon dioxide (CO2), so instead the carbon decomposes more into methane (CH4) which is ten times worse at retaining heat under the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (averaged over a 100 year time period). So it is better if people compost banana peels rather than sending them to landfill. Food waste decomposition at landfill sites adds typically 20% to the climate impact of food, so adding up all the types of food waste (not just banana peel) it is a big deal\nManufacturing fertilizer, and nitrous oxide from fertilizer application (whether organic manure or manufactured) are the main causes of on-farm climate impacts from producing plant-based foods (whether for human or animal consumption). The manufacture of fertilizer causes climate change because it uses a lot of energy to extract nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer, and usually this energy comes from burning fossil fuels&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think we can only make significant progress, and have a good discussion, when we have more transparent up-to-date information about how different food items (including brands) contribute to climate change. Ultimately I want to see mandatory accredited labels on all food packets showing their climate impact (gCO2e). To reach that goal we would need a lot of products already doing that voluntarily ... so I encourage you to support brands that already provide that information. In the UK I believe only Oatly and Quorn currently provide that information but hopefully soon more will follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "yeah, some of these higher climate impact foods do taste really good. I feel your pain! (I love slow roast lamb...mmm) There is a big variation in climate impacts between different farming practices e.g. see this beautiful graphic from the fabulous Our World in Data project https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#less-meat-is-nearly-always-better-for-your-carbon-footprint-than-sustainable-meat e.g. there's a huge range for beef. Unfortunately this information is mostly not available to consumers. I really want to see climate impact labelling (gCO2e) on each food packet so I can choose the lowest impact food within a category e.g. lowest impact steak. You can also see in the graphic that despite the huge range for beef, it doesn't overlap much with the plant-based foods. So again I'd take it back to quantities and frequency. If you eat a lot of steak e.g. if you ate it daily then its probably your biggest contributor to climate change from your food:  an average 8oz steak produced in Europe causes more climate change than a whole day of food for an average person in the world (~10kg emissions cf ~6kg emissions). On the other hand, if you ate steak just twice a year, then the numbers say that this would increase your total food climate impact by 1 percent i.e. not much (2 8oz steaks a year = 2*10kg of emissions = 20kg cf average food emissions per year of 365*6kg = 2190kg so 20/2190 = 0.01 - I'm assuming reddit readers are geeks who want numbers - you can ignore the numbers if you're not that geeky :)",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah, some of these higher climate impact foods do taste really good. I feel your pain! (I love slow roast lamb...mmm) There is a big variation in climate impacts between different farming practices e.g. see this beautiful graphic from the fabulous Our World in Data project &lt;a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#less-meat-is-nearly-always-better-for-your-carbon-footprint-than-sustainable-meat\"&gt;https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#less-meat-is-nearly-always-better-for-your-carbon-footprint-than-sustainable-meat&lt;/a&gt; e.g. there&amp;#39;s a huge range for beef. Unfortunately this information is mostly not available to consumers. I really want to see climate impact labelling (gCO2e) on each food packet so I can choose the lowest impact food within a category e.g. lowest impact steak. You can also see in the graphic that despite the huge range for beef, it doesn&amp;#39;t overlap much with the plant-based foods. So again I&amp;#39;d take it back to quantities and frequency. If you eat a lot of steak e.g. if you ate it daily then its probably your biggest contributor to climate change from your food:  an average 8oz steak produced in Europe causes more climate change than a whole day of food for an average person in the world (~10kg emissions cf ~6kg emissions). On the other hand, if you ate steak just twice a year, then the numbers say that this would increase your total food climate impact by 1 percent i.e. not much (2 8oz steaks a year = 2&lt;em&gt;10kg of emissions = 20kg cf average food emissions per year of 365&lt;/em&gt;6kg = 2190kg so 20/2190 = 0.01 - I&amp;#39;m assuming reddit readers are geeks who want numbers - you can ignore the numbers if you&amp;#39;re not that geeky :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Thanks for your great question. Recycling is important for lots of reasons - in terms of climate change it reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the energy needed to recycle is lower than that needed to extract + use the raw materials. But for most foods, the contents of the packaging has a bigger impact on climate change than the packaging itself. For the most part, animal-based foods cause more climate change than plant-based foods (per gram of food or per gram of protein), though it depends a lot on farming practices, and e.g. air-freighted fruit and veg can cause similar climate impacts as the lower emissions meats like chicken. There are big differences in climate impacts between different types of food e.g. an 8oz steak and fries dinner causes over 20 times the climate impact of a microwaved potato and beans - so we can make a big difference by changing our choices. Luckily some of these changes don't break the bank (beans are cheaper than steak!), though I know from personal experience that experimenting with new meals doesn't always go down so well with the kids, so that part is tough... For most people, the simplest place to start is quantities: e.g. halving the quantity of the meat, while adding more veggies! You're right that composting helps - food waste sent to landfill causes extra emissions because it decomposes into methane, a potent greenhouse gas - whereas composting decomposes mostly to carbon dioxide. I know its tough with kids to avoid food waste, but again it can also save money. In our house fwiw, people help themselves from cooking bowl/tray, and if you put it on your plate you need to eat it up, or promise to take less next time! Hope that helps!",
