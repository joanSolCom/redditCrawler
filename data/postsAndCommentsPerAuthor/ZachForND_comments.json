Meanwhile, regular Americans received a one-time stimulus, their healthcare was not protected and small business owners grappled for hours to access PPP funds that even went to large business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congress could have helped take over payroll for the duration of the crisis, they could have guaranteed people&amp;#39;s healthcare coverage, instead the actions of Congress have resulted in the largest re-distribution of wealth upwards that we have ever seen. That continued consolidation of wealth and power, at a time when the economic foundation of many Americans was already shaky, has me very concerned about the future of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan to highlight these issues and more from the framework that economic investments in actual people are not scary or radical, they are as American as apple pie. We can return to the New Deal roots of the Democratic party and actually make investments that benefit Americans across the board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do that, we need to tackle the issue of just who Congress is looking to serve today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I wanted to ensure I could answer properly.\n\nI think you bring up a lot of great points.

Unfortunately, the federal government has helped to create a lot of these broken incentive structures. Guaranteeing loans had good intentions, but it ended up creating the bloated mess we see today.\n\nPublic college is not at all a perfect solution, but I think it is one that makes progress. You are right that quality should be a major concern when talking higher ed, and I'm always happy to hear ideas on how to tackle that. I just also believe the system we see today is horrible. North Dakotan universities may be more affordable, but they are still outlandishly expensive for many working families.\n\nI also hear you on the boilerplate feedback. I'm eager to continue learning and provide more specifics as time goes on. It really boils down to fundamental priorities in my mind. There may not be a lot of meat as far as actual text in said legislation, direct funding mechanisms, but it's of my belief that people are ready to finally hear these sorts of investments being talked about **at all**. Unless pressured by this campaign, I highly doubt we will see Congressman Armstrong addressing these issues from the perspective of federal dollar investments.\n\nSo, as the campaign progresses, I'm looking forward to receiving similar feedback to help fully flesh these policy positions out.

Instead, I believe voters in North Dakota feel like the democratic party, on a national level, has not had the interest of working people as a priority. I believe if we advocate for bold solutions to the needs of working people that we can see a resurgence of the Democratic-NPL presence in this state. The issues that I am running on are ones that the voters of North Dakota have not had the chance to hear and vote on. I am excited to bring them forward because I strongly believe it will help us engage folks that have given up on the political process, namely young people and working people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I believe strongly that the Democrats need to return to their FDR-centric roots and become the party of working people again. Few know that North Dakota used to have a fully Democrat federal delegation as recently as 2011. I will not tow the party line. If a policy is not good for our state, I will not vote for it to appease party establishment figures.\n\n2. If elected, I think that alone will send an incredibly strong message. I am a 26 year old working person taking on an incumbent that won by thirty points last time around. I am hopeful that our victory would inspire countless other working people across the country to step up and get involved. As far as actual post-election action, I would work hard to ensure these policy positions get the chance to be heard and voted on.

I believe strongly that the Democrats need to return to their FDR-centric roots and become the party of working people again. Few know that North Dakota used to have a fully Democrat federal delegation as recently as 2011. I will not tow the party line. If a policy is not good for our state, I will not vote for it to appease party establishment figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If elected, I think that alone will send an incredibly strong message.

Over the past decade, corporate and individual state income tax rates have been cut *five* times. As a result, North Dakota's budget is extremely reliant on commodities, primarily oil and agriculture. In fact, one of every two dollars of state money is coming directly from oil and gas revenues. \n\nThat said, there is still an opportunity to advocate for the energies of the future. While the hardline rhetoric from national candidates, ie. banning fracking completely won't play well around here, I'm confident North Dakotans would support increased federal investments into the R&amp;D of clean and renewable energy sources.\n\nI will be a strong advocate to ensure we don't get left behind as other nations work to become the leader in these growing technologies. While fossil fuel sources keep our furnaces running today, we can work to create an energy grid that is diverse and relies less on fossil fuels. There are great opportunities in this state to create good paying jobs and invest in the energies of the future.",
