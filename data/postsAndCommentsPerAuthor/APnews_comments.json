We'll tackle most of them here, then once you know how to buy, you'll be able to pick off that question about titles yourself.\n\nThere are two versions of the AP Stylebook. They both contain current AP style guidance, written and edited by AP's team. We sell the spiral-bound edition on [http://apstylebook.com](http://apstylebook.com/). Our 2019 book, which is the yellow one you mention, debuted May 29. Our publishing partner, Hachette, sells the perfect-bound edition in retail outlets including Barnes &amp; Noble. Hachette will release its 2019 book shortly. It's the blue one you refer to.\n\nThe 2019 AP Stylebook e-book [is available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Associated-Press-Stylebook-2019-ebook/dp/B07SJ4Z4X4). The content is identical to our spiral-bound edition, including the cover. Bonus: You don't pay shipping and you get it immediately.\n\nIt's absolutely proper to use AP style for your newsletters. The AP Stylebook got its start as a resource for journalists, but today we serve a wide, diverse audience that includes PR professionals and marketers who use AP style to guide their writing in press releases, on websites, on social media and more.\n\nPeople tell us they chose AP style because our guidance aims to make content understood by the kind of general audience AP serves itself. We aren't aiming for a niche academic audience, for example, but to help make ideas clear for the kind of heterogeneous readership a local newspaper might reach. They also like that we aim for clear guidance that's easy to follow. Most of our entries are pretty simple, spelling out one suggested way, which is helpful if you don't have a background in writing or if you're just busy and don't want to sit and deliberate. (Some of the more complex issues do require consideration, but no one said writing well is easy.)\n\nFirst thing is to decide what tone you're trying to achieve with your newsletter, then choose a resource that will help you get there. If you choose the Chicago Manual of Style because you want a more author-like feel, CMoS does a great job at what it does. If you pick the AP Stylebook [because it meets your needs](https://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/1134141687071215616), Carol Saller on the CMoS team supports that, too.",

Colleen Newvine, who manages our AP Stylebook products, has some more details:  \n\n[AP Stylebook Online](https://store.stylebooks.com/apstylebookonline.html) is updated throughout the year. We print a spiral-bound Stylebook every spring, collecting all the changes we've made since the last edition, and often saving a few goodies for the new edition.\n\nThe online version is more comprehensive than the book.

We'll tackle most of them here, then once you know how to buy, you'll be able to pick off that question about titles yourself.\n\nThere are two versions of the AP Stylebook. They both contain current AP style guidance, written and edited by AP's team. We sell the spiral-bound edition on [http://apstylebook.com](http://apstylebook.com/). Our 2019 book, which is the yellow one you mention, debuted May 29. Our publishing partner, Hachette, sells the perfect-bound edition in retail outlets including Barnes &amp; Noble. Hachette will release its 2019 book shortly. It's the blue one you refer to.\n\nThe 2019 AP Stylebook e-book [is available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Associated-Press-Stylebook-2019-ebook/dp/B07SJ4Z4X4). The content is identical to our spiral-bound edition, including the cover. Bonus: You don't pay shipping and you get it immediately.\n\nIt's absolutely proper to use AP style for your newsletters. The AP Stylebook got its start as a resource for journalists, but today we serve a wide, diverse audience that includes PR professionals and marketers who use AP style to guide their writing in press releases, on websites, on social media and more.\n\nPeople tell us they chose AP style because our guidance aims to make content understood by the kind of general audience AP serves itself. We aren't aiming for a niche academic audience, for example, but to help make ideas clear for the kind of heterogeneous readership a local newspaper might reach. They also like that we aim for clear guidance that's easy to follow. Most of our entries are pretty simple, spelling out one suggested way, which is helpful if you don't have a background in writing or if you're just busy and don't want to sit and deliberate. (Some of the more complex issues do require consideration, but no one said writing well is easy.)\n\nFirst thing is to decide what tone you're trying to achieve with your newsletter, then choose a resource that will help you get there. If you choose the Chicago Manual of Style because you want a more author-like feel, CMoS does a great job at what it does.

By virtue of the fact that lots of people didn’t know exactly what the location history setting was doing, a lot of historical location data has now been stored in peoples’ Google accounts.

Sometimes there is just one ticket left at the lowest price and if you search for three, all three will be at the higher price.\n\nAs for the rest of your question:\n\nOn budgeting: I crowdsource with locals on Facebook - someone always knows someone who lives in the place I’m going - and I ask them - hey what do you do locally on your weekends? The locals aren’t paying a lot of money to have fun - they know where the cool, great, free stuff is, the cheap eats. Also I once hosted a German tourist and she had made a spreadsheet of every museum’s free hours in the city of New York. That’s something worth doing. Public transit, too. \n\nFor souvenirs - I go for food when I can. On a visit to Alabama, I visited a pecan processing store and bought bags of pecans to bring home. What’s great is it doesn’t require someone to own the thing forever - they can consume it or give it away without guilty conscience. I look for fun candy - in Hawaii, we found coconut M&amp;Ms that we’d never seen on the East Coast (though they later introduced them here) and unique local booze - in Portugal, the cherry liqueur is a thing and I was able to find tiny bottles as gifts.

        "body": "Most underrated US travel site: North Dakota. It's the 50th state for lots of folks doing the country but Teddy Roosevelt Park is stunning.\n\nBest region if you're rich: Aspen in winter, Nantucket in summer.\n\nBest region if you're poor: It can be expensive to find hotels in NYC but if you can figure out the lodging piece - there are SO many free things to do here and honestly great food that's cheap. And all transportation comes here - you can get cheap flights, buses etc. Just don't try to park.\n\nBiggest difference in quality of experiences: I will answer this one in a kind of literal way. If you are planning a trip to see NYC from up high, make sure it's a clear day. You can literally see the curvature of the earth from the top of the Empire State Building on a clear day but if it's cloudy, fuggettabout it\n\nLong term vs short term: For me, I need a nice quiet couple weeks in the country just staring at the sky to unwind and there are lots of places to do that. Short term - Most big cities offer so many great things to do that a weekend feels like a lifetime. New Orleans or New York, short term, I think deliver a big bang for your buck.\n\nFree places NYC: You got me on Amazon loft, idk that one. Impressive, I'll have to check it out. The Red Hook pier has a great view of Statue of Liberty. Personally I love walking the 3-mile loop in Prospect Park. And even though it's not a secret, honestly, the 9/11 park is tranquil and beautiful - a place unto itself. I often go to sit there on a bench, to contemplate that awful day but also to feel proud of my city for this message of hope and recovery.

Some also raise safety concerns - fire codes etc. ANd then there's the whole airbnbwhileblack issue. The company is trying to address these concerns, of course, and lots of people love Airbnb. It’s made travel affordable for folks who find hotels too expensive. There are pros and cons to using it, as with any travel decision. Personally I admit to looking for good deals in chain hotels and then plan my itineraries carefully to find those fun, authentic things in neighborhoods and offbeat spots as activities. Couchsurfing - never done it! I'm kind of a prima donna when it comes to the perfect pillow... ",

Some also raise safety concerns - fire codes etc. ANd then there&amp;#39;s the whole airbnbwhileblack issue. The company is trying to address these concerns, of course, and lots of people love Airbnb. It’s made travel affordable for folks who find hotels too expensive. There are pros and cons to using it, as with any travel decision. Personally I admit to looking for good deals in chain hotels and then plan my itineraries carefully to find those fun, authentic things in neighborhoods and offbeat spots as activities. Couchsurfing - never done it! I&amp;#39;m kind of a prima donna when it comes to the perfect pillow... &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
