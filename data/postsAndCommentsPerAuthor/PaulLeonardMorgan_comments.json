        "body": "Never too late! It depends what you consider my \"usual style\" to be 😁 I like varying it up. I was classically trained with big orchestras at the Conservatoire (as they call it now) in Scotland. but then spent the next 10 years or so in a wee studio out the back of the main recording studio in Glasgow. (cava). So I was doing string arrangements for all the bands, and seeing how Neve Legend consoles work, ProTool, etc. Seeing how rhodes keyboards and guitars would be used in tracks, how to create those sounds. I started buying stuff - akai s3200, and really getting into drum programming - had a korf 01WFD for jeyboard, added a NORD, JP 8080, had a Jupiter, etc. I LOVED those sounds, and always used those in my scores. I'd been doing some synth work and programming on No Doubt's album for Spike Stent when I got to do Limitless. Then I just kind of became the \"electronica\" guy for a while, as people dg the different vibe, I guess? But I was always into Dance, electronic music, clubbing, etc! I think all those things gradually morph into your style. Then along comes Dredd, which started off with a band / gtr, vibe, and I remember saying to Alex G at the end, I don't think I've nailed this yet, I want to go back and try it with a few of these synths. (The one which you hear on Don't fuck with mama, ro whatever it's called) and finally that felt right, so I went back and redid a load of it with those sounds. I LOVE trying out new things, as that's the buzz - when suddenly all those sounds melt into one and become a new vibe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not beer I need for remixing, it's time!

I was classically trained with big orchestras at the Conservatoire (as they call it now) in Scotland. but then spent the next 10 years or so in a wee studio out the back of the main recording studio in Glasgow. (cava). So I was doing string arrangements for all the bands, and seeing how Neve Legend consoles work, ProTool, etc. Seeing how rhodes keyboards and guitars would be used in tracks, how to create those sounds. I started buying stuff - akai s3200, and really getting into drum programming - had a korf 01WFD for jeyboard, added a NORD, JP 8080, had a Jupiter, etc. I LOVED those sounds, and always used those in my scores. I&amp;#39;d been doing some synth work and programming on No Doubt&amp;#39;s album for Spike Stent when I got to do Limitless. Then I just kind of became the &amp;quot;electronica&amp;quot; guy for a while, as people dg the different vibe, I guess? But I was always into Dance, electronic music, clubbing, etc! I think all those things gradually morph into your style. Then along comes Dredd, which started off with a band / gtr, vibe, and I remember saying to Alex G at the end, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve nailed this yet, I want to go back and try it with a few of these synths.

Working on games is WAY different from films - and yes, definitely harder. With FILMS, you have specific times that you want things to happen. (hit points). E.g. someone pulls out a gun, someone kisses, someone hits a window and breaks it. You time those to perfection with changing tempos, etc. With GAMES, it's a much more technical process. It's non-linear - there is no start and end to the track, per se. (unless it's a Cut scene, where you just sit back and watch it as a player). So the track is a loop, which by itself has to have highs and lows and sound interesting. But the track often consists of different layers, depending on how the game is programmed. E.g. in Hardline we had 4 main layers. Walk into the room, you hear layer 1 (maybe some synths and atmos pads). Then a baddie walks in, layer 2 comes in as well, making the track louder and more intense. Shit's happening! So maybe adding some low-key drums and a bass line. Then HE PULLS THE GUN&gt; layer 3 comes up (tensions layer - distorted sound), and layers 1 and 2 get muted. Then he escapes - layer 4 comes in (big drums, guitar, etc) as well as layer 1 and 2. 3 gets muted. All those things happen with trigger points in the programming, so when you walk past a motorbike, for example, the coding tells the computer to start the next layer, or go on to the next music track. And the trick is getting those bits seamless, so players don't notice - you don't want to be taken out of the moment! It's really technical, and blows my mind!",

You see all these amazingly talented people come out of USC, Berklee, etc, and I think F\\*\\*k they're good with technique. But sometimes missing a bit of heart and soul/melody. So when I started out I was classically trained at Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Started hanging around with bands at this studio called Cava. Then started working on short films with people that liked those bands. Then worked with more bands who liked those films. And then it all just kind of took off. Technically I was shit, but I write good music which was pretty original (I like to think!). My first film score got a best newcomer BAFTA, which then got me an agent in London who got me my first tv gig, which got nominated for BAFTA and ivor novello. That director, Omar, went on to do a series called Spooks in the UK, and brought me with him. That went on for 5 or 6 seasons! But I got really good, technically, and was also writing really quickly - like 2 days per episode for 60 minutes of original music. Then got my break with Limitless (got to pitch on it through a great guy in New York who like my music). That went to number one in world, which def helps! Then did Dredd, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for games, I haven't done a ton of them - I have so much admiration for the composers that are great at scoring them, as it's such a unique talent / technical process. After I had done Dredd, I got a call from EA Games about Battlefield Hardline. That took about 2 and a half years, they wanted more of a band / urban edge (nothing like Dredd instruments wise). We got to use the amazing Josh Freese (NIN) on drums, and was just an all round fun experiecne. Paul Gorman, the music guys at EA, held my hand through the process and told me what as working and what wasn't - it's so different from films, and it was my first one! Then I did a VR game which was amazingly fun and crazy, and Dawn of War 3. Again, it just helps when people have heard some of your stuff, I think? So you can at least have those initial conversations... It's ALL SO MUCH FUN! And I LOVE the teamwork behind games. Feels so great. I remember flying to Vanvouver to Relic during Dawn of War, and someone said \"It's an honour to meet you Mr Leonard-Morgan, I love your soundtracks, and listen to Dredd while I programme.\". He was a programmer, and I don't think I've ever not been called PLM or Paul in my life. And there was this amazingly talented guy feeling humble at coming up to me?!! I soon put him right ;-)",

I guess they're my least favourite part, as they don't feel quite as creative? They don't give you that surge of excitement and energy that creating fresh tracks does.

I guess they&amp;#39;re my least favourite part, as they don&amp;#39;t feel quite as creative? They don&amp;#39;t give you that surge of excitement and energy that creating fresh tracks does. Although, bizarrely, there&amp;#39;s something immensely satisfying about chopping up your music to fit new cuts (if it&amp;#39;s something the music editor can&amp;#39;t do) and seeing it suddenly fit perfectly when you&amp;#39;ve changed it around a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I'll watch it once with temp music that they've put in there, then switch that off, watch the movie a few times and then switch the screens off. Go for a run, a walk, anything really. Mull it over in my head for a week while trying different vibes out. I like to just go and write some long themes and tracks - whether it's real instruments, sitting at my grand piano, or f\\*\\*king around with synths.

(So I'm just imagining the film in my head for the first week.) Then I do about 3 or 4 days all-nighters, to do a first pass (my first attempt) at the whole film, to get the flow going, go and crash for a nights' sleep, then go back and start tweaking. Normally by the end of the first pass, you're really developing melodies / sounds / discovering your colour palette, so then you go back over the start on your second pass with all these new, dope ideas. Some composers like to do certain parts of the film first. For me, I like just blitzing it through the entire thing and seeing what works. It's kind of like getting in the rhythm of the thing",
