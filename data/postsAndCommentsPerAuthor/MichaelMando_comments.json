I am lucky because it&amp;#39;s a character who wants to head away from the dark and into the light - so my inner thoughts with him are always pushing me to better myself as a person&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I remember digging my protective ear plugs so deep that I had to had the medic pull them out with a tweezer. I held on to them in my fist until we started shooting... When the director yelled action and I turned around to deliver \"Can I make the call now...\" and Victor (played by the wonderful Jeremiah Bitsui) was about to pull the trigger, I realized I forgot to put the ear plugs back in and I still had them in my fist... the gunshot, who was a full load, echoed like thunder in the dry desert and as I fell down my ears were completely shot - I couldn't hear a thing. Two voices came to mind, the first was yelling in my head \"we have to cut right now, something went terribly wrong\", the other, the actor one said \"stfu and use it!\" Lol. I believe that's the take that's in the cut.",

I remember digging my protective ear plugs so deep that I had to had the medic pull them out with a tweezer. I held on to them in my fist until we started shooting... When the director yelled action and I turned around to deliver &amp;quot;Can I make the call now...&amp;quot; and Victor (played by the wonderful Jeremiah Bitsui) was about to pull the trigger, I realized I forgot to put the ear plugs back in and I still had them in my fist... the gunshot, who was a full load, echoed like thunder in the dry desert and as I fell down my ears were completely shot - I couldn&amp;#39;t hear a thing. Two voices came to mind, the first was yelling in my head &amp;quot;we have to cut right now, something went terribly wrong&amp;quot;, the other, the actor one said &amp;quot;stfu and use it!&amp;quot; Lol. I believe that&amp;#39;s the take that&amp;#39;s in the cut.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
