If you're jamming by yourself definitely get a loop pedal so you can put down some chords and jam over that.

So it's normal for me to practice them.  Music production I also had lessons in when I was 16/17 or so and then studied Music Technology at college (we also had classes in uni).   Keys is something that I feel like you just pick up when learning music theory, it's such a good instrument to have the basics down on, and I picked that up much much later, I'm a very very basic keys player (that's what Hannah is for haha), but I think it's a beautiful instrument so that's why I play it.  I think the main think is you have to WANT to.  If you want to you will find a way; if you don't, you will make an excuse- it's as simple as that. I kind of wish I'd studied keys more seriously earlier, but at the time I just wanted to study and get better at guitar, so that's what I did.  I don't have scheduled practice routine for this, I just pick up and play what I want to. \n\nHmm yes, sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  I usually sit down and practice very regimental stuff, like get a practice book out of bebop scales or something, once I get playing I find it hard to stop, it's the getting started that is sometimes hard when you're feeling a bit shit or uninspired.  A good tune for sure gets me itching to jam along.  Or, going to an instrument that you're not 'supposed' to be good at I find really refreshing. Which is why I love playing piano, I love that I don't have to be good, or play anything complex. Whereas with guitar I feel like I have to play complex harmony or scales or just something that's impressive.  \n\nI'm actually not 100% sure, we get a decent pay out from PRS but if we were living solely form streaming/downloads we wouldn't be able to fully live from music.  We definitely need the other avenues on income too.  To be living off streams solely you need to be getting plenty of mil streams on every song.\nHope that helped.\nA",

Some months you can do really well, and nothing to worry about (financially anyway), and other months you can be like, uh-oh this better pick up.  There's so much to think about when you're at the stage where things are happening but you don't have a whole team helping to do stuff.  So you're doing everything, managing yourself, planning what you can do to get to the next steps, making these things happen, contacting people, replying to emails, sorting out contracts for brand promo/gigs etc. Keeping on top of invoices, finances.  Writing music, practicing instruments, producing tracks, making content for Instagram, YouTube, Patreon, TikTok etc, thinking about your 'brand', things have to all fit together and be aesthetically coherent.   etc etc etc I could go on, there is endless amounts to be done.\nI'm personally super super ambitious and I put a lot of pressure on myself to achieve so I find it quite hard to enjoy having much of a social life, I'd rather be working, but then sometimes that becomes a bit unhealthy.  There are so many ups and downs, you can get news that I don't know say you got a decent sync and it can make you feel like everything is great, and then you can not get the sync and it make you feel rubbish until something good happens.  I think it's part of being a creative and in a creative industry that things seem either great or terrible, but the 'ok' phases do happen too.  I have a vision for where I see myself in x amount of time and that's most what keeps me up at night, how I can get to that point, always always thinking about what I can do next. \nHope that answered your question. \nA",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh gosh, so many haha.  It&amp;#39;s definitely super stressful (for me anyway), as it&amp;#39;s very insecure.  Some months you can do really well, and nothing to worry about (financially anyway), and other months you can be like, uh-oh this better pick up.  There&amp;#39;s so much to think about when you&amp;#39;re at the stage where things are happening but you don&amp;#39;t have a whole team helping to do stuff.  So you&amp;#39;re doing everything, managing yourself, planning what you can do to get to the next steps, making these things happen, contacting people, replying to emails, sorting out contracts for brand promo/gigs etc. Keeping on top of invoices, finances.  Writing music, practicing instruments, producing tracks, making content for Instagram, YouTube, Patreon, TikTok etc, thinking about your &amp;#39;brand&amp;#39;, things have to all fit together and be aesthetically coherent.   etc etc etc I could go on, there is endless amounts to be done.\nI&amp;#39;m personally super super ambitious and I put a lot of pressure on myself to achieve so I find it quite hard to enjoy having much of a social life, I&amp;#39;d rather be working, but then sometimes that becomes a bit unhealthy.  There are so many ups and downs, you can get news that I don&amp;#39;t know say you got a decent sync and it can make you feel like everything is great, and then you can not get the sync and it make you feel rubbish until something good happens.  I think it&amp;#39;s part of being a creative and in a creative industry that things seem either great or terrible, but the &amp;#39;ok&amp;#39; phases do happen too.  I have a vision for where I see myself in x amount of time and that&amp;#39;s most what keeps me up at night, how I can get to that point, always always thinking about what I can do next. \nHope that answered your question. \nA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

From my videos brands would contact me and ask me to promo/review products and that's still a main source of income.  From social media I've been able to promote my own music and push that so now make money from that.  I sopped doing session work about 3 years ago ish.

So yes the musician should be paid for the session if that's what they have been hired to do, but they should also get PPL, so when they song is played on the radio etc, they are getting some payment.  TBH we don't work like this.  We usually are in the room with other musicians, maybe a producer who plays some instruments and a songwriter, who may or may not.  And all of us are writing the song, we we all get a cut of the song.  I have never hired someone in just to play an instrument.  But yeah make sure if you or any you knows plays on a song that you are registered on it with PPL.

So it's actually pretty different each time, I don't really have a structure to my work flow, but with looping I'll 99% of the time know pretty much exactly what I'm going to play before I go to record it.   So I'll get some ideas, loop them in, pick up a different instrument, add something, delete something and just keep going like this until I have a track I like.  Then I'll usually sit down at ableton and arrange it how I want it, so maybe I played the guitar part first when I was jamming but actually want to start with the keys, so I'll get it how I want it.  Remember how that is and THEN go to record it. \n\nSet up:  Guitar goes into Kemper then into interface (Focusrite 18i8), sometimes I'll DI straight into the interface depending on where I am and what gear I have with me.  Keyboard is 90% of the time MIDI (Hannah mostly uses audio though and does sound changes either on the keyboard or via ableton).  Bass I DI (for live stuff as my Kemper only has one input).  The push is MIDI via USB cable.  SPD is also MIDI via USB (I use it to trigger in ableton, so hitting the pads triggers a drum rack in Ableton, I don't have sounds on the pads themselves).   Anything else, if it's audio will go in to the interface and if not then connected via USB.\n\nLooping: It depends what kind of thing I'm playing as to whether I use arrange view or session view. Mostly when you see my using the Push I'm using session/clip view where I trigger clips which then record.  I use 'fixed length' to control how long I want the loops to be.  \nIf I'm using arrange view then everything looping is automated so I don't have to trigger anything whilst I play, this is a lot more prep.\n\nHope that answers some questions for you. Let me know if you want to know anything specific too.\n\nA",
