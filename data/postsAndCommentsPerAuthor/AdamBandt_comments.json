One that you can live on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So coming out of COVID, we&amp;#39;re opposing the cuts to JobSeeker and JobKeeper, we&amp;#39;re pushing for a lift in the minimum wage and we&amp;#39;re moving to outlaw insecure work.  As part of this, we&amp;#39;ll be arguing that there should be a &amp;#39;guaranteed income&amp;#39; that everyone gets as a minimum. When we launch our full Green New Deal next year, we&amp;#39;ll have more to say about it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This weekend we have 5 separate groups of volunteers are out doorknocking and hitting the phones. People are telling us they are very disappointed in Labor but Tony Abbott is no alternative so we are the clear choice.

Currently the big banks borrow a proportion of their funding from the international wholesale funding market and according to the IMF, they obtain more favourable rates because of the implicit “too-big-too-fail” policy of the government. In other words if one of the big banks was get in trouble, the funders know the Australia taxpayer would bail them out. We are proposing that the big banks pay a very small levy in return for that support. It would not have a major impact on their bottom lines and would improve the competiveness and diversity of the sector because it would create a more level playing field for the smaller institutions. Of course when you propose any increase in tax, those being taxed will cry poor. This is what the big banks have done.\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/greens-call-for-super-tax-on-big-four-banks-20130307-2fohw.html\n",

Currently the big banks borrow a proportion of their funding from the international wholesale funding market and according to the IMF, they obtain more favourable rates because of the implicit “too-big-too-fail” policy of the government. In other words if one of the big banks was get in trouble, the funders know the Australia taxpayer would bail them out. We are proposing that the big banks pay a very small levy in return for that support. It would not have a major impact on their bottom lines and would improve the competiveness and diversity of the sector because it would create a more level playing field for the smaller institutions. Of course when you propose any increase in tax, those being taxed will cry poor. This is what the big banks have done.\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/greens-call-for-super-tax-on-big-four-banks-20130307-2fohw.html\"&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/greens-call-for-super-tax-on-big-four-banks-20130307-2fohw.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
