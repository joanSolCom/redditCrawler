I thought my family hated me. I thought I was unlovable. I was trapped in a cell that was my own making and I look up into the mirror closet door to see a face I didn’t recognize anymore surrounded with the wreckage of 37 years that had the soundtrack of a “pity-pat, drop drop drop” as the plastic spun on a tabletop, empty, after I reached for it, missed, and landed on all fours. I looked up, “God help me,” and I heard something that to this day I can’t explain. “It’s over Leo, the game is up,” and an unbelievable fear was lifted from me and replaced with an unbelievable hope.

The last day that I took a drink in order to feel like I was part of something, the last day I believed the lie: the last day that I stopped lying to myself, to those that I love the most, and to everyone else. Now it's 9 years that I am completely clean and sober. 9 years later where I chose to call a friend instead of a pseudo -assassin decorated with lottery scratchers and a “good morning” or with a handshake with a bag in it. 9 years since I chose not to seek a revolver but instead gave my will and my life over to a community for guidance which was given to me so graciously. I have gained true friends that I have grown to know – their support continues to be unmatched. My family, which has grown to include my baby daughter, has never given up on me; but, when they felt like it, my community was there. Love abounds. Now I am going to go enjoy another day: that’s all I have today, but damn it’s a good day. My bed is made, my mirrors are clean, and I like what I see. I still have plenty of living to do.\n\n\\- Leo from the [Lionrock](https://www.lionrockrecovery.com/) team",

While it is just one day at a time, I have been able to remain clean and sober, one day at a time for 14 years. Not every day is cupcakes and rainbows, as you said. I have to be mindful and walk through feelings that I never knew had a beginning, middle, and an end. THE FEELINGS HAVE AN END! Who knew?! I sure didn't till I got sober and started to feel them all the way through.   \n\n\nThis weekend, I am going to see my sponsor take a chip at our outdoor meeting. Then a group of us sober moms are going to take our kids over to her house to swim. While we are there, I am sure we will talk shop about being sober and #momlife. Being a sober mom is tough business! \n\nWhen the weekends get hard, I remind people to plan them out. We don't plan to fail; we fail to plan! Map out the meetings (online or otherwise) that you will attend. There are a TON of free support groups that include both 12 step and NON-12 Step, on the website [Lionrock.Life](https://Lionrock.Life). They are open to anyone recovering from anything. There are alcohol-specific ones if that is what you are looking for, though. Once you know your meeting schedule, figure out what things bring you joy and make sure you are doing at least one of them every day. AT LEAST ONE! A bit of sunshine (or nature) and exercise will give you the \"feel good\" chemicals that we love and sprinkle in the stuff that needs to get done. Planning is an amazing tool to keep you on track. Sending love and light! xo Ashley + The Lionrock Team",

Planning is an amazing tool to keep you on track. Sending love and light! xo Ashley + The Lionrock Team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Take what you want from it. There are so many of us struggling with this very subject. We hope this is helpful.\n\n1. **What are a few ways alcoholism and addiction affect family members, loved ones, and spouses?**\n\nWhen someone in the family struggles with a substance use disorder, everyone struggles with it.  The most immediate factors are a break in the family traditions and a deep change in relationship that everyone in the family experiences with the person struggling. People struggling with SUDs tend to isolate themselves and often find it very difficult to engage in activities that may have long represented the structure of the family. Whether weekend activities or vacations, down to simple things like family dinners or garden projects, the person struggling becomes an unreliable partner. This can disrupt all of the family’s rituals while leading to conflict when others try to pull the person struggling back into the fold. This conflict comes to define the family, as the person struggling will often attempt to build alliances with some members of the family in defense of pressure from others. Moreover, the person struggling typically becomes untrustworthy, not showing up for obligations being just the first casualty. General dishonesty and even theft of things of value or cash become something against which everyone else in the house must guard. This drives further breakdown of relationships. Lastly, of course, there’s the fear felt by family members for the person struggling. It becomes clear that the person struggling is no longer the person everyone thought they knew. As use increases, typically so do dangerous behaviors by the person struggling. As family members become aware of these activities, often because of the consequences, the level of fear for the person struggling, life can become overwhelming.   \n\n1. **What can you do to protect your mental and emotional wellbeing if you are in a relationship with an addict or alcoholic?**\n\nIt sounds trite, but the best thing you can do to protect yourself is to do regular self-care. It’s extremely difficult to think about anything but your loved one who is in constant danger, but the journey of addiction is a marathon, not a sprint. You may miss the opportunity to provide the best support if you are “pouring from an empty cup”, as we say. This may mean taking breaks from talking about that person or things related to them. Designate a few hours a day that are “addiction-free” conversations.\n\n The second thing to do is to learn everything you can about the disease of addiction. Understand what is happening in your loved one’s brain. Read the science. Consult families who have been through the same thing you are experiencing. Talk to experts. You will discover that others who have been in your shoes have managed to make it to the other side of addiction. And while some have not, they will share invaluable lessons with you. Recovery from addiction, whether that is the loved ones affected by it, or the person experiencing it first-hand, is done with self-care, self-exploration, and community. As a family member, you must recover too.\n\n1. **Are there specific boundaries spouses, children, parents, and/or loved ones of addicts and alcoholics need to put up?**\n\nLike with most things, one size does not fit all. There is one general boundary that seems to work well in all relationships where there is dysfunction and addiction: “we will do everything to support your recovery and nothing to support your addiction.” This is no easy feat and can look different from family to family. For example, paying rent for one addict might be enabling and, for another, it might be getting them out of a traumatic circumstance. The general idea, however, is that the family puts all their efforts behind recovery-related progress. Addiction responds to consequences, not lectures or pleas for change. If it *consistently* is met with loving support for recovery, then the complete lack of support for addictive behaviors starts to weigh more heavily. Their behavior may not change right away, but I have seen this work in many families to get their loved ones well. \n\nAdditionally, it is vital that the family members not drop their entire lives to tend to the chaos of their loved ones. It is easy to do. All lives involved are reduced to waiting for the next emergency. There is no energy left for anything else. Find the time. Don’t let it slip between your fingers. If you give your addicted loved-one the opportunity to burn all your energy, they will take it. I call it the emotional vampire effect. Guard parts of your life that bring you joy. \n\n1. **What is the role of Al-Anon/Narc-Anon and what other resources are available to families of addicts/alcoholics?**\n\nAs a general statement, attending any mutual support groups available to families is a good idea. One large challenge family members face is shame and the stigma of having a family member who struggles with substances. Typically, peers who have not experienced substance use disorders in their family or their friends do not have the education necessary to know what is actually happening. Stereotypes regarding good parenting/bad parenting, lazy or hedonistic people who just need a swift kick in the butt to get going, versus an understanding of the mental health aspects of almost all substance use disorder cases, tend to dominate and be feared. Finding community with others who are experiencing the same thing in a safe place to speak one’s truths is very helpful in maintaining the family’s collective mental health. Everyone involved with substance use disorders needs to find out that they are not alone. This is the first toward healing. Whatever version/flavor of mutual support group makes sense for family members is important in maintaining the stability and stamina necessary to get through the ordeal to, hopefully, the recovery of the loved one who struggles with drugs and alcohol.",

Lastly, of course, there’s the fear felt by family members for the person struggling. It becomes clear that the person struggling is no longer the person everyone thought they knew. As use increases, typically so do dangerous behaviors by the person struggling. As family members become aware of these activities, often because of the consequences, the level of fear for the person struggling, life can become overwhelming.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to protect your mental and emotional wellbeing if you are in a relationship with an addict or alcoholic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds trite, but the best thing you can do to protect yourself is to do regular self-care. It’s extremely difficult to think about anything but your loved one who is in constant danger, but the journey of addiction is a marathon, not a sprint. You may miss the opportunity to provide the best support if you are “pouring from an empty cup”, as we say. This may mean taking breaks from talking about that person or things related to them. Designate a few hours a day that are “addiction-free” conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; The second thing to do is to learn everything you can about the disease of addiction. Understand what is happening in your loved one’s brain. Read the science. Consult families who have been through the same thing you are experiencing. Talk to experts. You will discover that others who have been in your shoes have managed to make it to the other side of addiction. And while some have not, they will share invaluable lessons with you. Recovery from addiction, whether that is the loved ones affected by it, or the person experiencing it first-hand, is done with self-care, self-exploration, and community. As a family member, you must recover too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there specific boundaries spouses, children, parents, and/or loved ones of addicts and alcoholics need to put up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like with most things, one size does not fit all. There is one general boundary that seems to work well in all relationships where there is dysfunction and addiction: “we will do everything to support your recovery and nothing to support your addiction.” This is no easy feat and can look different from family to family. For example, paying rent for one addict might be enabling and, for another, it might be getting them out of a traumatic circumstance. The general idea, however, is that the family puts all their efforts behind recovery-related progress. Addiction responds to consequences, not lectures or pleas for change. If it &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt; is met with loving support for recovery, then the complete lack of support for addictive behaviors starts to weigh more heavily. Their behavior may not change right away, but I have seen this work in many families to get their loved ones well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is vital that the family members not drop their entire lives to tend to the chaos of their loved ones. It is easy to do. All lives involved are reduced to waiting for the next emergency. There is no energy left for anything else. Find the time. Don’t let it slip between your fingers. If you give your addicted loved-one the opportunity to burn all your energy, they will take it. I call it the emotional vampire effect. Guard parts of your life that bring you joy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the role of Al-Anon/Narc-Anon and what other resources are available to families of addicts/alcoholics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a general statement, attending any mutual support groups available to families is a good idea. One large challenge family members face is shame and the stigma of having a family member who struggles with substances. Typically, peers who have not experienced substance use disorders in their family or their friends do not have the education necessary to know what is actually happening. Stereotypes regarding good parenting/bad parenting, lazy or hedonistic people who just need a swift kick in the butt to get going, versus an understanding of the mental health aspects of almost all substance use disorder cases, tend to dominate and be feared. Finding community with others who are experiencing the same thing in a safe place to speak one’s truths is very helpful in maintaining the family’s collective mental health. Everyone involved with substance use disorders needs to find out that they are not alone. This is the first toward healing. Whatever version/flavor of mutual support group makes sense for family members is important in maintaining the stability and stamina necessary to get through the ordeal to, hopefully, the recovery of the loved one who struggles with drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There must be something inside them that wants to do things differently ENOUGH that they are willing to try it out. We don't keep people in our program who do not want to be there. Now, there is a BIG difference between the people who think \"ugh, I wish I didn't have to do this but I need help\" and the ones that say, \"I do not want to be clean/sober - I do not want to be here\". No one comes into recovery on a winning streak. We come to recovery because the solution we were using stopped working and the pain of staying the same is GREATER than the pain of change. \n\nWe (Lionrock) do have a moderation management program called Health Balance. I am not sure if this is what you are referring to? \n\nHealth Balance is an interesting, and sometimes controversial, program that helps people to see if they are in the group of people that can moderate their usage (mostly alcohol). The program, however, requires a period of abstinence in the beginning before you introduce substances back into your life. If you cannot do a period of abstinence then it probably isn't going to work for you to moderate. I will check on the exact stats and come back and edit this post, but for the moment, I can tell you that it seems to be something like 60/40 with the people in this program. 60% of the people can make it work and about 40% have a problem that needs a higher level of care which likely does not include moderation. I think everyone who attends gets a lot out of the sessions, regardless of the outcome. Sometimes people need support in trying moderation to see that it doesn't work for them. Other people need support in moderation to see that they have underlying issues they need new coping skills for and this is how they get them. I've seen it go both ways. Successful moderation is also unique to each person because one person's goal may be very different from another's. We want to support people in creating and achieving their goals, not our goals for them. It kind of comes back to the original point I made which is that people must have a true desire to change in order to make it come to fruition. It can be a tiny, tiny spark of hope, but as long as there is something there... some desire... we can work with it. \n\nAs for what I think should be done for people who don't want to get clean, well, I think it really depends (ugh, I hate that answer). If you have a person under 18 who is killing themselves with drugs and alcohol, I suggest using that authority of parental rights to get them help. Consult with the experts on what is going on and what makes sense, and then get them help while you still can make that choice for them. If the person is over 18, depending on the situation, I highly recommend talking to people who do this work for a living and telling them the situation. They will help you navigate. I have helped many families put together an action plan for what to do with their loved ones. I have done everything from a full fledged intervention to some individual therapy and support groups. Because those of us who deal with addiction for a living deal with so many different scenarios, we are armed with a lot of tactics, language, resources, and skill when it comes to dealing with someone who is not in their right mind. There isn't a blanket treatment solution because, well, different strokes for different folks. If you had a massive plumbing issue in your home, you would call in a plumber. Why? Because that is what they do ALL DAY LONG. They deal with plumbing issues. They have lots of experience and have seen different things work or not work. They are your expert advisors. I always tell people - get an expert advisor to help you. There is no reason that you should know how to deal with substance and mental health disorders. Often times, what you think you are doing to help is making it worse. \n\nLionrock has a program for loved ones of someone struggling called Family Matters. It is all about coming up with a plan for your specific situation and offering you support/education around the disease of addiction (yep, it's a brain disease).\n\nLastly,  you do not always need to pay for this expertise. Often times you can call a treatment provider and they will give you options and opinions on what the next steps are going to be. Call a few of them. Call a trained interventionist. Talk to lots of people and see what they say. I am happy to help people who reach out. Don't do this alone.\n\nI hope this answered your questions :) Thanks for stopping by!",

We would explain to people what our company did and they LITERALLY did not understand until we showed them how it worked and brought them into a video-conference with us. As you can imagine, this made buy-in arduous. THEN, once people *did* understand, they said \"it would never work\". Oh man, if I had a nickel for every time I heard someone say that... People were not nice about it either. They were angry that we were trying something different. I have come to understand that this is normal if you are a disruptor in an industry, but at the time, it hurt. I was genuinely excited about offering something new in the space. \n\nThen we needed a Joint Commission Accreditation to be taken seriously by our peers; so we got one. Then people thought we were only good for rural clients. Then the insurance companies kept cutting the amount of money they reimburse for the same service that was costing us more and more as months passed. It's been a never-ending list of challenges. I am so grateful that we never gave up, even when we wanted to. In many ways, I attribute this to my other two co-founders. The three of us were in it together and whenever one of us was ready to give up, the other two were there to walk us through it. Had it been just one founder, I don't think we would have made it this far. We are a great team. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a lot of advantages now. COVID brought the entire treatment industry into the online space overnight. It was terrifying. We had a couple of meetings just looking at each other going, \"umm, what just happened?\"\n\nIt was also seamless for us while others were struggling. We have been scaling the company, so we didn't skip a beat when the number of clients in our program doubled. Continuity of care is so important and our clients have stayed on track, despite the world turning upside down. In addition to all this, we have been doing this for 10 years so we are experts at it! People who want a company that has proven themselves to be the leader in the space know who we are and respect what we have done with the company. It took a decade, but we got there.\n\nLastly, we are onto our new innovation. We knew this was coming and we were preparing for it.

That person should be someone who knows something about recovery - best of all someone in recovery - and can point you in the right direction while supporting your efforts along the way. \n\nIf you call Lionrock's 800.258.6550 number, you can speak with an admissions counselor (who knows a whole LOT about recovery and getting sober) about what the next steps need to be.

Without it, none of us are willing to make the changes necessary for a new life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, the first thing to do is pick up the phone and call someone to tell them you want help. That person should be someone who knows something about recovery - best of all someone in recovery - and can point you in the right direction while supporting your efforts along the way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you call Lionrock&amp;#39;s 800.258.6550 number, you can speak with an admissions counselor (who knows a whole LOT about recovery and getting sober) about what the next steps need to be. Even if you do not join our professional programs, we have free resources on our website and a Resources Specialist who works with people who do not have the funds for treatment to find other options. We are committed to helping any person who calls us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think eating disorders, sex &amp; porn addiction, gambling, love addiction etc. are super duper prevalent (especially in COVID times) and need discreet treatment options. At the moment, we help people deal with those struggles if they have substance abuse as a primary disorder (struggle). So, if you also have concerns about your drinking, you can work on sex/porn struggles with your primary counselor. We do not have a program specifically for sex/porn addiction (yet!). We ARE putting together gender specific trauma groups. We have several female ones and are assembling the male groups. This will likely be a consistent topic in the groups and a safe space to share about how to recover.\n\nSo, my complicated answer boils down to this: If you have substance abuse as an issue, we can help with your other issues.

She was a year younger than I am, and we are/were children of the 70's. We partied together plenty, but it was always different for her than it was for me. She took it to another level. When she was 24 and I was 25, I helped her find recovery from her addiction to heroin. I thought she was \"cured\". I didn't understand at the time that substance use disorders are generally self-medication of underlying anxiety. That anxiety can be caused by a range of issues, some organic, some experiential. When Ashley, my co-host here and oldest daughter, experienced the same kind of problems, I had no choice but to become better educated about substance use disorders and their treatment. In the summer of 2010 before she died, my sister was back in rehab again, and I was driving 90 minutes each way weekly to attend a 60 minute family session. I'd worked in Silicon Valley in technology for two decades and was using video conferencing every day. I wondered why video conferencing wasn't being employed in SUD treatment. I asked about it and was told \"it won't work\". When my sister died later that summer, we decided to join the fight and bring help to people struggling with SUDs online. What would be my one sentence? Substance problems are health problems, not moral problems, and recovery works if you choose it.",

Sean was in the podcast booth and he used the opportunity to tell me about a sexual assault that happened to him when he was 8 years old that he, as a man in his 40's, had NEVER told anyone about. I was floored. He was raw and deeply connected to me the entire time and I felt his trust in that moment so clearly. The episode was akin to a breakthrough therapy session, honestly. I was SO proud of him. The other episode that is in that same vein is Mike McAllister who also used the opportunity to come into the booth and do some growth work. He ended up having a realization during the podcast and making amends to someone who he had been afraid to contact for years. That type of stuff really moves me. I get so much out of hearing these stories and am truly grateful to be trusted by my guests.",
