Like anything that operates in the air, we are working in a highly regulated space and are very proud of our role driving the safety technologies that will underpin the wider eVTOL transport revolution in much the same way F1 has driven safety innovations for the motor car. This includes the development of collision avoidance tech which basically acts as virtual forcefields. This makes for super close but very safe racing. The circuits are also electronically governed to ensure pilots stay within the boundaries of the track. On the hardware side we have developed an exceptionally strong carbon-fibre monocoque to ensure the craft maintains structural integrity.   \n\n\nBut yes, Star Wars.",

Like anything that operates in the air, we are working in a highly regulated space and are very proud of our role driving the safety technologies that will underpin the wider eVTOL transport revolution in much the same way F1 has driven safety innovations for the motor car. This includes the development of collision avoidance tech which basically acts as virtual forcefields. This makes for super close but very safe racing. The circuits are also electronically governed to ensure pilots stay within the boundaries of the track. On the hardware side we have developed an exceptionally strong carbon-fibre monocoque to ensure the craft maintains structural integrity.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yes, Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
