If you're not tracking vocals or live instruments you could get away with a more basic software like Ableton. You can also use Logic and apply your money for purchase to plug-ins or synth software instead of an expensive DAW.",

Depends on who you are as an artist and how you've portrayed yourself, but I don't believe having your music placed commercially makes you a sell out. It's not like you're pushing somebody else's product. I used to write about 150 songs a year and maybe one would get placed while the rest were just practice. Quality, consistency, timing, it all plays a factor in growing your audience and landing those opportunities. Unless you're a big hitter, you have to be innovative with how you're getting your music in front of people.",

One the day after I arrived at a rehearsal space, one the day before the show at the arena, and one final dress rehearsal before doors opened. Everyone that put that show on was the most professional at what they did, and we were all very aware backstage what we were doing this for so everyone down to the people securing the venue were bringing their A-game. I felt like a fighter about to go out to earn my world title leading up to my call time. I paced around the soccer team's locker room doing vocal warm ups while my manager, best friend Earl, and fiance watched in angst until the producers grabbed me and walked me to the stage. At that point I was literally walking on air and felt more adrenaline pumping through me than I'd ever experienced. I was being told to watch my steps because of electrical and pyro going off, and had to not only perform but stay mindful of those cues and crucial moments. For example, I told the show producer before I went out, \"what if I ask the arena to raise their phones and sing the chant with me to close the song?\" and she had the brilliant idea seconds before I propelled through the floor to turn my camera flash on and face it towards my thigh so that it wouldn't show through my pants, but I would effortlessly be able to take the phone out and create the moment. Also, right before I went out I had people running up and yelling things in my ear left and right, but I managed to step aside and pray to Tim, to personally thank him, and to say I would do my best to perform as if he were on that stage behind me... It was one of those nights you find yourself walking around the hotel room at 3 AM still trying to come down from the rush, but not wanting the moment to pass. \n\nFav thing about Sweden was the FOOD!!! I could eat meatballs with ligonberries the entire time I am there haha.",

One the day after I arrived at a rehearsal space, one the day before the show at the arena, and one final dress rehearsal before doors opened. Everyone that put that show on was the most professional at what they did, and we were all very aware backstage what we were doing this for so everyone down to the people securing the venue were bringing their A-game. I felt like a fighter about to go out to earn my world title leading up to my call time. I paced around the soccer team's locker room doing vocal warm ups while my manager, best friend Earl, and fiance watched in angst until the producers grabbed me and walked me to the stage. At that point I was literally walking on air and felt more adrenaline pumping through me than I'd ever experienced. I was being told to watch my steps because of electrical and pyro going off, and had to not only perform but stay mindful of those cues and crucial moments. For example, I told the show producer before I went out, \"what if I ask the arena to raise their phones and sing the chant with me to close the song?\" and she had the brilliant idea seconds before I propelled through the floor to turn my camera flash on and face it towards my thigh so that it wouldn't show through my pants, but I would effortlessly be able to take the phone out and create the moment. Also, right before I went out I had people running up and yelling things in my ear left and right, but I managed to step aside and pray to Tim, to personally thank him, and to say I would do my best to perform as if he were on that stage behind me... It was one of those nights you find yourself walking around the hotel room at 3 AM still trying to come down from the rush, but not wanting the moment to pass. \n\nFav thing about Sweden was the FOOD!!! I could eat meatballs with ligonberries the entire time I am there haha.",
