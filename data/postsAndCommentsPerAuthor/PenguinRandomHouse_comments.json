When I first arrived with my family we shacked up with a distant aunt in a suburb of Toronto called Scarborough. At the time, Scarborough was being haunted by a particularly sadistic and horrible rapist - \"The Scarborough Rapist\" - and I would often hear the grown ups talking about this horrible man. Of course, I didn't know what \"rape\" was then, but I knew there was a monster out there hurting women, and everyone was telling my mother to watch out and stay vigilant.   \n\n\nWe moved from Scarborough to a small town at the edge of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) when I was about six. More or less forgot about the Scarborough rapist. Then, when I was nine or ten, he popped back up again and he had a name: Paul Bernardo. Turns out the \"Scarborough Rapist\" had graduated to being a serial killer. And a REALLY BAD one. Strangled at least three teenage girls to death. Videotaped repeated acts of rape. Had help from his wife Karla Homolka. The trauma those two stains inflicted on the collective psyche of southwestern, Ontario, and to some extent, Canada as a whole, has not gone away. It was THE serial killer story of my childhood, and I've written about it about four times - sometimes academically, sometimes for a popular audience. Teach the case to students and police. Know it inside out and top to bottom.  \n\n\nSo, it follows me around, but I wouldn't say it messed with me at all. It's just part of my history. Like a little 9/11. - LM",

There are widely different styles, conventions, and opinions regarding best practices in the true crime genre.   \n\n\nFor instance, the first true crime novels to really make a mark, *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote and *Helter Skelter* by Vincent Bugliosi, contain a great deal of fiction and details that the author couldn't possibly have known simply because they weren't a fly on the wall when the event actually happened. This can include dialogue attributed to real life \"characters\" which was never uttered, or at least not in the specific way it was written by the author.   \n\n\nThe journalistic approach is more objective, and therefore the writing is dryer, and in my opinion, far less gripping. It simply reports on what we know to be true and takes zero to minimal creative liberties. I personally don't consider this \"true crime\" more like \"factual crime\", and generally only mine these books for information on cases (though they can make tremendous resources). I rarely enjoy reading them, but it is certainly more ethical and less likely to get you sued.  \n\n\nAs far as the skills you need to cultivate: knowing how to file FOI requests, searching archives, online investigation techniques such as social network analysis etc. You also need to learn about the hurdles you will encounter along the way. Thus, taking an experienced crime writer out for a few drinks and getting them to open up about the BS they've had to deal with is an easy and useful way to know what to expect and prepare for it.  \n\n\nYou also need to be able to talk to a variety of different people, and put them at ease: cops, criminals, people who are full of crap and are eager to talk to you, people who are holding a dirty or dangerous secret and are (logically) reluctant or terrified of divulging it. So, how do you do this? It's hard to teach charisma, as it's somewhat innate. But you don't want to come at people with a cultivated persona or spewing an ideology. Be relaxed, as open as you can be, and fun to talk to (which includes a lot of listening), and people will open up to you. But don't contrive to be this way, you have to ACTUALLY be this way, which might mean changing your philosophy of social interactions. I've just kinda got it, and maybe you do or don't. It's just the best advice I can give you.   \n\n\nFinally, know psychology, criminology, history, biology, forensic sciences, and anthropology even if at a rudimentary level. You can collect as much data as you want from archives or interviews, but if you lack the knowledge and skills to contextualize and interpret it properly, you're gonna write garbage (though people might not necessarily notice). When in doubt consult experts - and avoid the phoney ones, plenty of them out there (some are big name celebrities btw) - and get them to bring their knowledge and experience to help inform or augment the information you've collected. Once again, if that costs you a few drinks or dinners, it's worth it in the grand scheme.   \nHope this helps. Good luck! - LM",

It's a cliche, but a useful one, to know that whenever we get safer we give up some chunk of our freedom or privacy. What isn't added on to this aphorism, but will be done here, thus making history, is that once a certain degree of freedom or privacy is lost, then we lose all of our safety, too. We are now under the complete control of the state or some similar institution.  \n\n\nSpecifically, with regards to DNA, I think it is profoundly unwise to make our genetic coding available to outside entities without an absolute guarantee that it will never be used outside that context (e.g., wanting to know who your ancestors were). Even then, I wouldn't give mine up. Why? Well, this opens us up to all kinds of abuses like the details of our DNA being divulged to potential employers, insurance companies, border security, intelligence agencies etc. that could negatively affect us in catastrophic ways. One of mankind's worst qualities is our short-sightedness and I believe this is what is happening regarding the support for allowing government actors to access DNA we have uploaded to a private company.   \n\n\nHowever, my opinion on the matter is completely worthless, because most other people will disagree with me, and we will sleepwalk into our own technologically abetted slavery, as we have time and again.

Well, this opens us up to all kinds of abuses like the details of our DNA being divulged to potential employers, insurance companies, border security, intelligence agencies etc. that could negatively affect us in catastrophic ways. One of mankind&amp;#39;s worst qualities is our short-sightedness and I believe this is what is happening regarding the support for allowing government actors to access DNA we have uploaded to a private company.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, my opinion on the matter is completely worthless, because most other people will disagree with me, and we will sleepwalk into our own technologically abetted slavery, as we have time and again. Have a good day ;) - LM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I saw a still, snowy setting with a big, empty dormitory before I even knew what Marin's journey would be. I'm very interested in anchors--in life and in fiction. What are the things that make you feel anchored? For me, it's often simple daily rituals and places. My morning coffee in my favorite mug. The view from my living room window. Taking a moment to sit on my back steps and look out over the city. . . These are the things that ground me. My new novel is very focused on these anchors, too, and very heavy on setting. Setting is so tied to atmosphere and mood and theme and character. I see setting as the craft element that holds all the others together, so I put a lot of intention behind it when I write. I have an episode on setting on my podcast Keeping a Notebook, actually! You could listen to that if you'd like some exercises and suggestions for your own work. &lt;3",

The setting for &lt;em&gt;We Are Okay&lt;/em&gt; is one of the first things that came to me when conceptualizing the book. I saw a still, snowy setting with a big, empty dormitory before I even knew what Marin&amp;#39;s journey would be. I&amp;#39;m very interested in anchors--in life and in fiction. What are the things that make you feel anchored? For me, it&amp;#39;s often simple daily rituals and places. My morning coffee in my favorite mug. The view from my living room window. Taking a moment to sit on my back steps and look out over the city. . . These are the things that ground me. My new novel is very focused on these anchors, too, and very heavy on setting. Setting is so tied to atmosphere and mood and theme and character. I see setting as the craft element that holds all the others together, so I put a lot of intention behind it when I write. I have an episode on setting on my podcast Keeping a Notebook, actually! You could listen to that if you&amp;#39;d like some exercises and suggestions for your own work. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I can tell you what I imagine for her, though, if you'd like! \n\nHere's how I see it: Marin accepts that she's now a part of Mabel's family. She has parents to lean on and to love. She is reluctant to accept their financial help--that will probably never change--but she does accept their love and stay in close touch with them. She's independent. She learns to make ceramics and becomes integral to the studio. She stays in New York but she does go back to San Francisco for some holidays. She and Mabel don't get back together. It gets easier for them as years pass, but even in their future closeness, there will always be loss between them. I see a bright future for Marin, one that comes out of very deep sadness but that shapes her into a strong and loving person who fosters secure relationships and leads a beautiful life. I think she learns to love reading again.",

I don&amp;#39;t see myself writing a sequel to &lt;em&gt;We Are Okay&lt;/em&gt; but it&amp;#39;s difficult for me to let go of Marin, too. She became very real to me. I can tell you what I imagine for her, though, if you&amp;#39;d like! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I see it: Marin accepts that she&amp;#39;s now a part of Mabel&amp;#39;s family. She has parents to lean on and to love. She is reluctant to accept their financial help--that will probably never change--but she does accept their love and stay in close touch with them. She&amp;#39;s independent. She learns to make ceramics and becomes integral to the studio. She stays in New York but she does go back to San Francisco for some holidays. She and Mabel don&amp;#39;t get back together. It gets easier for them as years pass, but even in their future closeness, there will always be loss between them. I see a bright future for Marin, one that comes out of very deep sadness but that shapes her into a strong and loving person who fosters secure relationships and leads a beautiful life. I think she learns to love reading again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

As far as unappreciated, I'll just go with obscure, which is The Castle of Otranto. It's the book that kicked off the genre.

Again, before doing anything, read over everything you have all the way through, trying not to judge or edit it, just to get the feel of the thing back in your mind. 2. Find a book that inspires that kind of writing in you. I call this my \"desk book\" but other writers call it different things. When I was writing a great depression era novel I kept Grapes of Wrath near my desk to read a page or two from before writing. This reminded me of the tone and the era I was going for and got me back in the mood. 3. I don't believe you need to start completely fresh, but definitely retype with your old manuscript next to you rather than trying to tinker in the old document. It's so much more freeing and allows you to make big changes and try new things as you transcribe. The old document will always be there if you end up not liking the new revision!",

When you look out toward sharing your writing with the world it is often helpful to think of a specific audience member you want to reach, even if it is you as a child, to take your practice from private to public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the actual writing part of it, shift your perspective (literally) with the pieces in your notebook, by rewriting them in a new way. Type them if they are handwritten and vice versa. Then, when you have a draft, you might consider joining a workshop. This will open your eyes to the world of writing for others. Good luck and have fun!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Later on when you have more time to work on a project you might like to play the recording for yourself at your writing desk. I do this some times when my ideas are running away from me. Not only do I then preserve the content, but the emotion behind the idea, and I can use the recording as a prompt to return me to that headspace when it’s time to go to work again. \n\nThe first issue I picked up on, which is of actually finishing a piece, is very common, and a big reason why one of Words In Progress’s seven sections is dedicated to “Finding the End.” As I always say and mention in the book, catching an idea is a bit like falling in love—it’s so exciting and enticing (which is why new ideas sometimes come and sweep us off our feet before we can finish the first project). Finishing a piece of writing is a bit like maintaining a relationship. It’s a bit more work, but the rewards run deep. Even if you don’t end up recording yourself, read over what you have already written to get the feel of it in your bones again before moving forward and try some simple prompts to trick yourself over the finish line, like choosing a random image or line in a poem to aim for as the last scene or feeling in your piece.

I would also recommend Patient Services to do a lot of outreach to the disability community about accessibility and accommodations AND for actual responsiveness &amp; accountability when requests or complaints are made. It sucks, but sometimes disabled people who encounter barriers and try to work on finding a resolution have no recourse except for legal action because institutions do not comply with the ADA and other laws.

My basic message is this: If a company is not publicly traded, it does not need to become a B corp to prioritize social and environmental goals over profits. If it is publicly-traded, it must prioritize profits. Now, importantly, cases like BCE and the ESG movement effectively encourage corporations to find win-win solutions that serve both shareholders and social values, to pursue long-term goals rather than short-term profits and boosts to share prices, and even to slightly sacrifice performance and financial goals for the sake of social values. But the problem is that shareholders will always expect a return - that's why they invest. They will never say, \"here take our money and do good with it, don't worry about returning anything to us.\" That's not the nature of our system. The fact is investors won't invest in companies that pursue social and environmental goals at the expense of shareholder interests, regardless of tweaks to the law, or corporate form, or B-corp designations, or whatever. That's a profound limit on how much good, and how little bad, corporations can do. Add to that the fact corporations are not in any way democratically accountable to anyone but their shareholders, and the case for relying on corporations to do good and not do bad - even with B-corps, ESG, BCE, and whatever else - is weak.",

More or less forgot about the Scarborough rapist. Then, when I was nine or ten, he popped back up again and he had a name: Paul Bernardo. Turns out the \"Scarborough Rapist\" had graduated to being a serial killer. And a REALLY BAD one. Strangled at least three teenage girls to death. Videotaped repeated acts of rape. Had help from his wife Karla Homolka. The trauma those two stains inflicted on the collective psyche of southwestern, Ontario, and to some extent, Canada as a whole, has not gone away. It was THE serial killer story of my childhood, and I've written about it about four times - sometimes academically, sometimes for a popular audience. Teach the case to students and police.

        "body": "Maureen: The abduction, murder, and recovery of Samantha Koenig, for many reasons: Contrary to the Bureau's official narrative, Koening had been seen alive with Keyes at least 13 times, by different witnesses, from the moment he abducted her, and she was out and alive in public for hours. Her station in life — poor, daughter of rumored Hell's Angel, struggles with substances — didn't make her as high priority for abduction as, say, a wealthy blond girl.

There are widely different styles, conventions, and opinions regarding best practices in the true crime genre.   \n\n\nFor instance, the first true crime novels to really make a mark, *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote and *Helter Skelter* by Vincent Bugliosi, contain a great deal of fiction and details that the author couldn't possibly have known simply because they weren't a fly on the wall when the event actually happened. This can include dialogue attributed to real life \"characters\" which was never uttered, or at least not in the specific way it was written by the author.   \n\n\nThe journalistic approach is more objective, and therefore the writing is dryer, and in my opinion, far less gripping. It simply reports on what we know to be true and takes zero to minimal creative liberties. I personally don't consider this \"true crime\" more like \"factual crime\", and generally only mine these books for information on cases (though they can make tremendous resources). I rarely enjoy reading them, but it is certainly more ethical and less likely to get you sued.  \n\n\nAs far as the skills you need to cultivate: knowing how to file FOI requests, searching archives, online investigation techniques such as social network analysis etc. You also need to learn about the hurdles you will encounter along the way. Thus, taking an experienced crime writer out for a few drinks and getting them to open up about the BS they've had to deal with is an easy and useful way to know what to expect and prepare for it.  \n\n\nYou also need to be able to talk to a variety of different people, and put them at ease: cops, criminals, people who are full of crap and are eager to talk to you, people who are holding a dirty or dangerous secret and are (logically) reluctant or terrified of divulging it. So, how do you do this? It's hard to teach charisma, as it's somewhat innate. But you don't want to come at people with a cultivated persona or spewing an ideology. Be relaxed, as open as you can be, and fun to talk to (which includes a lot of listening), and people will open up to you. But don't contrive to be this way, you have to ACTUALLY be this way, which might mean changing your philosophy of social interactions. I've just kinda got it, and maybe you do or don't. It's just the best advice I can give you.   \n\n\nFinally, know psychology, criminology, history, biology, forensic sciences, and anthropology even if at a rudimentary level. You can collect as much data as you want from archives or interviews, but if you lack the knowledge and skills to contextualize and interpret it properly, you're gonna write garbage (though people might not necessarily notice). When in doubt consult experts - and avoid the phoney ones, plenty of them out there (some are big name celebrities btw) - and get them to bring their knowledge and experience to help inform or augment the information you've collected. Once again, if that costs you a few drinks or dinners, it's worth it in the grand scheme.   \nHope this helps. Good luck! - LM",

Have a good day ;) - LM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So, I am not \"freaked out\" or \"stressed\" by thoughts of violent crime whatsoever. I accept them as an inseparable part of the human condition and something I may or may not have to deal with. But some horror is headed my way, and I think it's important to come to terms with that in order to not be paralyzed by fear.

I saw a still, snowy setting with a big, empty dormitory before I even knew what Marin's journey would be. I'm very interested in anchors--in life and in fiction. What are the things that make you feel anchored? For me, it's often simple daily rituals and places. My morning coffee in my favorite mug. The view from my living room window. Taking a moment to sit on my back steps and look out over the city. . . These are the things that ground me. My new novel is very focused on these anchors, too, and very heavy on setting. Setting is so tied to atmosphere and mood and theme and character. I see setting as the craft element that holds all the others together, so I put a lot of intention behind it when I write. I have an episode on setting on my podcast Keeping a Notebook, actually! You could listen to that if you'd like some exercises and suggestions for your own work. &lt;3",

What are the things that make you feel anchored? For me, it&amp;#39;s often simple daily rituals and places. My morning coffee in my favorite mug. The view from my living room window. Taking a moment to sit on my back steps and look out over the city. . . These are the things that ground me. My new novel is very focused on these anchors, too, and very heavy on setting. Setting is so tied to atmosphere and mood and theme and character. I see setting as the craft element that holds all the others together, so I put a lot of intention behind it when I write. I have an episode on setting on my podcast Keeping a Notebook, actually! You could listen to that if you&amp;#39;d like some exercises and suggestions for your own work. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I can tell you what I imagine for her, though, if you'd like! \n\nHere's how I see it: Marin accepts that she's now a part of Mabel's family. She has parents to lean on and to love. She is reluctant to accept their financial help--that will probably never change--but she does accept their love and stay in close touch with them. She's independent. She learns to make ceramics and becomes integral to the studio. She stays in New York but she does go back to San Francisco for some holidays. She and Mabel don't get back together. It gets easier for them as years pass, but even in their future closeness, there will always be loss between them. I see a bright future for Marin, one that comes out of very deep sadness but that shapes her into a strong and loving person who fosters secure relationships and leads a beautiful life. I think she learns to love reading again.",

I don&amp;#39;t see myself writing a sequel to &lt;em&gt;We Are Okay&lt;/em&gt; but it&amp;#39;s difficult for me to let go of Marin, too. She became very real to me. I can tell you what I imagine for her, though, if you&amp;#39;d like! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I see it: Marin accepts that she&amp;#39;s now a part of Mabel&amp;#39;s family. She has parents to lean on and to love. She is reluctant to accept their financial help--that will probably never change--but she does accept their love and stay in close touch with them. She&amp;#39;s independent. She learns to make ceramics and becomes integral to the studio. She stays in New York but she does go back to San Francisco for some holidays. She and Mabel don&amp;#39;t get back together. It gets easier for them as years pass, but even in their future closeness, there will always be loss between them. I see a bright future for Marin, one that comes out of very deep sadness but that shapes her into a strong and loving person who fosters secure relationships and leads a beautiful life. I think she learns to love reading again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

As far as unappreciated, I'll just go with obscure, which is The Castle of Otranto. It's the book that kicked off the genre.

Again, before doing anything, read over everything you have all the way through, trying not to judge or edit it, just to get the feel of the thing back in your mind. 2. Find a book that inspires that kind of writing in you. I call this my \"desk book\" but other writers call it different things. When I was writing a great depression era novel I kept Grapes of Wrath near my desk to read a page or two from before writing. This reminded me of the tone and the era I was going for and got me back in the mood. 3. I don't believe you need to start completely fresh, but definitely retype with your old manuscript next to you rather than trying to tinker in the old document. It's so much more freeing and allows you to make big changes and try new things as you transcribe. The old document will always be there if you end up not liking the new revision!",

When you look out toward sharing your writing with the world it is often helpful to think of a specific audience member you want to reach, even if it is you as a child, to take your practice from private to public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the actual writing part of it, shift your perspective (literally) with the pieces in your notebook, by rewriting them in a new way. Type them if they are handwritten and vice versa. Then, when you have a draft, you might consider joining a workshop. This will open your eyes to the world of writing for others. Good luck and have fun!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Later on when you have more time to work on a project you might like to play the recording for yourself at your writing desk. I do this some times when my ideas are running away from me. Not only do I then preserve the content, but the emotion behind the idea, and I can use the recording as a prompt to return me to that headspace when it’s time to go to work again. \n\nThe first issue I picked up on, which is of actually finishing a piece, is very common, and a big reason why one of Words In Progress’s seven sections is dedicated to “Finding the End.” As I always say and mention in the book, catching an idea is a bit like falling in love—it’s so exciting and enticing (which is why new ideas sometimes come and sweep us off our feet before we can finish the first project). Finishing a piece of writing is a bit like maintaining a relationship. It’s a bit more work, but the rewards run deep. Even if you don’t end up recording yourself, read over what you have already written to get the feel of it in your bones again before moving forward and try some simple prompts to trick yourself over the finish line, like choosing a random image or line in a poem to aim for as the last scene or feeling in your piece.

I would also recommend Patient Services to do a lot of outreach to the disability community about accessibility and accommodations AND for actual responsiveness &amp; accountability when requests or complaints are made. It sucks, but sometimes disabled people who encounter barriers and try to work on finding a resolution have no recourse except for legal action because institutions do not comply with the ADA and other laws.

My basic message is this: If a company is not publicly traded, it does not need to become a B corp to prioritize social and environmental goals over profits. If it is publicly-traded, it must prioritize profits. Now, importantly, cases like BCE and the ESG movement effectively encourage corporations to find win-win solutions that serve both shareholders and social values, to pursue long-term goals rather than short-term profits and boosts to share prices, and even to slightly sacrifice performance and financial goals for the sake of social values. But the problem is that shareholders will always expect a return - that's why they invest. They will never say, \"here take our money and do good with it, don't worry about returning anything to us.\" That's not the nature of our system. The fact is investors won't invest in companies that pursue social and environmental goals at the expense of shareholder interests, regardless of tweaks to the law, or corporate form, or B-corp designations, or whatever. That's a profound limit on how much good, and how little bad, corporations can do. Add to that the fact corporations are not in any way democratically accountable to anyone but their shareholders, and the case for relying on corporations to do good and not do bad - even with B-corps, ESG, BCE, and whatever else - is weak.",

There are beautiful ads by Bank of Nova Scotia about the eventual return to hockey normalcy. Really moving. And then, in yesterday&amp;#39;s paper, the headline is about that banks fraudulent criminality. Where you do see some genuine movement towards socially conscious business, on both sides of the border, is in small businesses, ones that are not publicly-traded and thereby have leeway to determine how they want to balance profits with social and environmental goods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I was delighted that the publisher released the e-book, audiobook, and paperback at the same time so that readers have options. And it was important to me to add as much complementary materials with the book that can open up discussion and access even further. I learned a lot from disabled people who use plain language on how this is an access issue that's often overlooked so I hired autistic writer/journalist Sara Luterman to write the plain language version and writer Naomi Ortiz to write the discussion guide. I wanted as many free things to go with the book. If you check out my website, I recently added an infographic too! I do not know for sure if my book is the first to do all of this but I hope it encourages other writers to do the same! https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/book/",

As a man, I would definitely explore and reflect on the role of masculinity in keeping men from being open about their mental health. It&amp;#39;s an unfortunate American value that we prize &amp;#39;strength&amp;#39; and that we don&amp;#39;t associate strength with vulnerability and asking or needing help. We&amp;#39;re all interdependent and that&amp;#39;s what makes us stronger as individuals and as a community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I would always feel this male presence standing over my shoulder when I sat at her kitchen table. Once, I was falling asleep on her couch and looked into the kitchen and for a second I thought I saw a man standing there. After a summer of experiences like this without saying anything because I thought I would sound crazy, I finally said to her, \"You know you have a ghost, right?\" and she said \"Oh, yeah, the man who stands in my door.

If you are a beginner, I’d suggest reading everything you can to get a good feel for pacing, plot development, and what you like about a character. Don’t read the free books of other beginners. Read the books from authors you want to emulate. They have the skills you want.\n\nAnd then write, write, write to see if writing is something you are physically and mentally able to do. It’s hard, and not for everyone. Don’t feel bad if you find it isn’t for you. There are lots of different ways to tell a story. Video, plays, drawing, sculpture, poetry: they all are disciplined, but each pulls on different strengths. Find where your strength is and go!\n\nGood luck!",

He was too afraid to admit to the rest of the demons, much less to himself, that he loved her, and it tore him up.

Love. When he left that cocoon crushed in Trent’s garden, it just about killed me–until the end when I saw the blue butterflies again and knew that he was again…whole.",

The line was different when I first started writing. I think it’s looser now, thanks to mainstream fantasy outlets like the SF channel and the many, many fantasy movies and shows that are, and this is important, making producers enough money to be attractive. So thank you, consumers of fantasy! You let me do what I love.\n\nI don’t think you need worry about losing the reader from disbelief as long as the character is real, as in having real problems, real joys, and coping with real downsides to the magic he or she does. But you’re right that you don’t want to give them too much power. If you have to for the story to work, take that power away before the book ends. Regret for loss is a great way to connect to your audience. We all lose stuff, people, abilities.\n\nI’m glad you see that rules are important. I'm always overcomplicating it. The simpler the better. Less is more. And follow your gut instinct. If you think it’s too much, back it off. You can always add that magical ability in book two.\n\nGood luck with your work, and happy writing!",

Before I go much farther, I’d like to reassure you that I have yet to meet the editor or publisher who doesn’t want to find that manuscript that sparkles and speaks to them, that captivates and takes them somewhere they’ve not been before with people they love to hate, or just plain love.\n\nTrouble is, most of them can see in two pages if your work has the chops to give it to them, and from that, I mean, does your style show immediately, are your sentences interesting to read, do they flow or are they chunky? (and if they do, is there a reason for it?) Is there variety in how your thoughts are put on the paper? Word choice, dialog, and the idea they carry are all mixed up in a glorious slurry, and it usually takes a long time to find your literary voice to do it successfully. Don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t have it yet. It takes a long, long time. Multiple manuscripts long. So my advice is to just…write. Keep writing. Keep sharing. Keep adding tools to your toolbox and friends to your circle who can help you suffer through this until you get there. Best advice I can give is to write. Sometimes it’s that simple, and that hard.",

You can start with the trope, but then dig deeper or push it further into areas you haven't seen before.\n\nFine, a young knight gets his father's longsword and wants to be a great knight too. \\*yawn\\* What if we find out that his Dad wasn't a hero, or a legend, or even a human? What if that sword isn't just a magic blade but actually something far more sinister? Maybe really growing up is about rejecting the legacy you thought you were supposed to have and being an adult isn't about being like your parents, but forging your own path?\n\nThat's a really quick brainstorm right here based on well worn tropes.

There still has to be heart at the core of it. Character stories have to come first. You can start with the trope, but then dig deeper or push it further into areas you haven&amp;#39;t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fine, a young knight gets his father&amp;#39;s longsword and wants to be a great knight too. *yawn* What if we find out that his Dad wasn&amp;#39;t a hero, or a legend, or even a human? What if that sword isn&amp;#39;t just a magic blade but actually something far more sinister? Maybe really growing up is about rejecting the legacy you thought you were supposed to have and being an adult isn&amp;#39;t about being like your parents, but forging your own path?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a really quick brainstorm right here based on well worn tropes.

You can love something and not work hard at it. You need to devote your soul to that career choice. On my first date with my now wife, I left early to get back to work. If it&amp;#39;s what you want, don&amp;#39;t half-ass it. I&amp;#39;m not a great writer or cartoonist, what I am is passionate. I work hard at whatever little talent I have and never give up. If you can do that, you&amp;#39;ll have a career. And, my career is just as stable if not more than many.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
