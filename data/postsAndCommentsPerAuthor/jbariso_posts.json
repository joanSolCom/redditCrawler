I'll be checking this thread periodically so please feel free to continue to post questions as long as Reddit allows and I'll respond as I'm able. So long!\\]\n\nHey Reddit,\n\nI’m Justin Bariso, and I show people what emotional intelligence, a pretty abstract concept, looks like in real life. I write a [weekly column for Inc.com,](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/13-things-emotionally-intelligent-people-do.html) and I authored a book called “EQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence,” which has been translated into over a dozen languages.\n\nHere are some of my most popular Inc. articles (some repub'd on my personal blog):\n\n* [Krispy Kreme Ordered a Student to Stop Reselling Its Doughnuts. His Response Is a Master Class in Emotional Intelligence](https://www.eqapplied.com/eq-news/how-a-college-student-reselling-krispy-kreme-doughnuts-lead-to-a-major-lesson-in-emotional-intelligence)\n* [Why Intelligent Minds Like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs Embrace the Rule of Awkward Silence](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/why-intelligent-minds-like-elon-musk-steve-jobs-embrace-rule-of-awkward-silence.html)\n* ['Spider-Man' Star Tom Holland's Response to Kirsten Dunst Is a Lesson in Emotional Intelligence](https://www.eqapplied.com/eq-news/spider-man-star-tom-hollands-response-to-kirsten-dunst-is-absolutely-perfect)\n* [Wendy's Insulted McDonald's Breakfast Over Twitter.

It Came Up With These 10 Things](https://www.eqapplied.com/career/n64hxq0hx2k28y88vru4bsvbx9wjeb)\n\nAnd this article used to show up as the number one search result when you typed “emotional intelligence” into Google (it’s currently still in the top five):\n\n[13 Signs of High Emotional Intelligence](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/13-things-emotionally-intelligent-people-do.html)\n\nI’ve also had some pretty interesting experiences over the years. Trying to understand and process emotions has helped me:\n\n* Build a successful business after suffering a year of unemployment\n* Move to another country and learn two languages\n* Convince the girl of my dreams to marry me (after she initially wouldn’t give me the time of day)\n* Enjoy a happy marriage to said girl of my dreams for over a decade\n* Try to raise three kids with the girl of my dreams without going crazy\n* Connect with brilliant business minds and CEOs, including former FBI negotiations expert Chris Voss and Shark Tank investor Barbara Corcoran\n\nI consider myself a student, not an expert—but I’m looking forward to sharing what I’ve learned…and I look forward to learning from you all, too!\n\nBefore we get started, huge thanks to the IAmA mods (esp. JT!) for helping me, and...\n\n[Here’s my proof...](https://twitter.com/JustinJBariso/status/1280184198276530181?s=20)\n\nOk, Reddit. Let’s do this.
