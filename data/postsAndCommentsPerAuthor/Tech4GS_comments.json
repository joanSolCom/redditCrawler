        "body": "Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the points at which Internet networks interconnect with each other. To understand why they’re so important economically, you have to think through the model of traffic exchange, and ask yourself a question. When you send a packet somewhere, you’re a customer of an ISP, and the person you’re sending it to is a customer of a different ISP, and the ISPs interconnect with each other.  It can be more complicated than that, but ultimately, that’s the model that it reduces down to. You pay your ISP for the service of delivering bandwidth to you.  Your correspondent pays their ISP for delivering bandwidth to them. If your ISP and their ISP did not interconnect, would you be receiving the service you’re paying for?  Would you have any reason to pay your ISP? \n\nSo, the source of the bandwidth, the source of the value for which you’re paying, is the point of interconnection between the ISPs, not within one ISP or the other.  If it were within your ISP, the other ISP would pay your ISP.  If it were within the other ISP, your ISP would pay their ISP.  If it were somehow within both ISPs, then you’d both still be receiving value and paying for it, even if the ISPs didn’t interconnect with each other. But none of those things are the case.  If they aren’t connected with each other, there’s no value created, and you don’t receive service, and you don’t have reason to pay for it. So, IXPs are the factories that produce Internet bandwidth.  ISPs carry that bandwidth from IXPs to users, and deliver it to the users at the location where the user wishes to consume it, whether that’s a home or an office or a school or a mobile phone on a moving train. Each IXP has a certain capacity, headroom beyond its current production, just as each ISP has a certain capacity, and each circuit has a certain capacity. By and large, we’re nowhere near pushing the capacity limits of IXPs.  IXPs are cheap to build and operate, so they’re almost never the bottleneck. Speed times distance equals cost, in Internet bandwidth transport, as in many other things. So, the closer users are to the IXPs that are producing their bandwidth (and it’s always a blended mix from many different IXPs, not just a single source), the faster and cheaper it is. Because of the funny way the Internet works, IXPs are generating bandwidth in response to demand. Until someone actually transmits a packet, what the IXP has is just latent capacity.  It’s as though a factory produced a good just-in-time, for each order.  Kinda like Tesla, that way, actually. So IXPs have to be built in advance of demand, with latent capacity.  Then ISPs connect to them, and start using BGP to exchange routes through them.  As soon as routes are advertised through an IXP, bandwidth will begin to be produced to accommodate traffic between users downstream from those connected ISPs. It takes two to tango.  If there’s only a single ISP connected to an IXP, there’s nobody for their customers to exchange traffic with, and no bandwidth is produced, no value is produced, and no fraction of the value that the users are paying for will come from that IXP. Likewise, if ISPs connect to an IXP and don’t choose to exchange routes through BGP-speaking routers, no bandwidth is produced. But, if everything is up and running properly, as financial incentives dictate, IXPs will produce as much bandwidth as users want to consume, and any bottlenecks are in the ISPs transporting the bandwidth to the users. But speed x distance = cost, so IXPs local to users are always an ISP’s cheapest source of bandwidth to supply those users, so their cheapest alternative is to upgrade those circuits to remove the bottlenecks, so users won’t be incentivized to turn elsewhere to meet their needs, at lower margin (or even loss) for the ISP. So IXPs aren’t a problem area. ISPs being able to get to IXPs and do upgrades as necessary can be a problem right now, particularly when they need to take equipment and supplies to the IXP to perform the upgrade.  There are travel lockdowns, people have to look after their kids because schools are closed, and it’s getting harder and harder to pull necessary parts and equipment through the global supply-chain to the places where it’s needed. And Trump is still conducting his idiotic one-man trade-war with China, which we’re all paying for.",

In theory, communications and privacy and security regulators should have experts on staff, and should investigate things like this, and should have the power to compel reasonable behavior.

Not the security-theater part of it, of course, and not the part where aircraft manufacturers pay off regulators to look the other way on bad design. But the part where people who have problems are encouraged to come forward and help investigators determine root causes, with a hard firewall between that, and liability, is excellent policy. \n\nAnd tough punishment for purposeful bad-acting which leads to public harm, even when that specific type of bad-acting wasn’t specifically regulated against in advance…  That means that people have to behave responsibly and judiciously, with an eye to the safety of others, rather than just winging it like batshit sociopathic libertarian techbros, trying to turn themselves into unicorns at the expense of whoever happens to be easiest to victimize.

        "body": "I’m Quad9's board chair, so not the best person to answer detailed questions about the traffic patterns seen there, but I’ll try to answer in general, and can follow up with more specifics if needed. \n\nQuad9 is very different than most other public resolvers, for a variety of reasons.  First, it’s a public-benefit non-profit, that’s funded by donations.  So there’s no financial model to sell data, therefore no reason to collect data, therefore no reason to architect the entire thing to maximize the amount of data to be collected. Thus we look a lot different than some of the other recursive resolvers, and the profile of our users is a lot different than those of other recursive resolvers, because we *actively encourage them to protect their privacy*.  That means to use best practices to protect themselves, and not to just blindly trust us.  So that means that many of them (most of the ones who talk with us, anyway) are running their own caching resolvers, and performing query-minimization. A lot of them are also fairly aware of their security and privacy, and have been since long before the DoH scam…  so they’re using DoT, rather than DoH, by and large.\n\nWe do see DoH traffic, and we try to be agnostic and support all protocols which might make things better.DoH isn’t a substantially worse protocol in and of itself, than DoT, but there’s a huge difference in the politics of the people implementing and using the two. And there’s a huge amount of money being spent to convince people that DoH is, in itself, somehow beneficial, so that people won’t look behind the curtain and think about who holds the decryption key for the other end of the DoH transaction, and won’t think about how much of their personal information they’re shoveling across that DoH link.  And thus won’t think about who the DoH encryption benefits. Again, there’s the problem with Net Neutrality and using DNS “given away for free” by a company that’s actually in the business of selling content and user data. Yes, they want you to encrypt your link to them, so that no one else can see your traffic, and they’ll have a monopoly on selling it. Which isn’t exactly the reason they’re touting. \n\nAnyway... \n\nYes, Quad9 sees folks using DoH.  Some of those are Mozilla users, many more are Chrome users. But Quad9 (and I) would strongly recommend that you pay more attention to who you’re sending your Internet-use metadata to and how much you’re sending them, and stick with DoT rather than following the DoH flavor-of-the-day into a back alley where you’re going to get mugged for your click-trail data.",

Thus we look a lot different than some of the other recursive resolvers, and the profile of our users is a lot different than those of other recursive resolvers, because we &lt;em&gt;actively encourage them to protect their privacy&lt;/em&gt;.  That means to use best practices to protect themselves, and not to just blindly trust us.  So that means that many of them (most of the ones who talk with us, anyway) are running their own caching resolvers, and performing query-minimization. A lot of them are also fairly aware of their security and privacy, and have been since long before the DoH scam…  so they’re using DoT, rather than DoH, by and large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do see DoH traffic, and we try to be agnostic and support all protocols which might make things better.DoH isn’t a substantially worse protocol in and of itself, than DoT, but there’s a huge difference in the politics of the people implementing and using the two. And there’s a huge amount of money being spent to convince people that DoH is, in itself, somehow beneficial, so that people won’t look behind the curtain and think about who holds the decryption key for the other end of the DoH transaction, and won’t think about how much of their personal information they’re shoveling across that DoH link.  And thus won’t think about who the DoH encryption benefits. Again, there’s the problem with Net Neutrality and using DNS “given away for free” by a company that’s actually in the business of selling content and user data. Yes, they want you to encrypt your link to them, so that no one else can see your traffic, and they’ll have a monopoly on selling it. Which isn’t exactly the reason they’re touting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Quad9 sees folks using DoH.  Some of those are Mozilla users, many more are Chrome users. But Quad9 (and I) would strongly recommend that you pay more attention to who you’re sending your Internet-use metadata to and how much you’re sending them, and stick with DoT rather than following the DoH flavor-of-the-day into a back alley where you’re going to get mugged for your click-trail data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the points at which Internet networks interconnect with each other. To understand why they’re so important economically, you have to think through the model of traffic exchange, and ask yourself a question. When you send a packet somewhere, you’re a customer of an ISP, and the person you’re sending it to is a customer of a different ISP, and the ISPs interconnect with each other.  It can be more complicated than that, but ultimately, that’s the model that it reduces down to. You pay your ISP for the service of delivering bandwidth to you.  Your correspondent pays their ISP for delivering bandwidth to them. If your ISP and their ISP did not interconnect, would you be receiving the service you’re paying for?  Would you have any reason to pay your ISP? \n\nSo, the source of the bandwidth, the source of the value for which you’re paying, is the point of interconnection between the ISPs, not within one ISP or the other.  If it were within your ISP, the other ISP would pay your ISP.  If it were within the other ISP, your ISP would pay their ISP.  If it were somehow within both ISPs, then you’d both still be receiving value and paying for it, even if the ISPs didn’t interconnect with each other. But none of those things are the case.  If they aren’t connected with each other, there’s no value created, and you don’t receive service, and you don’t have reason to pay for it. So, IXPs are the factories that produce Internet bandwidth.  ISPs carry that bandwidth from IXPs to users, and deliver it to the users at the location where the user wishes to consume it, whether that’s a home or an office or a school or a mobile phone on a moving train. Each IXP has a certain capacity, headroom beyond its current production, just as each ISP has a certain capacity, and each circuit has a certain capacity. By and large, we’re nowhere near pushing the capacity limits of IXPs.  IXPs are cheap to build and operate, so they’re almost never the bottleneck. Speed times distance equals cost, in Internet bandwidth transport, as in many other things. So, the closer users are to the IXPs that are producing their bandwidth (and it’s always a blended mix from many different IXPs, not just a single source), the faster and cheaper it is. Because of the funny way the Internet works, IXPs are generating bandwidth in response to demand. Until someone actually transmits a packet, what the IXP has is just latent capacity.  It’s as though a factory produced a good just-in-time, for each order.  Kinda like Tesla, that way, actually. So IXPs have to be built in advance of demand, with latent capacity.  Then ISPs connect to them, and start using BGP to exchange routes through them.  As soon as routes are advertised through an IXP, bandwidth will begin to be produced to accommodate traffic between users downstream from those connected ISPs. It takes two to tango.  If there’s only a single ISP connected to an IXP, there’s nobody for their customers to exchange traffic with, and no bandwidth is produced, no value is produced, and no fraction of the value that the users are paying for will come from that IXP. Likewise, if ISPs connect to an IXP and don’t choose to exchange routes through BGP-speaking routers, no bandwidth is produced. But, if everything is up and running properly, as financial incentives dictate, IXPs will produce as much bandwidth as users want to consume, and any bottlenecks are in the ISPs transporting the bandwidth to the users. But speed x distance = cost, so IXPs local to users are always an ISP’s cheapest source of bandwidth to supply those users, so their cheapest alternative is to upgrade those circuits to remove the bottlenecks, so users won’t be incentivized to turn elsewhere to meet their needs, at lower margin (or even loss) for the ISP. So IXPs aren’t a problem area. ISPs being able to get to IXPs and do upgrades as necessary can be a problem right now, particularly when they need to take equipment and supplies to the IXP to perform the upgrade.  There are travel lockdowns, people have to look after their kids because schools are closed, and it’s getting harder and harder to pull necessary parts and equipment through the global supply-chain to the places where it’s needed. And Trump is still conducting his idiotic one-man trade-war with China, which we’re all paying for.",

It’s good for public health, because everyone’s cell phones don’t have to transmit at high wattage to reach a distant cell site. It’s good for battery life of phones, because phones don’t have to burn a ton of stored energy to transmit at high wattage.  That, in turn, means you can have a smaller, cheaper, lighter, more reliable phone, that’s just as effective. It’s good for network infrastructure and growth because more users can be served in a smaller area, which means better market penetration. And lastly, it’s good for user-received performance, because the RF spectrum isn’t being shared among as many users, and as broad an area. \n\nSo, 5G is a good thing. But. 5G has also been used as a stalking-horse for a million other, unrelated issues, and that’s super-confusing for users, who shouldn’t even need to know that it exists, to benefit from it. There are the anti-vaxxer crowd, who misunderstand the health benefits, because they’re innumerate, and they think that a cell site being closer means their body is going to absorb more RF energy, rather than less. There are the surveillance folks, who conflate Chinese data-collection methods with Huawei dominance in the 5G cell site hardware space, and try to link 5G to surveillance. \n\nIt’s quite reasonable for one government to not want another government doing surveillance within its borders. But that holds true for any network operations or infrastructure or equipment, not specifically or more so for 5G.  It’s just that Huawei has gotten to market ahead of other companies with 5G hardware that’s brought this issue to the fore, and confused politicians, because politicians tend to be easily confused when they see too many buzzwords lumped together and don’t have staffers with specific expertise in this area. There’s a very real fight, in the WTO, in the ITU, in the IETF, between the Chinese government’s way of doing surveillance, and the west.  That’s a legit fight to have, from both perspectives, even if it doesn’t benefit actual users or citizens in any way. I mean, it's legit from a governmental point of view. It's also the case that all governments tend to lead with propaganda, in fights like this. But western governments have gotten their feet tangled up in the 5G buzzwords, and aren’t clearly focused on their target, which should be outlawing the importation of network equipment which is back-doored. Of course, just like poor people voting for kleptocrats, every government wants backdoors, because they mistakenly think that they’ll benefit from them at some point, rather than only ever being a victim of them, as is actually the case.",

That means that they’re spewing a gigantic trail of personal information out to these companies. The notion that any form of encryption or authentication will help, when you pick an untrustworthy counterpart, is fallacious.\n\nSo…  The first thing about DNSSEC is that you have to actually do it.  You can’t just depend on someone else to validate DNSSEC signatures and tell you, second-hand, that everything’s fine.  Because if they’re a business, and you’re not the customer, they’ll lie to you to make money; they’ll lie to you to serve the interests of their actual customers.\n\nAnd DoH (DNS-over-HTTPs) is a scam, through and through.  It’s a weapon that content companies are using in the Network Neutrality fight, to harm their competitors, at the expense of their users.  Again, that’s a rathole that I could spend a long time on, and will later, if there are follow-up questions.  The important thing is to not get your DNS from (meaning don’t use a recursive resolver supplied by) someone who’s also in the business of selling content.\n\nDANE is the replacement for the Certificate Authority system. Like IPv6, DANE was designed a long time ago, to address a very specific failure of the Internet’s design, which only became obvious after it was rolled out. Like IPv6, it’s taking *forever* to get ubiquitously deployed, and we have a massive, and massively expensive, problem until that transition is completed.  And there are companies with whole business models which are dependent upon the ongoing failure, so fight tooth-and-nail to prevent the upgrades from completing. \n\nDANE lets you generate self-signed certificates to secure your TLS connections, and put those certificates into DNSSEC-signed zones in the DNS, associated with the resources people are trying to reach. For example, if someone is trying to send you email, their mailserver will look up the address of your mailserver in the DNS.  Along with the answer (the IP address), they’ll also get the appropriate certificate to use to authenticate the TLS connection, and they’ll get a DNSSEC signature over the whole thing. In the future world in which everybody does things right, they’d then validate the DNSSEC signature so they’d know they hadn’t been spoofed, then they’d use the certificate to initiate a TLS connection to your mailserver, and deliver the mail.  The DNS already tells them how long they can cache the IP address and certificate, so they don’t need to go through all that again a moment later, when there’s another piece of mail, but they would need to repeat the process a day later, in case your mailserver had moved, or your certificate had been updated. But the important thing is that it’s entirely under your control, costs you nothing to implement, and can’t be undermined by third parties.",

In the future world in which everybody does things right, they’d then validate the DNSSEC signature so they’d know they hadn’t been spoofed, then they’d use the certificate to initiate a TLS connection to your mailserver, and deliver the mail.  The DNS already tells them how long they can cache the IP address and certificate, so they don’t need to go through all that again a moment later, when there’s another piece of mail, but they would need to repeat the process a day later, in case your mailserver had moved, or your certificate had been updated. But the important thing is that it’s entirely under your control, costs you nothing to implement, and can’t be undermined by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
