I think I acquired it in the markets and in life because I found that to not be balanced and to not see all perspectives would be painfully costly. One might say that being this way was beaten into me by my interactions with reality. Also, meditating helped me a lot. And writing down my principles for dealing with situations helped me see how the same things would happen over and over again in an almost mechanical way that allowed me to look down on myself and my circumstances from a higher, more dispassionate level. I find a lot of people are caught within the circumstance that they're in and have challenges putting those in perspective and dealing with them in a principled way. I think that once one gets in the habit of looking at everything as \"another one of those\" (rather than each thing individually) and thinking about the principles for dealing with it, one naturally gets in the habit of operating the way you describe.",

One might say that being this way was beaten into me by my interactions with reality. Also, meditating helped me a lot.

They then go to printing money and buying financial assets (which I call Monetary Policy 2), which causes financial asset prices to rise which helps those who have financial assets but isn&amp;#39;t nearly as good for those who don&amp;#39;t, so it widens the wealth gap. Still, it is necessary, though it ceases to be effective. Europe and Japan are now in that position, and the US will probably find itself in that position in the next downturn. That is when central banks have to go to what I call Monetary Policy 3, in which central governments run deficits to stimulate spending and these deficits are monetized by central bankers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To see numerous examples of these, I suggest you read both part I and part II of &amp;quot;It’s Time to Look More Carefully at “Monetary Policy 3 (MP3)” and “Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)” on &lt;a href=\"http://www.economicprinciples.com\"&gt;www.economicprinciples.com&lt;/a&gt;. The overarching principle is that when there is a large wealth and values gap between people who have to share a budget and there is an economic downturn, and monetary policy is not effective in reversing it, there is a high likelihood of significant conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
