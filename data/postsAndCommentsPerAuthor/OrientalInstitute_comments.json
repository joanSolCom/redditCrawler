One thing I really enjoy about being a curator is having the opportunity to examine objects in our collection. With objects such as statues, you can see how they were made and also how they were used. Because they were excavated, we know something about their ancient lives in temples, where they stood as representations of the individuals who donated them.\n \n[Kiersten] One of my favorite objects in the gallery is a bronze figurine in the Assyrian Empire gallery, who sadly is often misunderstood because of modern day cinema. If you’ve seen the movie the Exorcist, you may recall seeing a demon in the opening scene. The inspiration behind this figure is Pazuzu, a mythological figure from ancient Mesopotamia whom inscriptions refer to as the “king of the evil lilû-demons.” Visual imagery and ancient texts tell us that Pazuzu had a leonine face, scaly body, large razor-like talons, scorpion tail, and wings of a bird. Because of his appearance and supernatural strength, he was invoked as a protective force to expel other destructive demons, making him a complicated and ambiguous figure—in other words, he was not solely the evil demon represented by the Exorcist. For example, bronze figurines and plaques were used to protect homes, and pregnant women wore Pazuzu-head amulets, fibulae (garment pins), and pendants to ward off the lion-headed demoness Lamashtu, who threatened to snatch and devour their newborn children.",

I became a curator when I was in graduate school getting my PhD in art history and archaeology. I was offered a fellowship to work in a museum, and I was in the right place at the right time because a permanent position opened up while I was working there. In my specific field of ancient Middle Eastern antiquities, a lot of my fellow curators have a PhD related to the collections they curate. But there are many different ways to become a curator, and the hardest part sometimes is just getting your foot in the door. I would suggest looking for opportunities such as internships where you can start to get some experience.\n\n[Kiersten] For me, it all started with my early love of Xena: Warrior Princess and Tomb Raider! But let’s jump forward a few years to my actual career path. Much like Jean, as a PhD student working on a degree in art history and archaeology of the ancient Middle East, I had the opportunity to work part time at a small academic archaeology museum, which not only provided some extra funds but also fulfilled a love I had for working with objects when not excavating or traveling to museum collections for research. That opportunity helped pave the way for the path I found myself on after the PhD—en route to Chicago to take the position of curatorial assistant, which later morphed into museum curator and research associate, and communications associate for a spell, at the OI. If you’re looking to pursue a similar path, I encourage people to find ways to get experience with objects, whether working on field excavations or in a museum setting.",

There is a long-standing debate about the number of people who resided in Mesopotamian settlements—the density of occupation of Mesopotamian cities has been discussed for decades, but most scholars accept that anywhere from 100 to 200 people per hectare lived in these cities. The earliest-known city in Mesopotamia was that of Uruk. By 3000 BC, Uruk was about 100 hectares in size, and so we estimate the population of Uruk to have been around 10,000–20,000 inhabitants.",

There is a long-standing debate about the number of people who resided in Mesopotamian settlements—the density of occupation of Mesopotamian cities has been discussed for decades, but most scholars accept that anywhere from 100 to 200 people per hectare lived in these cities. The earliest-known city in Mesopotamia was that of Uruk. By 3000 BC, Uruk was about 100 hectares in size, and so we estimate the population of Uruk to have been around 10,000–20,000 inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
