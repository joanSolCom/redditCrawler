There’s also a variety of online communities that have sprung up on Facebook, Instagram, etc. (like Daily Burn’s active Facebook [community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dailyburncommunity/)) that can help bridge that transition from in-person to at-home workouts. \n\nAlso, if you’re quarantining with a partner or roommate that is down to help you, here are a few suggested exercises that can be done between two people. Do each exercise back to back for 30 seconds each. Repeat 5x, resting 30 to 45 sec between each round:\n\n* Partner Plan &amp; Jump Over - One person is in the plank position the other jumps over and then switches\n* Rotational Throws - With a medicine ball or any other type of weight stand profile to your partner using trunk rotations. Throw the ball to your partner, repeat 30 sec and then switch directions.\n* Plank Hand Taps - Facing each other in a plank, lift your opposite hand from your partner’s to give them a high five and repeat with the other hand.\n* Sit Up and Throw with Medicine Balls (or other weights) - With both of you on your back, feet to feet, crunch up at the same time. The partner with the medicine ball tosses it to the other, then both return to the starting position.",

Tie the two ends together and you can slip your feet in and do mountain climbers, untie them and you can do pulling exercises and pistol squats, tricep extensions, curtsy lunges, or a high pull.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for workouts to do without any equipment (and without disturbing your downstairs neighbors!), here are a few of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wall Squats - This is a bit harder than a regular squat and challenges you to see how long you can hold it. To take it up a notch hold weights, a child, or a textbook on your lap.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sit Thrus - This exercise seems simple but after a few you feel your heart rate go up, your quads, shoulders, and core fire up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Squat to Rotational Press - This is a multi-level movement that works your entire body. An added benefit is that if you have no weights or light weights you can increase the speed and kick up the cardio aspect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
