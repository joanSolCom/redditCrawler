A lot of times its just a good way to process all of the things we deal with as the helper. \n\nFor me, it was like being able to take everything I'm going through and processing with a friend, only it's not a friend. And that's the beauty of it. Because the therapist isn't a friend, I don't have to be concerned with how what I have to say will effect them. \n\nWhen I was doing therapy, I always went in with the mindset of \"I'm just going to go in and set down all this emotional stuff I've been carrying around with me. If at the end of the session I want to pick it up and carry it out with me I can; at least I get a little break.\" Most of the time, once I 'set my baggage down', I just left it there and felt great leaving. \n\nThe great thing is you don't have to commit to years of therapy. I always like to tell people to give it 3 sessions and just see how you feel. By the third session, you and your therapist start to know each other and it gets way easier. \n\nBest of luck.  SCOOPFEST 2020!!! \n\n\\-Nick",

Willingness to look at themselves in a healthy critical way can make a big difference in behavior. \n2. No. On the show I'm pretty open about my cultural and political beliefs, but I don't let that influence the way I work with people. At the end of the day I want to understand my patient, not be understood by them. If they say something I disagree with I genuinely want to feel their perspective. Therapist's actually train really hard to be able to join with their patient no matter who they are and set aside their own personal values and ideals. I find it pretty easy honestly because when I'm in therapist mode I just really really like my patient and want to hear them. \n3. Hypersensitivity is a thing, though I'm not keen on labels. I like your sense of awareness on it though. Now its about identifying the questions you must ask yourself when you feel a reaction coming through you. Checking in on things like mind reading and being aware of the intention of others. I'm a crier myself, so I get it, I've had to work on this alot in my life. \n4. Yes. ADHD has more to do with thinking patterns and inabilities to concentrate. As a general rule clinicians don't diagnose something unless there is a \"clinically significant amount of distress\" - no problems no diagnosis. \n5. Wanted to become a therapist since I was 16, but got discouraged because I didn't want to do a doctorate. So I went into religion and thought I'd help people that way. Became a highschool teacher and gave my students a career test, took it myself and it said therapist. So I start looking into it and realize I can go get a masters degree and do it that way. Got the masters and doctorate anyway and love the path I've been on. We started the podcast because we felt there was a need for a non-academic, true to life voice that happened to be competent and authoritative. We wanted to bridge the gap between the humorous and interesting but unqualified people giving advice and the highly qualified but boring people giving advice. \n6. Probably, unless I can do sessions from a beach house or something online which would be rad. \n7. Dog person for like 10 years, but I love cats. There are my speed. I just want cuddles.",

At worst the person is given human contact and attention and starts working on life, at best we save their life. \n\nHaving said that depression is a confusing thing. It isn't black and white and a lot of people report it at various stages of severity causing friends and family to be confused as to when it is a problem and how to help. \n\nI'm uncomfortable with the idea of \"faking\" it, because even if a person is reporting depression falsely there is still a reason behind that - that reason is worth them connecting with a therapist to explore.",

We addressed a similar one here:  &lt;a href=\"https://podtherapy.net/post/611734534076186624/113-psychology-todays-sexual-fantasies\"&gt;https://podtherapy.net/post/611734534076186624/113-psychology-todays-sexual-fantasies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My default advice is to always behave as if depression is real. At worst the person is given human contact and attention and starts working on life, at best we save their life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having said that depression is a confusing thing. It isn&amp;#39;t black and white and a lot of people report it at various stages of severity causing friends and family to be confused as to when it is a problem and how to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable with the idea of &amp;quot;faking&amp;quot; it, because even if a person is reporting depression falsely there is still a reason behind that - that reason is worth them connecting with a therapist to explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We have had a bunch of questions on this one over time so I know its something a lot of people relate to. \n\nSelf care is first - We have to remember we didn't cause it, we can't control it, we can't cure it. Its important we dont slip into personalizing somebody else's pain. \n\nSecond - sometimes we have leverage and can nudge a person toward help by setting boundaries with them and making it clear what our expectations are. \n\nThird - Sometimes we have no leverage whatsoever. Part of the reason we created our show was to give people a taste of what talking to a therapist is like. Maybe you could find an episode that might resonate with the person and share it with them.

We have had a bunch of questions on this one over time so I know its something a lot of people relate to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self care is first - We have to remember we didn&amp;#39;t cause it, we can&amp;#39;t control it, we can&amp;#39;t cure it. Its important we dont slip into personalizing somebody else&amp;#39;s pain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second - sometimes we have leverage and can nudge a person toward help by setting boundaries with them and making it clear what our expectations are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third - Sometimes we have no leverage whatsoever. Part of the reason we created our show was to give people a taste of what talking to a therapist is like. Maybe you could find an episode that might resonate with the person and share it with them. That drip-drip-drip of a positive message can sometimes loosen them up and make them willing to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Its a lonely road to be so stubborn and I get your frustration in the situation. \n\nI do have some nuanced thoughts about Narcissistic PD and Sociopathic diagnoses, you can listen here:  [https://podtherapy.net/post/184430183683/69-psychopathy-narcissism-machiavellianism](https://podtherapy.net/post/184430183683/69-psychopathy-narcissism-machiavellianism) \n\nThird, sometimes you can get a person to start going to therapy by telling them you'd like to go as a family.

About 50% of my patients get paid back a percentage of their fees by their insurance. \n\n(C) Your employer may offer an EAP option with therapy included for low cost.\n\n(D) Contacting a therapist and asking if they offer a sliding scale is a good idea, but if they are all booked they might not. \n\n(E) Better Help and Talk Space (who don't sponsor my show but probably should) are good options too. They contract with actual therapists in your state, they are cost effective, and its a good idea. Another thing is using a platform like Teledoc, Amwell, LiveHealth Online, etc - those are built by insurances and work with insurances to connect you for very low cost. \n\n(F) I get that the cost is hard to swallow. I also like that you don't think it'll be a one and done process and are preparing for a longer engagement. Consider this: if you saw a therapist once a week for a whole year (which is unlikely btw) and it cost $100 / session that is at most $5200 for the year. Thats a small cost when you consider 52 hours with healthcare provider one on one, and a small cost when you consider other things you might drop $5K on over the course of a year.

About 50% of my patients get paid back a percentage of their fees by their insurance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(C) Your employer may offer an EAP option with therapy included for low cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(D) Contacting a therapist and asking if they offer a sliding scale is a good idea, but if they are all booked they might not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(E) Better Help and Talk Space (who don&amp;#39;t sponsor my show but probably should) are good options too. They contract with actual therapists in your state, they are cost effective, and its a good idea. Another thing is using a platform like Teledoc, Amwell, LiveHealth Online, etc - those are built by insurances and work with insurances to connect you for very low cost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(F) I get that the cost is hard to swallow. I also like that you don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be a one and done process and are preparing for a longer engagement. Consider this: if you saw a therapist once a week for a whole year (which is unlikely btw) and it cost $100 / session that is at most $5200 for the year. Thats a small cost when you consider 52 hours with healthcare provider one on one, and a small cost when you consider other things you might drop $5K on over the course of a year. But I feel you, spending money blows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You didn't say that, but in case its simmering beneath the surface I want to speak to it. I think its ok to want relationships. We are humans, tribal people, relational to our core. No, we aren't happy when we are lonely. No, there is nothing broken or wrong about that. Yes, we are allowed to yearn for companionship. Yes, we are allowed to proactively seek it. \n\nHaving said that I also appreciate the need to sometimes reach acceptance about certain unchanageable realities. As I said (see point 1) I'm reluctant to see this as permanent, but 5 years is a bit of a drought romantically for some people. Im super interested in the way you are socializing, how you are meeting people, and what it might look like to adapt our strategy and expectations to make room for new people. Consider partnering with a therapist to discuss that, I'll bet it gets better.",

Masters and Doctoral students are required to do almost a year of free counseling for the community as part of their training, its a great way to start working with a trained almost-professional with no out of pocket costs. \n\nThe good news - well, not good, let me try again - the...news...is that EVERYBODY has trash insurance. That's what insurance is! Deductibles make it so most people are paying out of pocket for their therapy even if they are completely covered, because finding a therapist is a personal experience and the person you connect with isn't always in network. Anyway, go to [www.PsychologyToday.com](https://www.PsychologyToday.com) or Yelp and find a therapist you like, contact them and ask if they have a \"sliding scale\" - tell them Jim from Pod Therapy sent you and in their confusion of who the fuck Jim is and what a Pod Therapy is they will probably just give you an appointment and offer you a reduced fee. If they can't ask them if they know of any pro-bono options in your community, they will usually have some suggestions. \n\nThe only unacceptable thing is to not do anything. Get out there and make some calls. There is always a way to make it work.",

Masters and Doctoral students are required to do almost a year of free counseling for the community as part of their training, its a great way to start working with a trained almost-professional with no out of pocket costs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news - well, not good, let me try again - the...news...is that EVERYBODY has trash insurance. That&amp;#39;s what insurance is! Deductibles make it so most people are paying out of pocket for their therapy even if they are completely covered, because finding a therapist is a personal experience and the person you connect with isn&amp;#39;t always in network. Anyway, go to &lt;a href=\"https://www.PsychologyToday.com\"&gt;www.PsychologyToday.com&lt;/a&gt; or Yelp and find a therapist you like, contact them and ask if they have a &amp;quot;sliding scale&amp;quot; - tell them Jim from Pod Therapy sent you and in their confusion of who the fuck Jim is and what a Pod Therapy is they will probably just give you an appointment and offer you a reduced fee. If they can&amp;#39;t ask them if they know of any pro-bono options in your community, they will usually have some suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only unacceptable thing is to not do anything. Get out there and make some calls. There is always a way to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "1. Las Vegas has legalized gambling (literally everywhere, even in gas stations), legalized marijuana, 24 hour bars (nobody hear has ever heard the phrase \"last call\"), 24 hour liquor stores, strip-clubs, brothels nearby, and pretty much everything else a person might find disruptive to their healthiest self. The result is that many of our patients run the gauntlet every day to practice self-control and avoid self-medicating with those things or abusing those things. \n\nThe joke in the industry is that Las Vegas is the superbowl of the psychotherapy. We like to think we are the best in the game because, frankly, we kind of have to be. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is I'm a god-damn gift to humanity, and everybody should say so alot. \n\nAnyway, you get used to Vegas and eventually people navigate around those obstacles as naturally as people in Louisiana drive around alligators. Every city has unique challenges, humans are resilient and adaptable. \n\n2. Human ALWAYS makes it better. Sometimes I make my patients select a different comedy stand up, podcast or comedic show as a regular part of their treatment routine. Having said that, depression is a fickle bitch. Yes its partly perspective (hopelessness, worthlessness, and suspecting that death would be a good thing are delusions and that aren't real no matter how hard much they try to sell themselves) and yes its partly bio-chemical (medicine is part of the solution and people generally benefit from incorporating it into their treatment). In the end depression is like a weather system that just sort of rolls in, partnering with a good therapist and being open to good medicine can really help. Also laugh alot, its healthy. \n\n3. Corona has devastated Las Vegas. As the nation's playground the entire economy pretty much floats on top of a hedonistic capitalism. Unemployment topped 30% here, and lots of people are hurting. This has been the busiest I've ever been in my professional life, and most local therapists report the same. Our caseloads have doubled - and Nevada already ranked 51st in the nation in mental health so we were sort of busy as it was. The good news is people are learning how to be there for one another, and communities attached to things like podcasts - eh emm, listen to ours - have formed support groups online to get people through it. Another bright side is people finally figured out how to use telehealth, so now I don't have to wear pants anymore! \n\nThe protests were a big thing in patient's lives too. Whether people were scared by them, inspired by them, or awoken by them it always played a role in their therapeutic growth. \n\n4.  This is Jim and I'll say the baddest badass of them all is Carl Rogers. Dude literally wrote the book on the fundamentals of how to heal people and his approach is now the foundation of all modern psychotherapy. \n\n5. We are pro-masks. If you listen to the corona era episodes of our show I (Jim) am either calling in from home or wearing  a t-shirt over my face. Partly because I have a kid who is vulnerable and partly because my own generalized anxiety disorder no likey the rona. War masks.",

The result is that many of our patients run the gauntlet every day to practice self-control and avoid self-medicating with those things or abusing those things. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The joke in the industry is that Las Vegas is the superbowl of the psychotherapy. We like to think we are the best in the game because, frankly, we kind of have to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m trying to say is I&amp;#39;m a god-damn gift to humanity, and everybody should say so alot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you get used to Vegas and eventually people navigate around those obstacles as naturally as people in Louisiana drive around alligators. Every city has unique challenges, humans are resilient and adaptable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human ALWAYS makes it better. Sometimes I make my patients select a different comedy stand up, podcast or comedic show as a regular part of their treatment routine. Having said that, depression is a fickle bitch. Yes its partly perspective (hopelessness, worthlessness, and suspecting that death would be a good thing are delusions and that aren&amp;#39;t real no matter how hard much they try to sell themselves) and yes its partly bio-chemical (medicine is part of the solution and people generally benefit from incorporating it into their treatment). In the end depression is like a weather system that just sort of rolls in, partnering with a good therapist and being open to good medicine can really help. Also laugh alot, its healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corona has devastated Las Vegas. As the nation&amp;#39;s playground the entire economy pretty much floats on top of a hedonistic capitalism. Unemployment topped 30% here, and lots of people are hurting. This has been the busiest I&amp;#39;ve ever been in my professional life, and most local therapists report the same. Our caseloads have doubled - and Nevada already ranked 51st in the nation in mental health so we were sort of busy as it was. The good news is people are learning how to be there for one another, and communities attached to things like podcasts - eh emm, listen to ours - have formed support groups online to get people through it. Another bright side is people finally figured out how to use telehealth, so now I don&amp;#39;t have to wear pants anymore! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The protests were a big thing in patient&amp;#39;s lives too. Whether people were scared by them, inspired by them, or awoken by them it always played a role in their therapeutic growth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Jim and I&amp;#39;ll say the baddest badass of them all is Carl Rogers. Dude literally wrote the book on the fundamentals of how to heal people and his approach is now the foundation of all modern psychotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are pro-masks. If you listen to the corona era episodes of our show I (Jim) am either calling in from home or wearing  a t-shirt over my face. Partly because I have a kid who is vulnerable and partly because my own generalized anxiety disorder no likey the rona. War masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "GREAT question. Unlike other healthcare professionals, you actually need to like your therapist. It won't matter if you connect to your cardiologist or gynecologist on a human level, but that is absolutely vital to a therapeutic relationship.\n\nA good therapist is anybody you feel you can connect to in a genuine way. Sometimes that is a person who's demographics/background look nothing like yours, sometimes that is a person who seems familiar to you. Key qualities in an experienced and effective therapist:   \n\\- They disarm you and put you at ease  \n\\- They facilitate sharing so you open up naturally  \n\\- They make you feel safe and unjudged   \n\\- They can leap tall buildings in a single bound  \n\\- They are comfortable with humor to put your at ease   \n\\- You don't dread visiting with them  \n\\- They have their own podcast and know how to reddit \n\nIf you feel stuck with your current therapist here are a few suggestions:   \n1. Share with the therapist that you feel like you've hit a lull in your personal growth. Don't necessarily blame the therapist, just reflect on feeling stuck as if its a weather system and ask them if they have any ideas or challenges for you to take the next step in your work.   \n2. Ask your therapist if you can revisit your goals with them. Tell them you want to identify some new areas to develop in and ask them for suggestions.   \n3. If you're not feeling good with your therapist because you just don't feel a good connection to them, or their style isn't really a good fit for you, its ok to go back to the pool and start looking around again. Lots of people do different work with different therapists, and we therapists are pretty comfortable with you cheating on us - er, collaborating with other professionals - on your quest for personal growth.",

        "body": "FYITF!! \n\nOur listeners gave some great feedback. Personally, I've been on both sides of therapy. It's fairly common for therapists to have therapists. A lot of times its just a good way to process all of the things we deal with as the helper. \n\nFor me, it was like being able to take everything I'm going through and processing with a friend, only it's not a friend. And that's the beauty of it. Because the therapist isn't a friend, I don't have to be concerned with how what I have to say will effect them. \n\nWhen I was doing therapy, I always went in with the mindset of \"I'm just going to go in and set down all this emotional stuff I've been carrying around with me. If at the end of the session I want to pick it up and carry it out with me I can; at least I get a little break.\" Most of the time, once I 'set my baggage down', I just left it there and felt great leaving. \n\nThe great thing is you don't have to commit to years of therapy.

It&amp;#39;s fairly common for therapists to have therapists. A lot of times its just a good way to process all of the things we deal with as the helper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, it was like being able to take everything I&amp;#39;m going through and processing with a friend, only it&amp;#39;s not a friend. And that&amp;#39;s the beauty of it. Because the therapist isn&amp;#39;t a friend, I don&amp;#39;t have to be concerned with how what I have to say will effect them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was doing therapy, I always went in with the mindset of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just going to go in and set down all this emotional stuff I&amp;#39;ve been carrying around with me. If at the end of the session I want to pick it up and carry it out with me I can; at least I get a little break.&amp;quot; Most of the time, once I &amp;#39;set my baggage down&amp;#39;, I just left it there and felt great leaving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The great thing is you don&amp;#39;t have to commit to years of therapy. I always like to tell people to give it 3 sessions and just see how you feel. By the third session, you and your therapist start to know each other and it gets way easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck.

Willingness to look at themselves in a healthy critical way can make a big difference in behavior. \n2. No. On the show I'm pretty open about my cultural and political beliefs, but I don't let that influence the way I work with people. At the end of the day I want to understand my patient, not be understood by them. If they say something I disagree with I genuinely want to feel their perspective. Therapist's actually train really hard to be able to join with their patient no matter who they are and set aside their own personal values and ideals. I find it pretty easy honestly because when I'm in therapist mode I just really really like my patient and want to hear them. \n3. Hypersensitivity is a thing, though I'm not keen on labels. I like your sense of awareness on it though. Now its about identifying the questions you must ask yourself when you feel a reaction coming through you. Checking in on things like mind reading and being aware of the intention of others. I'm a crier myself, so I get it, I've had to work on this alot in my life. \n4. Yes. ADHD has more to do with thinking patterns and inabilities to concentrate. As a general rule clinicians don't diagnose something unless there is a \"clinically significant amount of distress\" - no problems no diagnosis. \n5. Wanted to become a therapist since I was 16, but got discouraged because I didn't want to do a doctorate. So I went into religion and thought I'd help people that way. Became a highschool teacher and gave my students a career test, took it myself and it said therapist. So I start looking into it and realize I can go get a masters degree and do it that way. Got the masters and doctorate anyway and love the path I've been on. We started the podcast because we felt there was a need for a non-academic, true to life voice that happened to be competent and authoritative. We wanted to bridge the gap between the humorous and interesting but unqualified people giving advice and the highly qualified but boring people giving advice. \n6. Probably, unless I can do sessions from a beach house or something online which would be rad. \n7. Dog person for like 10 years, but I love cats. There are my speed. I just want cuddles.",

By diagnosing with all those different labels the providers might be able to force the insurance to cover the care the patient is going to need. Sometimes the clinician just wants a full report. For example: if a patient has had depression throughout their cycles, or before the onset of bipolar, then their depression may be chronic and independent of the bipolar even though of course its influenced by it. \n\nAnother way to look at it is the symptoms themselves. The clinician may diagnose anxiety disorder because they are noticing the panic attacks and thought processes consistent with the label despite the contributing factors of bipolar or ADHD. \n\nIn the end I get that all those terms can feel like a mouthful.

It isn&amp;#39;t black and white and a lot of people report it at various stages of severity causing friends and family to be confused as to when it is a problem and how to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable with the idea of &amp;quot;faking&amp;quot; it, because even if a person is reporting depression falsely there is still a reason behind that - that reason is worth them connecting with a therapist to explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Its important we dont slip into personalizing somebody else's pain. \n\nSecond - sometimes we have leverage and can nudge a person toward help by setting boundaries with them and making it clear what our expectations are. \n\nThird - Sometimes we have no leverage whatsoever. Part of the reason we created our show was to give people a taste of what talking to a therapist is like. Maybe you could find an episode that might resonate with the person and share it with them.

Its important we dont slip into personalizing somebody else&amp;#39;s pain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second - sometimes we have leverage and can nudge a person toward help by setting boundaries with them and making it clear what our expectations are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third - Sometimes we have no leverage whatsoever. Part of the reason we created our show was to give people a taste of what talking to a therapist is like. Maybe you could find an episode that might resonate with the person and share it with them. That drip-drip-drip of a positive message can sometimes loosen them up and make them willing to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Its a lonely road to be so stubborn and I get your frustration in the situation. \n\nI do have some nuanced thoughts about Narcissistic PD and Sociopathic diagnoses, you can listen here:  [https://podtherapy.net/post/184430183683/69-psychopathy-narcissism-machiavellianism](https://podtherapy.net/post/184430183683/69-psychopathy-narcissism-machiavellianism) \n\nThird, sometimes you can get a person to start going to therapy by telling them you'd like to go as a family. Or she and her daughter can go.

About 50% of my patients get paid back a percentage of their fees by their insurance. \n\n(C) Your employer may offer an EAP option with therapy included for low cost.\n\n(D) Contacting a therapist and asking if they offer a sliding scale is a good idea, but if they are all booked they might not. \n\n(E) Better Help and Talk Space (who don't sponsor my show but probably should) are good options too. They contract with actual therapists in your state, they are cost effective, and its a good idea. Another thing is using a platform like Teledoc, Amwell, LiveHealth Online, etc - those are built by insurances and work with insurances to connect you for very low cost. \n\n(F) I get that the cost is hard to swallow. I also like that you don't think it'll be a one and done process and are preparing for a longer engagement. Consider this: if you saw a therapist once a week for a whole year (which is unlikely btw) and it cost $100 / session that is at most $5200 for the year. Thats a small cost when you consider 52 hours with healthcare provider one on one, and a small cost when you consider other things you might drop $5K on over the course of a year.

About 50% of my patients get paid back a percentage of their fees by their insurance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(C) Your employer may offer an EAP option with therapy included for low cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(D) Contacting a therapist and asking if they offer a sliding scale is a good idea, but if they are all booked they might not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(E) Better Help and Talk Space (who don&amp;#39;t sponsor my show but probably should) are good options too. They contract with actual therapists in your state, they are cost effective, and its a good idea. Another thing is using a platform like Teledoc, Amwell, LiveHealth Online, etc - those are built by insurances and work with insurances to connect you for very low cost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(F) I get that the cost is hard to swallow. I also like that you don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be a one and done process and are preparing for a longer engagement. Consider this: if you saw a therapist once a week for a whole year (which is unlikely btw) and it cost $100 / session that is at most $5200 for the year. Thats a small cost when you consider 52 hours with healthcare provider one on one, and a small cost when you consider other things you might drop $5K on over the course of a year. But I feel you, spending money blows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You didn't say that, but in case its simmering beneath the surface I want to speak to it. I think its ok to want relationships. We are humans, tribal people, relational to our core. No, we aren't happy when we are lonely. No, there is nothing broken or wrong about that. Yes, we are allowed to yearn for companionship. Yes, we are allowed to proactively seek it. \n\nHaving said that I also appreciate the need to sometimes reach acceptance about certain unchanageable realities. As I said (see point 1) I'm reluctant to see this as permanent, but 5 years is a bit of a drought romantically for some people. Im super interested in the way you are socializing, how you are meeting people, and what it might look like to adapt our strategy and expectations to make room for new people. Consider partnering with a therapist to discuss that, I'll bet it gets better.",

Masters and Doctoral students are required to do almost a year of free counseling for the community as part of their training, its a great way to start working with a trained almost-professional with no out of pocket costs. \n\nThe good news - well, not good, let me try again - the...news...is that EVERYBODY has trash insurance. That's what insurance is! Deductibles make it so most people are paying out of pocket for their therapy even if they are completely covered, because finding a therapist is a personal experience and the person you connect with isn't always in network. Anyway, go to [www.PsychologyToday.com](https://www.PsychologyToday.com) or Yelp and find a therapist you like, contact them and ask if they have a \"sliding scale\" - tell them Jim from Pod Therapy sent you and in their confusion of who the fuck Jim is and what a Pod Therapy is they will probably just give you an appointment and offer you a reduced fee. If they can't ask them if they know of any pro-bono options in your community, they will usually have some suggestions. \n\nThe only unacceptable thing is to not do anything. Get out there and make some calls. There is always a way to make it work.",

Masters and Doctoral students are required to do almost a year of free counseling for the community as part of their training, its a great way to start working with a trained almost-professional with no out of pocket costs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news - well, not good, let me try again - the...news...is that EVERYBODY has trash insurance. That&amp;#39;s what insurance is! Deductibles make it so most people are paying out of pocket for their therapy even if they are completely covered, because finding a therapist is a personal experience and the person you connect with isn&amp;#39;t always in network. Anyway, go to &lt;a href=\"https://www.PsychologyToday.com\"&gt;www.PsychologyToday.com&lt;/a&gt; or Yelp and find a therapist you like, contact them and ask if they have a &amp;quot;sliding scale&amp;quot; - tell them Jim from Pod Therapy sent you and in their confusion of who the fuck Jim is and what a Pod Therapy is they will probably just give you an appointment and offer you a reduced fee. If they can&amp;#39;t ask them if they know of any pro-bono options in your community, they will usually have some suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only unacceptable thing is to not do anything. Get out there and make some calls. There is always a way to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "1. Las Vegas has legalized gambling (literally everywhere, even in gas stations), legalized marijuana, 24 hour bars (nobody hear has ever heard the phrase \"last call\"), 24 hour liquor stores, strip-clubs, brothels nearby, and pretty much everything else a person might find disruptive to their healthiest self. The result is that many of our patients run the gauntlet every day to practice self-control and avoid self-medicating with those things or abusing those things. \n\nThe joke in the industry is that Las Vegas is the superbowl of the psychotherapy. We like to think we are the best in the game because, frankly, we kind of have to be. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is I'm a god-damn gift to humanity, and everybody should say so alot. \n\nAnyway, you get used to Vegas and eventually people navigate around those obstacles as naturally as people in Louisiana drive around alligators. Every city has unique challenges, humans are resilient and adaptable. \n\n2. Human ALWAYS makes it better. Sometimes I make my patients select a different comedy stand up, podcast or comedic show as a regular part of their treatment routine. Having said that, depression is a fickle bitch. Yes its partly perspective (hopelessness, worthlessness, and suspecting that death would be a good thing are delusions and that aren't real no matter how hard much they try to sell themselves) and yes its partly bio-chemical (medicine is part of the solution and people generally benefit from incorporating it into their treatment). In the end depression is like a weather system that just sort of rolls in, partnering with a good therapist and being open to good medicine can really help. Also laugh alot, its healthy. \n\n3. Corona has devastated Las Vegas. As the nation's playground the entire economy pretty much floats on top of a hedonistic capitalism. Unemployment topped 30% here, and lots of people are hurting. This has been the busiest I've ever been in my professional life, and most local therapists report the same. Our caseloads have doubled - and Nevada already ranked 51st in the nation in mental health so we were sort of busy as it was. The good news is people are learning how to be there for one another, and communities attached to things like podcasts - eh emm, listen to ours - have formed support groups online to get people through it. Another bright side is people finally figured out how to use telehealth, so now I don't have to wear pants anymore! \n\nThe protests were a big thing in patient's lives too. Whether people were scared by them, inspired by them, or awoken by them it always played a role in their therapeutic growth. \n\n4.  This is Jim and I'll say the baddest badass of them all is Carl Rogers. Dude literally wrote the book on the fundamentals of how to heal people and his approach is now the foundation of all modern psychotherapy. \n\n5. We are pro-masks. If you listen to the corona era episodes of our show I (Jim) am either calling in from home or wearing  a t-shirt over my face. Partly because I have a kid who is vulnerable and partly because my own generalized anxiety disorder no likey the rona. War masks.",

The result is that many of our patients run the gauntlet every day to practice self-control and avoid self-medicating with those things or abusing those things. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The joke in the industry is that Las Vegas is the superbowl of the psychotherapy. We like to think we are the best in the game because, frankly, we kind of have to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m trying to say is I&amp;#39;m a god-damn gift to humanity, and everybody should say so alot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you get used to Vegas and eventually people navigate around those obstacles as naturally as people in Louisiana drive around alligators. Every city has unique challenges, humans are resilient and adaptable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human ALWAYS makes it better. Sometimes I make my patients select a different comedy stand up, podcast or comedic show as a regular part of their treatment routine. Having said that, depression is a fickle bitch. Yes its partly perspective (hopelessness, worthlessness, and suspecting that death would be a good thing are delusions and that aren&amp;#39;t real no matter how hard much they try to sell themselves) and yes its partly bio-chemical (medicine is part of the solution and people generally benefit from incorporating it into their treatment). In the end depression is like a weather system that just sort of rolls in, partnering with a good therapist and being open to good medicine can really help. Also laugh alot, its healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corona has devastated Las Vegas. As the nation&amp;#39;s playground the entire economy pretty much floats on top of a hedonistic capitalism. Unemployment topped 30% here, and lots of people are hurting. This has been the busiest I&amp;#39;ve ever been in my professional life, and most local therapists report the same. Our caseloads have doubled - and Nevada already ranked 51st in the nation in mental health so we were sort of busy as it was. The good news is people are learning how to be there for one another, and communities attached to things like podcasts - eh emm, listen to ours - have formed support groups online to get people through it. Another bright side is people finally figured out how to use telehealth, so now I don&amp;#39;t have to wear pants anymore! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The protests were a big thing in patient&amp;#39;s lives too. Whether people were scared by them, inspired by them, or awoken by them it always played a role in their therapeutic growth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Jim and I&amp;#39;ll say the baddest badass of them all is Carl Rogers. Dude literally wrote the book on the fundamentals of how to heal people and his approach is now the foundation of all modern psychotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are pro-masks. If you listen to the corona era episodes of our show I (Jim) am either calling in from home or wearing  a t-shirt over my face. Partly because I have a kid who is vulnerable and partly because my own generalized anxiety disorder no likey the rona. War masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "GREAT question. Unlike other healthcare professionals, you actually need to like your therapist. It won't matter if you connect to your cardiologist or gynecologist on a human level, but that is absolutely vital to a therapeutic relationship.\n\nA good therapist is anybody you feel you can connect to in a genuine way. Sometimes that is a person who's demographics/background look nothing like yours, sometimes that is a person who seems familiar to you. Key qualities in an experienced and effective therapist:   \n\\- They disarm you and put you at ease  \n\\- They facilitate sharing so you open up naturally  \n\\- They make you feel safe and unjudged   \n\\- They can leap tall buildings in a single bound  \n\\- They are comfortable with humor to put your at ease   \n\\- You don't dread visiting with them  \n\\- They have their own podcast and know how to reddit \n\nIf you feel stuck with your current therapist here are a few suggestions:   \n1. Share with the therapist that you feel like you've hit a lull in your personal growth. Don't necessarily blame the therapist, just reflect on feeling stuck as if its a weather system and ask them if they have any ideas or challenges for you to take the next step in your work.   \n2. Ask your therapist if you can revisit your goals with them. Tell them you want to identify some new areas to develop in and ask them for suggestions.   \n3. If you're not feeling good with your therapist because you just don't feel a good connection to them, or their style isn't really a good fit for you, its ok to go back to the pool and start looking around again. Lots of people do different work with different therapists, and we therapists are pretty comfortable with you cheating on us - er, collaborating with other professionals - on your quest for personal growth.",
