I&amp;#39;ve stayed at a tiny house community in Florida called the Orlando Lakefront. It&amp;#39;s situated on the lake and offers residents water activities, a community garden, and community events. There are others located in Texas and Oregon that are popular, as well. When doing your research for tiny house communities, make sure you keep in mind what your wants and needs are — again. Do you want your village to be close to a body of water, close to a city, or close to local hiking routes? -FO&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Hello! This is definitely a complicated question. It depends a lot on the builder you choose, where they are located, and what exactly you want in your tiny house. At the start of the movement years ago, you might have been able to get a tiny house for $15,000 to $20,000, but now the movement has grown. Today, tiny houses cost between $30,000 and $150,000. Keep in mind that the cool houses on Instagram are some of the most expensive ones, so keep your expectations realistic. \n\nIf you want to go cheaper than that, you might want to consider building your own tiny house. That can cost as little as $10,000, but of course, it could be difficult if you don't have building experience. \n\nLastly, you mention that the cost of land will be easier to research, but I want to make sure you don't push this bit of the process to the side. For most tiny house owners, finding a builder is the easy part and finding a piece of land for the tiny house is the hard part. Zoning laws across the country aren't necessarily friendly to tiny houses, so it's not as easy as buying a plot of land and parking it there. Make sure you understand where and how you will park your car before moving into the building process. -FO",

Get rid of the things that you haven't touched in several months or even years. Once you narrow down your belongings, find unique and inventive ways to store them. Remember every nook and cranny in your condo counts: underneath your bed, under your couch, the top of your fridge, etc. Think about hangings shelves that go all the way to the ceiling to store belongings high up. Additionally, tiny house owners are especially great at using furniture for multiple purposes. For example, a kitchen table is not just a place to eat but also a workspace. Also, think about ways you can store the furniture you don't always use. Foldaway tables are great and a Murphy bed is an awesome way to save space during the day.  -FO",

Everything must be able to be fact-checked and proven to be correct. No made-up characters, bits of dialogue, or information.\n\nFor instance, for our first project with Insider (What Trump Did to be Impeached) I toyed around with the concept of having two generic aides with Nancy Pelosi.

Although I'm not in your exact situation, I understand your sentiment about how sucky it is to go from seeing someone every day to hardly ever. \n\nI was in a long-distance relationship for 4 years with my BF after living in the same town and seeing each other daily. Then, when we were long-distance, we only saw each other for 1 weekend every other month. It was not fun, as you know.\n\nSimilar to you, there were times we would talk on the phone or via video chat and I'd be in a bad mood or pick a fight, and it felt horrible. But I also knew I wanted to be with my BF and he wanted to be with me over all of the other options, so we decided to make the best of a bad situation.

Then, when we were long-distance, we only saw each other for 1 weekend every other month. It was not fun, as you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similar to you, there were times we would talk on the phone or via video chat and I&amp;#39;d be in a bad mood or pick a fight, and it felt horrible. But I also knew I wanted to be with my BF and he wanted to be with me over all of the other options, so we decided to make the best of a bad situation. We&amp;#39;ve been together for almost 9 years now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying you have to be chipper all of the time because that&amp;#39;s not realistic, but think about how much better you and your GF would feel if when you talked on the phone, you caught up on each other&amp;#39;s days, discussed a TV show you both recently watched, or had a virtual dinner together.

If he does want advice and you've noticed he's always packing his schedule with dates, tell him to [consider slowing down](https://www.insider.com/slow-dating-what-is-it-how-can-it-help-love-2018-11) and just going on 1 or 2 dates per week so he can really focus on the people he's meeting and make quality connections.\n\nI think it's also fair to call out the fact he seems to have too many non-negotiables for his prospective love interests and that habit could be preventing him from meeting someone really cool. \n\nOne dating coach told me she only lets her clients have 4 hard-and-fast rules about the people they date. For example, if your friend is totally against dating a smoker and must date someone who likes animals, that's fine, but if he's getting as granular as the color of a date's hair or the way they laugh, he might need to re-evaluate his priorities.\n\nHere are some more tips for sprucing up his dating profile that could help: [https://www.insider.com/can-you-find-love-without-dating-apps-2019-6](https://www.insider.com/can-you-find-love-without-dating-apps-2019-6)  \n\n\n\\- J",

I was never as big of a gamer as him. (Sure, I grew up playing Frogger, Pokemon, Tekken, Need for Speed, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro, but I wasn't as hands on w/ Halo or Metroid Prime). I was really into it b/c of the narrative story and the choose-your-own-adventure intrigue. It was like watching a little movie. (FWIW - Before Bandersnatch came out on Netflix, the streamer asked me whether or not I thought a choose-your-own-adventure type story could succeed on the platform or not... and I cited Telltale as a reason for it being a no-brainer... not that Netflix is in the game space.)\n\nEventually, I started playing the game on my own, and realized it was something simple enough for me to do. I actually loved Telltale's take on Batman as well. An underrated one, I believe. If someone was smart, they'd invest some money into making some more of these, but CAREFULLY choosing which IP to create games for.

        "body": "I'm going to tell you about a few. \n\nI've spoken with Greg Nicotero ahead of every season premiere and mid-season premiere since I want to say season five or six. He's always very excited to talk about the walker process. I was trying to speak w/ him for the finale so he could talk about making frozen walkers and walkers that popped out of the snow, but I guess he had limited availability or, you know, just EW got him. Sometimes, that's the reality of it. That's okay. A few years back, Greg told me he wanted to do walkers in a different climate, colder one. So, that's why I wanted to hear from him about putting this episode together. But, oh well. Next time.\n\nI have felt absolutely spoiled to speak with Angela Kang several times over this season (I think the count is four.) That feels insane and I've enjoyed every convo with her. By now, I think she knows I come in to every call with far too many Qs that I know I'll never get to, but I always try to ask her different things that I don't think others will. More recently, for a larger episode, I asked Brandon Davis over at ComicBook if he wanted to collaborate and try and divide and conquer so we both weren't grabbing the same people for the pike death episode. In cases where we both get 10 minutes w/ Angela, it's probably better for us (and for fans) if we try and not double up on most Qs. It's incredibly tough to manage time and keep the convo moving in a short span of time w/o feeling a little rude. Thankfully, I think they understand a bit. As I was saying, with Angela, it's easy to tell how much love she has for the show. You can just hear it in her voice. Hoping I can meet her in person at an upcoming AMC event next week.\n\nTom Payne was so funny and unfiltered. He had no problem spilling tea when I spoke with him. He was very honest about some cut scenes w/ Jesus + a boyfriend he had on the show and how he felt bored with the role. I was surprised by how open he was. https://www.thisisinsider.com/walking-dead-tom-payne-frustrated-bored-with-jesus-role-2018-11\nI still can't believe he played a corpse for an entire episode. \n\nMichael Cudlitz — He caught me off guard near the end of our call for 907, which he directed. A day or two before our call, I tweeted out the following: \"What can I say about 907 for now #TWDFamily? Carylers, this one's for you.\"  I didn't mean anything bad by it. Just that there was a lot of Carol and Daryl in the episode. Almost, instantly, I realized that might be taken the wrong way and clarified my tweet to add that I simply meant there was a lot of Carol and Daryl in the episode. I was out w/ a friend and thought it would be fine. It wasn't. Let's just say, I underestimated how intense that part of the fandom was and started getting an intense amount of flak. Well, Cudlitz noticed and brought it up during our call. He said something to the effect of, you got in a little trouble on Twitter / dug yourself into a hole, etc. I must have turned a shade of white over the phone.\n\nI never put this in my writeups on the episode, but we chatted for a few mins about Twitter, how things get taken out of context, and how it made me think about how I word things before sharing them with the world. I have tried to avoid tweeting anything about Caryl ever since. The season nine finale did not help. As for Cudlitz, very nice man, but, I'm not sure if he likes me. I'm not sure if he thought I was trying to get a rise out of the fandom. I saw him again in December at WSC. He was with fans really early before the floor was even open, taking photos. He must have been the first celeb there and he's not even on the show anymore. I didn't go up to him, but was told by someone who works the event that he's always one of the first there. He definitely cares about the fans. \n\nKatelyn Nacon / Khary Payton — I could probably tell you of the few times I've spoken w/ Katelyn over the years, but most recently while I was on my call w/ Katelyn someone jumped on the phone and said, \"One more question. Katelyn's gotta go.\" I assumed it was a PR person. Normal. I continued and Katelyn started laughing. I was so confused. Then I heard, \"Hi. It's Khary.\" Before it sunk in and I could ask anything else, he ran off. This was extra funny b/c I was on the phone speaking w/ Khary the week before. I have no idea if he knew it was me on the phone (or if he even remembered me). That was the highlight of my day.\n\nMillicent Shelton - I have to give a shoutout to the director of 914 - Scars. Millicent was SO fun to speak with. She had such thoughtful answers, had been trying to work on TWD for years, and clearly had a vision for this episode. We ended up speaking for about 20 mins and by the end of it, I think we were both bummed the call had to come to an end. A moment that sticks out is when she was recalling Rutina Wesley hitting Danai with the two-by-four. What a haunting, awful scene, but Millicent was laughing recounting how Rutina was going to town \"wailing\" on Danai. She said there was more and they had to cut it out. ",

While I can't speak to the quality of specific plans, I would advise you to do your research before purchasing. Make sure the plans are accurate, include all safety measures, and adhere to building codes. Also, make sure that the plan that you choose fits your wants and needs. A tiny house model that works for some, might not work for all. \n\nAs for tiny house villages, there are a ton all over the US. I've stayed at a tiny house community in Florida called the Orlando Lakefront. It's situated on the lake and offers residents water activities, a community garden, and community events.

While I can&amp;#39;t speak to the quality of specific plans, I would advise you to do your research before purchasing. Make sure the plans are accurate, include all safety measures, and adhere to building codes. Also, make sure that the plan that you choose fits your wants and needs. A tiny house model that works for some, might not work for all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for tiny house villages, there are a ton all over the US. I&amp;#39;ve stayed at a tiny house community in Florida called the Orlando Lakefront. It&amp;#39;s situated on the lake and offers residents water activities, a community garden, and community events. There are others located in Texas and Oregon that are popular, as well.

        "body": "Hello! This is definitely a complicated question. It depends a lot on the builder you choose, where they are located, and what exactly you want in your tiny house. At the start of the movement years ago, you might have been able to get a tiny house for $15,000 to $20,000, but now the movement has grown. Today, tiny houses cost between $30,000 and $150,000. Keep in mind that the cool houses on Instagram are some of the most expensive ones, so keep your expectations realistic. \n\nIf you want to go cheaper than that, you might want to consider building your own tiny house. That can cost as little as $10,000, but of course, it could be difficult if you don't have building experience. \n\nLastly, you mention that the cost of land will be easier to research, but I want to make sure you don't push this bit of the process to the side. For most tiny house owners, finding a builder is the easy part and finding a piece of land for the tiny house is the hard part. Zoning laws across the country aren't necessarily friendly to tiny houses, so it's not as easy as buying a plot of land and parking it there. Make sure you understand where and how you will park your car before moving into the building process. -FO",

Get rid of the things that you haven't touched in several months or even years. Once you narrow down your belongings, find unique and inventive ways to store them. Remember every nook and cranny in your condo counts: underneath your bed, under your couch, the top of your fridge, etc. Think about hangings shelves that go all the way to the ceiling to store belongings high up. Additionally, tiny house owners are especially great at using furniture for multiple purposes. For example, a kitchen table is not just a place to eat but also a workspace. Also, think about ways you can store the furniture you don't always use. Foldaway tables are great and a Murphy bed is an awesome way to save space during the day.  -FO",

I was never as big of a gamer as him. (Sure, I grew up playing Frogger, Pokemon, Tekken, Need for Speed, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro, but I wasn't as hands on w/ Halo or Metroid Prime). I was really into it b/c of the narrative story and the choose-your-own-adventure intrigue. It was like watching a little movie. (FWIW - Before Bandersnatch came out on Netflix, the streamer asked me whether or not I thought a choose-your-own-adventure type story could succeed on the platform or not... and I cited Telltale as a reason for it being a no-brainer... not that Netflix is in the game space.)\n\nEventually, I started playing the game on my own, and realized it was something simple enough for me to do. I actually loved Telltale's take on Batman as well. An underrated one, I believe. If someone was smart, they'd invest some money into making some more of these, but CAREFULLY choosing which IP to create games for.

        "body": "I'm going to tell you about a few. \n\nI've spoken with Greg Nicotero ahead of every season premiere and mid-season premiere since I want to say season five or six. He's always very excited to talk about the walker process. I was trying to speak w/ him for the finale so he could talk about making frozen walkers and walkers that popped out of the snow, but I guess he had limited availability or, you know, just EW got him. Sometimes, that's the reality of it. That's okay. A few years back, Greg told me he wanted to do walkers in a different climate, colder one. So, that's why I wanted to hear from him about putting this episode together. But, oh well. Next time.\n\nI have felt absolutely spoiled to speak with Angela Kang several times over this season (I think the count is four.) That feels insane and I've enjoyed every convo with her. By now, I think she knows I come in to every call with far too many Qs that I know I'll never get to, but I always try to ask her different things that I don't think others will. More recently, for a larger episode, I asked Brandon Davis over at ComicBook if he wanted to collaborate and try and divide and conquer so we both weren't grabbing the same people for the pike death episode. In cases where we both get 10 minutes w/ Angela, it's probably better for us (and for fans) if we try and not double up on most Qs. It's incredibly tough to manage time and keep the convo moving in a short span of time w/o feeling a little rude. Thankfully, I think they understand a bit. As I was saying, with Angela, it's easy to tell how much love she has for the show. You can just hear it in her voice. Hoping I can meet her in person at an upcoming AMC event next week.\n\nTom Payne was so funny and unfiltered. He had no problem spilling tea when I spoke with him. He was very honest about some cut scenes w/ Jesus + a boyfriend he had on the show and how he felt bored with the role. I was surprised by how open he was. https://www.thisisinsider.com/walking-dead-tom-payne-frustrated-bored-with-jesus-role-2018-11\nI still can't believe he played a corpse for an entire episode. \n\nMichael Cudlitz — He caught me off guard near the end of our call for 907, which he directed. A day or two before our call, I tweeted out the following: \"What can I say about 907 for now #TWDFamily? Carylers, this one's for you.\"  I didn't mean anything bad by it. Just that there was a lot of Carol and Daryl in the episode. Almost, instantly, I realized that might be taken the wrong way and clarified my tweet to add that I simply meant there was a lot of Carol and Daryl in the episode. I was out w/ a friend and thought it would be fine. It wasn't. Let's just say, I underestimated how intense that part of the fandom was and started getting an intense amount of flak. Well, Cudlitz noticed and brought it up during our call. He said something to the effect of, you got in a little trouble on Twitter / dug yourself into a hole, etc. I must have turned a shade of white over the phone.\n\nI never put this in my writeups on the episode, but we chatted for a few mins about Twitter, how things get taken out of context, and how it made me think about how I word things before sharing them with the world. I have tried to avoid tweeting anything about Caryl ever since. The season nine finale did not help. As for Cudlitz, very nice man, but, I'm not sure if he likes me. I'm not sure if he thought I was trying to get a rise out of the fandom. I saw him again in December at WSC. He was with fans really early before the floor was even open, taking photos. He must have been the first celeb there and he's not even on the show anymore. I didn't go up to him, but was told by someone who works the event that he's always one of the first there. He definitely cares about the fans. \n\nKatelyn Nacon / Khary Payton — I could probably tell you of the few times I've spoken w/ Katelyn over the years, but most recently while I was on my call w/ Katelyn someone jumped on the phone and said, \"One more question. Katelyn's gotta go.\" I assumed it was a PR person. Normal. I continued and Katelyn started laughing. I was so confused. Then I heard, \"Hi. It's Khary.\" Before it sunk in and I could ask anything else, he ran off. This was extra funny b/c I was on the phone speaking w/ Khary the week before. I have no idea if he knew it was me on the phone (or if he even remembered me). That was the highlight of my day.\n\nMillicent Shelton - I have to give a shoutout to the director of 914 - Scars. Millicent was SO fun to speak with. She had such thoughtful answers, had been trying to work on TWD for years, and clearly had a vision for this episode. We ended up speaking for about 20 mins and by the end of it, I think we were both bummed the call had to come to an end. A moment that sticks out is when she was recalling Rutina Wesley hitting Danai with the two-by-four. What a haunting, awful scene, but Millicent was laughing recounting how Rutina was going to town \"wailing\" on Danai. She said there was more and they had to cut it out. ",

        "body": "Hi there, \n\nLast year, I attended an event for AMC Network called its first annual summit last June. Gimple was in attendance on a panel speaking at length about adapting books to screen. I think I've felt a lot of similar frustrations as some here, especially over the way Carl was removed from the show (which is a whole other conversation). Then I heard him speak, and, well... I just felt differently. \n\nI just went back and found the recorded conversation. It's from the morning of June, 20, 2018. Here's a piece of what he said.\n\n\"I was a fan of The Walking Dead comic before I was working in television and as I was working in television. As I was reading it, it never crossed my mind — Oh yeah, this is going to be a TV show. In fact, I just never thought it'd be a TV show. I just loved the comic. I was happy the comics exist. But then I saw those posters at bus stops around Los Angeles. [this received some laughter from the crowd, so Gimple made an aside that he hung out at bus stops a lot. that also received laughter] It was a photograph that recreated one of the panels and it tore my mind open. I, obviously, I was psyched it was a show...\n\nMore on adapting changes from the story to screen. Gimple was asked whether or not it's scary \"to take a detour\" for TWD. \n\n\"It is. And that is my answer... Being a fan of it to start with, you want to do right by the moments that you've seen. But to do right by the moments you've seen, sometimes you have to remix them, because people like myself who are familiar with the work, know what's coming. So, you're not going to get that surprise. You're not going to get that emotional twist. You're not going to get that build. So, to do right by the book, to tell the book with absolute fidelity sometimes, you have to change it. That said, you're sort of sneakily trying to get into the exact thing that Robert [Kirkman] did. And to do that, it takes a little bit of misdirection.\" \n\nTHIS is the part that got me — \n\n\"Back when we started, Robert and I argued a lot about... because I wanted to do the book just as the book and he actually wanted to do changes because he had already done it. And, yet, I wanted to see those moments that I saw in the book. And yet as I worked more and more on it, because I was so familiar with those moments, I knew that making those little twists to give the reader, it's actually doing right by the people who read the book and know what's coming. You try and put them in a place where they don't know what's coming... It's been a learning experience. It's been finding out how to drift away from the text to get back to the text.\"\n\nThat made me empathize a bit more w/ him as a person. Then... he was on Talking Dead and just teased a bunch of things w/o saying anything. With Angela, I feel like she really wants to be as open as she can and forthright. Usually, I can ask her something and she'll answer. The tough Qs that can be uncomfortable when you're criticizing a show nine seasons deep and even absurd things like \"Where is Heath?\". I respect that so much. Maybe he contractually can't say anything, but I wish he was a little more open than just dangling a carrot b/c it's gotten old. It comes off as if he doesn't respect the fandom as much and from seeing him in person that doesn't seem to align w/ who I saw — who is clearly a fan. \n\nI don't think that's the response you were looking for, but thought it may be worth sharing.

I, obviously, I was psyched it was a show...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More on adapting changes from the story to screen. Gimple was asked whether or not it&amp;#39;s scary &amp;quot;to take a detour&amp;quot; for TWD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is. And that is my answer... Being a fan of it to start with, you want to do right by the moments that you&amp;#39;ve seen. But to do right by the moments you&amp;#39;ve seen, sometimes you have to remix them, because people like myself who are familiar with the work, know what&amp;#39;s coming. So, you&amp;#39;re not going to get that surprise. You&amp;#39;re not going to get that emotional twist. You&amp;#39;re not going to get that build. So, to do right by the book, to tell the book with absolute fidelity sometimes, you have to change it. That said, you&amp;#39;re sort of sneakily trying to get into the exact thing that Robert [Kirkman] did. And to do that, it takes a little bit of misdirection.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THIS is the part that got me — &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Back when we started, Robert and I argued a lot about... because I wanted to do the book just as the book and he actually wanted to do changes because he had already done it. And, yet, I wanted to see those moments that I saw in the book. And yet as I worked more and more on it, because I was so familiar with those moments, I knew that making those little twists to give the reader, it&amp;#39;s actually doing right by the people who read the book and know what&amp;#39;s coming. You try and put them in a place where they don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s coming... It&amp;#39;s been a learning experience. It&amp;#39;s been finding out how to drift away from the text to get back to the text.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That made me empathize a bit more w/ him as a person. Then... he was on Talking Dead and just teased a bunch of things w/o saying anything. With Angela, I feel like she really wants to be as open as she can and forthright. Usually, I can ask her something and she&amp;#39;ll answer. The tough Qs that can be uncomfortable when you&amp;#39;re criticizing a show nine seasons deep and even absurd things like &amp;quot;Where is Heath?&amp;quot;. I respect that so much. Maybe he contractually can&amp;#39;t say anything, but I wish he was a little more open than just dangling a carrot b/c it&amp;#39;s gotten old. It comes off as if he doesn&amp;#39;t respect the fandom as much and from seeing him in person that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to align w/ who I saw — who is clearly a fan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the response you were looking for, but thought it may be worth sharing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I don't expect it to become all about him again, but I'd like to see him involved in the Whisperer arc. \n\nBrandon Davis over at ComicBook [has a little more on Negan moving forward w/ Kang](https://comicbook.com/2019/03/31/the-walking-dead-negan-judith-redemption-comics-season-10/).\n\n&gt; \"I do think the way that Negan is, and I think sort of is in the comic book, he's like, 'Hey, man, I'm a joiner,'\" Kang said. \"He wants to be important to the situation, so this is very much inspired by what's in the comic book. We've just pushed it further along in time, and I think it's been interesting for us to play with a version of Negan, who... He's still Negan. Negan always has an edge. That's always my role for him. Negan can't ever fully go soft because then that isn't who he is. However, it's interesting to see what are the steps that he takes to try to redeem himself? What are some of the other aspects of his character that we haven't seen before?\"\n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; \"As somebody who's working at ComicBook.com, you know what comes in the comic,\" Kang said. \"There's some really interesting story for Negan moving forward, and we're going to kind of play with our version of it, but we just thought what is the way in which Negan gets out of prison in our world, and how is that similar to or different from the comic book version? So this all plays in his story moving forward.\"\n\nEarlier this season I asked Angela and Greg Nicotero whether or not someone like Negan deserves redemption, especially since the show included his harem of wives. That's [a bit of a longer read](https://www.thisisinsider.com/walking-dead-does-negan-deserve-redemption-2019-2), if you're so inclined.\n \n\n",

I don&amp;#39;t expect it to become all about him again, but I&amp;#39;d like to see him involved in the Whisperer arc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brandon Davis over at ComicBook &lt;a href=\"https://comicbook.com/2019/03/31/the-walking-dead-negan-judith-redemption-comics-season-10/\"&gt;has a little more on Negan moving forward w/ Kang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do think the way that Negan is, and I think sort of is in the comic book, he&amp;#39;s like, &amp;#39;Hey, man, I&amp;#39;m a joiner,&amp;#39;&amp;quot; Kang said. &amp;quot;He wants to be important to the situation, so this is very much inspired by what&amp;#39;s in the comic book. We&amp;#39;ve just pushed it further along in time, and I think it&amp;#39;s been interesting for us to play with a version of Negan, who... He&amp;#39;s still Negan. Negan always has an edge. That&amp;#39;s always my role for him. Negan can&amp;#39;t ever fully go soft because then that isn&amp;#39;t who he is. However, it&amp;#39;s interesting to see what are the steps that he takes to try to redeem himself? What are some of the other aspects of his character that we haven&amp;#39;t seen before?&amp;quot;\n...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As somebody who&amp;#39;s working at ComicBook.com, you know what comes in the comic,&amp;quot; Kang said. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s some really interesting story for Negan moving forward, and we&amp;#39;re going to kind of play with our version of it, but we just thought what is the way in which Negan gets out of prison in our world, and how is that similar to or different from the comic book version? So this all plays in his story moving forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this season I asked Angela and Greg Nicotero whether or not someone like Negan deserves redemption, especially since the show included his harem of wives. That&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/walking-dead-does-negan-deserve-redemption-2019-2\"&gt;a bit of a longer read&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;#39;re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If true, I think they should have given him the pike deaths. That's something another TWD writer and I discussed recently. \n\nFWIW - I usually don't write episode reviews outside of the season premieres, but as a longtime comic reader, I was kind of bummed out by some of the deaths. I wrote [my thoughts on that here](https://www.thisisinsider.com/the-walking-dead-pike-death-underwhelming-2019-3) and how I wished they killed off some bigger characters. With that in mind, I also realized that the show was in this weird place where they almost couldn't get rid of a super big character b/c they're dwindling (with Andy and Chandler gone, Lauren Cohan basically out the door, and, well... you can't kill off Michonne). I did think they could have killed off one of Magna's group to make an impact. I thought Luke or Kelly were getting the pike treatment. I'm also surprised Gabriel, Eugene, or Siddiq didn't get the pike. As Negan pointed out on the season finale, Rosita has quite the love quadrangle going on. To be clear, I enjoyed ep 915, but the reveal let me down a bit as a comic reader. On the flip side, I've spoken with non-comic readers who loved it and were genuinely shocked. \n\nAlso FWIW - I thought Erik over at Forbes also wrote a nice longread on this. \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/03/25/did-last-nights-shocking-episode-of-the-walking-dead-play-it-too-safe/\nI love how he broke down characters on the show into one of three segments: \nThe Core Cast: Rick, Daryl, Carol, Glenn (RIP), Maggie (MIA), Carl (RIP) etc. up until Michonne \nThe New Veterans: Rosita, Eugene, Gabriel, Abraham (RIP), Jerry, Ezekiel, Enid etc. \nand New Characters: Yumiko, Luke, Connie, Magna, Siddiq, and everyone after etc.\n\nHe did a nice job explaining the show's problem w/ many of those characters in the middle. \n\n&gt; So what's the problem with these New Veterans? Well, frankly they're just nowhere near as interesting, relatable or likable as the original cast. In many cases, they're less engaging characters than the new characters introduced this season. Frankly, I would have been more bummed out to see Magna or Luke die than Tara or Enid. And that's a problem.",

If we look at this historically, I see five more seasons the most. Look at how long Supernatural was running. Grey's Anatomy is still humming along at season 15.) However, I'd imagine they have to be looking at the endgame (no pun intended). Right now, the show has the Whisperers and then there's the Commonwealth. After that? Well, they're kind of caught up unless they start coming up with a lot of new, original material. \n\nIn 2015, I asked Kirkman for our original website, Business Insider, if he was worried about the show ever catching up with the comics and how long he saw this going for. He told me then he saw at least 11/12 seasons. \n\n&gt; \"We have a huge head start,\" Kirkman told Business Insider. \"We're many many years ahead of them [the comics] and Charlie Adlard and I continue to crank issues out every month.

(I haven't looked at this conversation in ages.)\n\n&gt; \"The show could fade in popularity and end at some point,\" said Kirkman. \"We're certainly aware of that and we have game plans in place for that if it were to happen.\"\n\n&gt; \"I would argue that our show isn't solely a zombie show. It's a survival show,\" Kirkman adds. \"If you've been paying attention to the comics the zombies certainly fluctuate from being very in the forefront to being very far into the background and not being a very big part of the comic at all. And I think the show will follow a similar trajectory. So, I think as long as we can kind of be more than just a zombie show, we'll hopefully be okay if there's ever a big backlash to zombies but who knows what the future holds as far as the show's popularity goes.

(Mystery solved! It's Eugene!) Kidding. That's a joke me and one of the other Walking Dead writers at ComicBook were saying.

A lot of thoughtful stuff here. Some people have also asked me some items over Twitter, which I may address up here later. \n\nI’ll try to answer some of the quick Qs first and then will get to the longer ones. If there’s some time in between answering, I’m probably just writing a longer response. I like to try and be thorough. Let’s get to it!\n\nUPDATE: I have to get heading out for now for an appointment. I'll be back here later tonight (or if I can figure out an app) to continue answering in the meantime). Thanks for all your Qs and if I haven't gotten to yours, thanks for your patience. \n\nUpdate 2: I downloaded the app so I can keep answering some Qs on my commute.\n\nUpdate 3: App is useful to easily scroll, but not the best when trying to write out some of these longer, complicated answers. More when I'm at a computer. \n\nUpdate 4: Back and answering a few more this eve for a bit. Anything I don't get to (some of the longer answers) I'll look at towards the weekend. Thanks for understanding. \n\nUpdate 5: Answered a few more for now. Have to call it a night. Tomorrow eve I'm seeing Pet Sematary and then get a review up, so I may not be able to return here until Thurs eve or the weekend. I was going to say Friday night, but um, I'm supposed to be getting together w/ friends/fam for my birthday 😂.\n\nUpdate 6: Going to try and get to the rest of these throughout the week. Thanks!",

It is more of an ethical issue for Apple and Google in my view. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, they should say to the Saudi state &amp;#39;you&amp;#39;re making it hard for us to help you modernise your government, as you&amp;#39;re still making women get permission to travel.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One other example people cite is &amp;quot;People can be racist on Facebook but it&amp;#39;s not Facebook&amp;#39;s fault.&amp;quot;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In sum, no it&amp;#39;s not their place to take action based on their terms of service. But as western powerhouses, and liberal ones at that, they should seek to ask moral or ethical questions about what sort of acts they allow their apps to conduct. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That movie was my favorite growing up. That episode also references Betty's skills as a mechanic, which is a great callback to the comics. But as for the Archie Comics reference, I think it's so cool whenever they introduce familiar names like [Mr. Svenson](http://www.thisisinsider.com/riverdale-season-2-episode-7-recap-2017-11) and [Ms. Haggly](http://www.thisisinsider.com/riverdale-season-2-episode-11-recap-2018-1). I also love [that the drug Jingle Jangle](http://www.thisisinsider.com/riverdale-season-2-premiere-details-you-may-have-missed-2017-10#while-in-the-hospital-jughead-gives-archie-the-superhero-name-pureheart-the-powerful-1) is a reference to the Archies' song from the cartoon. That was really cool. \n\nAs for the second question, I do love Cheryl so much. I used to not be a fan of hers, but I have to say, I am loving her more and more every episode. She isn't afraid of standing up for herself and is such a strong character. One of my other favorite characters, though, is Alice. I just think she is so fascinating, and Mädchen is so talented.

There were two that came to mind right away so I hope I’m not forgetting any I’ve done prior to this season that were equally awesome. \n\nIt was really cool when Katelyn Nacon called me on my cell near the top of season eight from her apartment. But I think my favorite was speaking with Austin Amelio right after he was cast on the show. We've spoken a few times since, but I'll never forget how humble he was. He hadn't read the comics at the time and genuinely had no idea how big of a character Dwight was in the series. \n\n[Here's that quote](http://www.businessinsider.com/walking-dead-dwight-actor-austin-amelio-2016-11?r=UK&amp;IR=T): \n\n\"To me, it was just another audition in my life. Kind of hanging on,\" said Amelio. \"That's kind of how it is when \\[you're in\\] pilot season. Auditioning every day, but yeah I really had no idea about the show or Dwight or who I got cast as. I thought I was just going to go down there and shoot an episode and that was going to be it.\"\n\nIt gives you some insight into the actor's lives outside the show or before coming onto a show. \n\nWe spoke right after I watched the episode where he shot Daryl in the arm. I knew that would be a big cliffhanger. I was really surprised when he just told me [Daryl was going to be OK](http://www.businessinsider.com/walking-dead-daryl-alive-or-dead-2016-3). Looking back, AMC probably wouldn't have wanted that shared. \\(But I think after dumpstergate, it was better to not have another frustrating cliffhanger.\\) \n\nBut, honestly, all of the cast and crew I’ve spoken with have been very nice and generous with their time. Sidenote: At 2016’s SDCC, Jeffrey Dean Morgan pulled out Gale Ann Hurd’s chair for her before sitting down for press and after the panel was over he stayed behind to take some photos w/ international press.

They are both full \"alive\" and sentient now, but the way they got there and their actions are totally opposite.\n\nDolores is introspective, and became conscious through the bicameral mind approach. Her outlook on herself and the park is more rooted in philosophy and grandiose ideas about her own existence and purpose.\n\nMaeve was instead programmed to be able to wake up and therefore explore and understand all of the mechanical workings in the park. She has a much more holistic understanding of the park and Delos. But instead of escaping (as she was coded to do), she became fully sentient when she decided to return to the park to find her daughter. \n\nTo finally answer your question — I don't think Dolores is a weak part of the show. She's simply undergoing this journey in a more poetic and introspective way. And Maeve is in a larger external journey, which might be inherently more interesting to people (especially since we get more exposition on how the park works through Maeve's story).\n",

They are both full &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot; and sentient now, but the way they got there and their actions are totally opposite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dolores is introspective, and became conscious through the bicameral mind approach. Her outlook on herself and the park is more rooted in philosophy and grandiose ideas about her own existence and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maeve was instead programmed to be able to wake up and therefore explore and understand all of the mechanical workings in the park. She has a much more holistic understanding of the park and Delos. But instead of escaping (as she was coded to do), she became fully sentient when she decided to return to the park to find her daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To finally answer your question — I don&amp;#39;t think Dolores is a weak part of the show. She&amp;#39;s simply undergoing this journey in a more poetic and introspective way. And Maeve is in a larger external journey, which might be inherently more interesting to people (especially since we get more exposition on how the park works through Maeve&amp;#39;s story).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
