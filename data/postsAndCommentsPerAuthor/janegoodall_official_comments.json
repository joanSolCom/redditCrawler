The program has just recently been introduced into it's 100th country and continues to grow everyday. \n\nSome advice she gives to everyone who asks though, is that you must think and act locally. Focus on issues in your own community. Map out any potentially hazardous areas (polluted rivers, beaches, parks) and gather support from there. If everyone were to focus on their local communities, then the impact would eventually be global.  \n\nThanks for your question! ",

In Gombe we have witnessed acts that could be considered altruistic on various occasions. One example being when an orphaned 3 1/2 year old chimp, without older siblings (whom sometimes adopt their younger siblings) was taken in by an adolescent male around 12 years old. The older male allowed the orphaned chimp to follow him around (even making sure he kept up while they were on the move), allowing the orphan to cling to his underbelly when the orphan was scared and/or cold, and even allowing the orphaned chimp to sleep in the same 'night nest' as him. This is especially interesting considering that the adolescent male was not related to the orphaned chimp in the least.\n\nThanks for the question!",

One is the energy, commitment, and determination of young people and they are empowered to take action in programs like Roots &amp; Shoots. Secondly, the human brain. We have this extraordinary weapon. We are finally beginning to use it to create clean green energy and find a new way of interacting with the environment and live in harmony with the other creatures. It's very strange, in fact the most intellectual creature to ever walk the planet is destroying it's only home. And I believe there's a disconnect between a clever brain and the human heart and compassion. Only when the head and heart work in harmony can we reach our true human potential. And this, I believe, is to come. From the resilience of nature, we can help to once again support life. Animals are on the very brink of extinction and we have to give them another chance. Next there is social media, which as we all know can spew out a lot of rubbish and misinformation. But, used in the right way, it means that for the first time in human history, we can bring people to together around the world who all care about a particular issue like climate change so that there can be hundreds, thousands, millions, eventually billions of people all raising their voices and demanding change so that we can make a big difference and politicians will have two listen and will have to make change. And finally, the human spirit. People who tackle what seems impossible and never give up. It's so important to realize that every single one of us has that same indomitable spirit. We just have to nurture it and let it grow to make a bigger impact for good.",

It&amp;#39;s very strange, in fact the most intellectual creature to ever walk the planet is destroying it&amp;#39;s only home. And I believe there&amp;#39;s a disconnect between a clever brain and the human heart and compassion. Only when the head and heart work in harmony can we reach our true human potential. And this, I believe, is to come. From the resilience of nature, we can help to once again support life. Animals are on the very brink of extinction and we have to give them another chance. Next there is social media, which as we all know can spew out a lot of rubbish and misinformation. But, used in the right way, it means that for the first time in human history, we can bring people to together around the world who all care about a particular issue like climate change so that there can be hundreds, thousands, millions, eventually billions of people all raising their voices and demanding change so that we can make a big difference and politicians will have two listen and will have to make change. And finally, the human spirit. People who tackle what seems impossible and never give up. It&amp;#39;s so important to realize that every single one of us has that same indomitable spirit. We just have to nurture it and let it grow to make a bigger impact for good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

What had been stretching to the West Coast was now a tiny island surrounded by completely bare fields. People too poor to buy food from elsewhere. And struggling to survive. That is when it hit me. If we don't improve the lives of these people, there is no way we can conserve the chimpanzees. And that led to the Jane Goodall Institute program. We went not as a bunch of arrogant white people telling the villagers what to do to make their lives better, but with a hand-picked team sitting down, listening to the villagers, and asking them what they thought we could do to improve their lives. And that led to a very holistic program, which gradually grew and we could introduce new ways of helping. This paid off handsomely. The people in the villages are now our partners, helping us in conservation efforts. They've agreed to have a buffer between their villagers and the park to protect the chimpanzees. And the national Park, which was completely isolated, is now gradually being linked to other groups. And this program is now in 52 villages in the Gombe area, and it's in five other countries. And it is making a huge difference. Positive in introducing the youth program reaching the villages. It's probably the most important way in which we are able to conserve chimpanzee habitats. And I'll add to that, I would say we have placed great emphasis on education, helping them stay in school beyond puberty. We do this because it's been shown all around the globe that we all improve as women's education improves. One of our problems today is a growing number of humans. As our numbers grow, there are impacts and finite resources leading to more and more poverty and hunger.",

It's unsustainable, and we are told many of the nonrenewable natural resources are being exploited and used up faster than mother nature can replenish them.

And make choices thinking not only about how is this good for me now, but also how will this affect future generations.
