Plus, there more than 100 cities and towns across the country that pledged support for an open internet.  Then, Congress got in the mix.  The House passed the Save the Internet Act back in April, which would reinstate net neutrality at the FCC.  Then in October the court reviewed the agency's decision and found it was lacking in key areas.  It shipped it back to the FCC and asked the agency to rethink the consequences for public safety, low-income consumers, and infrastructure.

There are 34 million Americans without access to broadband at home, 23 million of them live in rural communities.  We need a plan to ensure that high-speed service reaches them where they live.  I think for starters we need to know today where service is and is not.  But right now the national broadband map is 3 years out of date.  Data that is three years old is like a lifetime in the internet age.  We need to fix this.  But I don't think that Washington should wait--we can begin by asking the public directly and using the wisdom of crowds.  To this end, I set up an e-mail address at the FCC to take in comments about where service is lacking and what can be done to improve it.  So please write in to broadbandfail@fcc.gov and let me know your stories.  You can be a part of fixing this infrastructure problem.",
