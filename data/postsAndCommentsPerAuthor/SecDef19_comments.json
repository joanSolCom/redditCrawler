If we act now, we can halt this plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can push for leaders to re-engage with long-standing arms control agreements, such as New START, and reinforce the strength of international nuclear norms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of all, what you yourself can do, is to demand that nuclear weapons are once again addressed by your politicians as a serious issue. To educate yourself, and to initiate conversations within your community, and to make sure that this issue is brought to the forefront.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress has been made in the past to lower the danger, and there was a time after the Cold War when I (Bill Perry) believed that the danger had passed, but we allowed ourselves to become complacent and forget what was at stake.  Change will not come about until there is significant public pressure once again to demand accountability on these destructive weapons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "I will go against what appears to be the consensus in this discussion and say that yes, the risk is very real that nuclear weapons will be used in your lifetime if things continue without change. \n\nWhile it is true that the most unlikely cause of a nuclear attack will be [what we feared during the Cold War](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:MSandE+NuclearBrink+SelfPaced/about), a surprise exchange between superpowers we called a \"bolt out of the blue\", as most countries recognize the futility of such an attack that will likely only lead to mutual devastation; however, the risk of a nuclear catastrophe has not gone down since the end of the Cold War. In fact, the risk has only increased.\n\nThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, creators of the Doomsday Clock, moved the clock to 2 minutes to midnight this year, a time not seen since the most perilous days of the Cold War right after the testing of the first thermonuclear weapons, stating nuclear concerns as their main reason as, \"Across the globe, nuclear weapons are poised to become more rather than less usable because of nations’ investments in their nuclear arsenals, with major nuclear actors on the cusp of a new arms race.\" \n\nThe U.S. is poised to spend [$1.2 Trillion over the next 30 years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-growing-dangers-of-the-new-nuclear-arms-race) on nuclear weapons upgrades, including new ICBMs and long range bombers, as well as developing new low-yield \"tactical\" nuclear weapons. These so-called \"tactical\" nuclear weapons are incredibly destabilizing due to the fact that they greatly increase the perspective that nuclear weapons could be used in conventional warfare; however, there is no guarantee that once the nuclear threshold has been breached, however small the yield, that it will not trigger an escalation spiral. At the same time, [China and Russia](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/28/china-nuclear-arms-race-610028) have both been ramping up their nuclear development as well, also seeking to pursue targeted \"smart\" tactical warheads, setting the stage for a new modern arms race happening right now. \n\nCritical arms control agreements are falling apart; Trump recently announced that the US will be pulling out of the [INF Treaty](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/INFtreaty), which eliminated all intermediate range ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles, further opening the door for nuclear weapons to be conceivably used in a regional dispute. [The JCPOA](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/impact-iran-nuclear-agreement), also known as the Iran Deal, was successful in preventing all major avenues for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and allowed for unprecedented levels of inspection. Without U.S. support, the deal will likely collapse and Iran hardliners will renew their efforts to obtain a nuclear arsenal.\n\nWhile Iran and North Korea dominate the headlines, it is actually [India and Pakistan](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/04/23/op-ed-nuclear-risks-india-pakistan-rivalry-south-asia.html) that present one of the most likely situations to trigger a nuclear attack between nuclear powers. India maintains a \"Cold Start\" doctrine strategy that, when triggered, would allow for India to seize Pakistan quickly without triggering conventional warfare - however this doctrine has inspired Pakistan to develop short-range nuclear weapons in order to thwart any such attack. This dynamic has lead many, including myself, to believe there is a significant possibility of [nuclear disaster in South East Asia](http://www.wjperryproject.org/nuclear-nightmares/).\n\nNorth Korea also poses a significant threat, although not the one most often painted by the media - Kim Jong Un is not a crazed mad man, and North Korea knows that launching a nuclear attack against the U.S. would result in their annihilation. The risk comes from if the U.S. is drawn into a conventional conflict, creating a desperate enough situation that they would launch their nuclear weapons as a last defense, likely devastating millions in South Korea or Japan. \n\nLast in this equation is the risk of nuclear terrorism, which is the [most likely source of a nuclear attack you will see in your lifetime](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+NuclearTerrorism+selfpaced/about). A dirty bomb, while it would not cause the same level of devastation as a thermonuclear warhead, would create [chaos far beyond what was witness in the wake of 9/11](http://www.wjperryproject.org/nuclear-nightmares/).\n\nAt 91 years old, it is likely that I will not witness another nuclear attack, but it is my hope that your generation will recognize and thwart this very real existential threat to humanity. - William Perry",

        "body": "I will go against what appears to be the consensus in this discussion and say that yes, the risk is very real that nuclear weapons will be used in your lifetime if things continue without change. \n\nWhile it is true that the most unlikely cause of a nuclear attack will be [what we feared during the Cold War](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:MSandE+NuclearBrink+SelfPaced/about), a surprise exchange between superpowers we called a \"bolt out of the blue\", as most countries recognize the futility of such an attack that will likely only lead to mutual devastation; however, the risk of a nuclear catastrophe has not gone down since the end of the Cold War. In fact, the risk has only increased.\n\nThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, creators of the Doomsday Clock, moved the clock to 2 minutes to midnight this year, a time not seen since the most perilous days of the Cold War right after the testing of the first thermonuclear weapons, stating nuclear concerns as their main reason as, \"Across the globe, nuclear weapons are poised to become more rather than less usable because of nations’ investments in their nuclear arsenals, with major nuclear actors on the cusp of a new arms race.\" \n\nThe U.S. is poised to spend [$1.2 Trillion over the next 30 years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-growing-dangers-of-the-new-nuclear-arms-race) on nuclear weapons upgrades, including new ICBMs and long range bombers, as well as developing new low-yield \"tactical\" nuclear weapons. These so-called \"tactical\" nuclear weapons are incredibly destabilizing due to the fact that they greatly increase the perspective that nuclear weapons could be used in conventional warfare; however, there is no guarantee that once the nuclear threshold has been breached, however small the yield, that it will not trigger an escalation spiral. At the same time, [China and Russia](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/28/china-nuclear-arms-race-610028) have both been ramping up their nuclear development as well, also seeking to pursue targeted \"smart\" tactical warheads, setting the stage for a new modern arms race happening right now. \n\nCritical arms control agreements are falling apart; Trump recently announced that the US will be pulling out of the [INF Treaty](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/INFtreaty), which eliminated all intermediate range ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles, further opening the door for nuclear weapons to be conceivably used in a regional dispute. [The JCPOA](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/impact-iran-nuclear-agreement), also known as the Iran Deal, was successful in preventing all major avenues for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and allowed for unprecedented levels of inspection. Without U.S. support, the deal will likely collapse and Iran hardliners will renew their efforts to obtain a nuclear arsenal.\n\nWhile Iran and North Korea dominate the headlines, it is actually [India and Pakistan](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/04/23/op-ed-nuclear-risks-india-pakistan-rivalry-south-asia.html) that present one of the most likely situations to trigger a nuclear attack between nuclear powers. India maintains a \"Cold Start\" doctrine strategy that, when triggered, would allow for India to seize Pakistan quickly without triggering conventional warfare - however this doctrine has inspired Pakistan to develop short-range nuclear weapons in order to thwart any such attack. This dynamic has lead many, including myself, to believe there is a significant possibility of [nuclear disaster in South East Asia](http://www.wjperryproject.org/nuclear-nightmares/).\n\nNorth Korea also poses a significant threat, although not the one most often painted by the media - Kim Jong Un is not a crazed mad man, and North Korea knows that launching a nuclear attack against the U.S. would result in their annihilation. The risk comes from if the U.S. is drawn into a conventional conflict, creating a desperate enough situation that they would launch their nuclear weapons as a last defense, likely devastating millions in South Korea or Japan. \n\nLast in this equation is the risk of nuclear terrorism, which is the [most likely source of a nuclear attack you will see in your lifetime](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+NuclearTerrorism+selfpaced/about). A dirty bomb, while it would not cause the same level of devastation as a thermonuclear warhead, would create [chaos far beyond what was witness in the wake of 9/11](http://www.wjperryproject.org/nuclear-nightmares/).\n\nAt 91 years old, it is likely that I will not witness another nuclear attack, but it is my hope that your generation will recognize and thwart this very real existential threat to humanity. - William Perry",

If we do not understand the danger, we will not take the necessary actions to avert the danger. Because we understand the serious consequences of an automobile collision, we advocate for seatbelts and speed limits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most likely way to reduce the likelihood of nuclear terrorism is the Nuclear Summit. The 4th and probably last Summit is coming up this month. If citizens understood how important those summits were to their own security, they could provide the impetus to continue the work of the summits to make us all safer. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
