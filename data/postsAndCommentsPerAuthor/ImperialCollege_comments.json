This is because cutting down existing forest may release more CO2 than new forests can absorb. That statement seems highly counter-intuitive, but it has to do with the way carbon cycles among all components of the earth system – land-based ecosystems, the ocean, and the atmosphere. The ocean has absorbed a large fraction of human CO2 emissions. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations are drawn down by planting lots of trees, than the ocean will release (‘outgas’) some of the CO2 it has absorbed in the past, just as a consequence of passive gas diffusion. However, if existing forest is cut down, much of the carbon in trees and soils will be released into the atmosphere. For this reason, scientists estimate that the largest possible tree-planting program could reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 40-70 ppm, but cutting down all remaining forest would increase atmospheric CO2 by about 130-290 ppm. \n\nAt the global scale, soil holds about 1500 Pg (gigatonnes) of carbon, while plants contain 560 Pg. So there is much more carbon in the soil than in the plants themselves!

First, how does the organization select and obtain land on which to plant? This is critical to avoiding what are called ‘leakage’ effects, when negative environmental impacts are displaced from one area to another. As an example, if an organization purchases land that is in active use for cattle pasture, fencing it off in order to plant trees, then the farmers may have to cut down forest elsewhere to graze their cattle. So you want to look out for an organization that is well embedded in the communities where forests will be established. Second, how will the organization select which species to plant? I’d avoid any operations that use a handful of non-native, fast-growing species, as this approach is least likely to achieve environmental co-benefits. Third, what plans are in place to continue monitoring and caring for the trees as they grow? A surprisingly large number of tree-planting projects can fail if the saplings are not looked after and protected from herbivory, etc. Finally – perhaps most importantly – protecting existing forest is more beneficial to the climate than establishing new forest. So I would be careful to select an organization that acknowledges this and balances tree planting activities with strategies to promote conservation and natural regeneration.",

There are many organizations, large and small, that do a great job conserving and regenerating forest -  rather than call out a few by name, I’ll describe the questions you should ask before donating to a particular group. First, how does the organization select and obtain land on which to plant? This is critical to avoiding what are called ‘leakage’ effects, when negative environmental impacts are displaced from one area to another. As an example, if an organization purchases land that is in active use for cattle pasture, fencing it off in order to plant trees, then the farmers may have to cut down forest elsewhere to graze their cattle. So you want to look out for an organization that is well embedded in the communities where forests will be established. Second, how will the organization select which species to plant? I’d avoid any operations that use a handful of non-native, fast-growing species, as this approach is least likely to achieve environmental co-benefits. Third, what plans are in place to continue monitoring and caring for the trees as they grow? A surprisingly large number of tree-planting projects can fail if the saplings are not looked after and protected from herbivory, etc. Finally – perhaps most importantly – protecting existing forest is more beneficial to the climate than establishing new forest. So I would be careful to select an organization that acknowledges this and balances tree planting activities with strategies to promote conservation and natural regeneration.",

        "body": "The fate of the Amazon is certainly critical to the whole climate system, and to the future of our planet’s biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that forest fragmentation (chopping the forest into smaller, disconnected ‘chunks’) increases the vulnerability of trees to other disturbances associated with climate change, including drought and wildfires. So, keeping the forest intact is critical, although doing so will depend on very complex political and economic drivers.\n\nThe good news is that tropical forests can often recover quite well from disturbance, if left to their own devices. In Central and South America, for instance, tree biomass reaches 90% of pre-disturbance values within about 65 years (although biodiversity can take much longer to fully recover, if at all). In certain cases, where the forest has been severely disturbed and the soil degraded, ‘assisted regeneration’ or direct tree planting might be necessary to help the ecosystem recover.\n\nReference: Brando et al. 2014 *PNAS* 111: 6347-6352.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of the Amazon is certainly critical to the whole climate system, and to the future of our planet’s biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that forest fragmentation (chopping the forest into smaller, disconnected ‘chunks’) increases the vulnerability of trees to other disturbances associated with climate change, including drought and wildfires. So, keeping the forest intact is critical, although doing so will depend on very complex political and economic drivers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that tropical forests can often recover quite well from disturbance, if left to their own devices. In Central and South America, for instance, tree biomass reaches 90% of pre-disturbance values within about 65 years (although biodiversity can take much longer to fully recover, if at all). In certain cases, where the forest has been severely disturbed and the soil degraded, ‘assisted regeneration’ or direct tree planting might be necessary to help the ecosystem recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reference: Brando et al. 2014 &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; 111: 6347-6352. &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6347\"&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6347&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poorter et al. 2016 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 530: 211-214&lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16512\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16512\"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16512&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rozendaal et al 2019 &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/3/eaau3114\"&gt; https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/3/eaau3114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I’ll outline a few below:\n\n**LOSSES OF SOIL CARBON**: We need to consider carbon not only in the bodies of trees, but also in the soil. Soil organic matter – the stuff that makes dirt brown or black – is full of carbon. In fact, soils contain more carbon than all terrestrial plants and the atmosphere combined! The amount of soil carbon reflects the balance between inputs (dead plant matter) and outputs (CO2 produced by decomposer microbes). Soil carbon ‘hotspots’ occur where decomposition is very slow, either because of the cold (permafrost) or flooding (peats and bogs). When trees are planted on peats, the soil must be drained for the trees to grow well. This triggers a large increase in the rate at which soil organic matter is decomposed, and the losses of CO2 from soil can be much greater than the gains of carbon in plant biomass.  \n\n**CHANGES IN FIRE REGIME**: Ecosystems dominated by grasses, like savannas, have evolved over millions of years to tolerate periodic fires. Planting trees too densely in these ecosystems can increase the severity of fires, and then much of the carbon captured in those trees is emitted as CO2 during a burn.\n\n**LOCAL WARMING THROUGH CHANGES IN ALBEDO**: At high latitudes (close to the poles), native vegetation is short, shrubby, and covered by snow most of the year. Snow reflects the sun’s energy back into space. As it gets warmer, it’s possible to plant trees at higher latitudes – but these trees are tall and dark, so they absorb the sun’s energy, even during the winter.\n\nReferences:\n\nFriggens et al. 2020 *Glob Change Biol* DOI: 10.1111/gcb.15229 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15229](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15229) \n\nWaring et al. 2020 DOI: 10.3389/ffgc.2020.00058\n\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00058/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00058/full)",

NREM sleep is so-called deep sleep and REM sleep is when we usually dream. NREM and REM sleep cycle for about 1.5 hours and on average we can have 5 cycles in one night. The feeling we have and our energy level depend on when exactly we wake up. If we wake up in the middle of a deep sleep (NREM sleep), we are likely to feel tired. But if we wake up when the sleep cycle is just finished, so the end of REM sleep, we usually feel refreshed. Of course the exact time of each cycle for everyone is different, if you could figure out the best duration for yourself, you can potentially reduce the chance of feeling tired after sleep. Hope this helps!",

I have taken it myself and I know it works. So I have no problem with it for occasional use, provided it is OK with your doctor (please always check). However, it is not something you want to take as a habit to help you sleep. These drugs can be addictive and have side effects on your memory (they act on many parts of your brain, not just sleep centers). The best way to ensure regular sleep is to try and adopt good sleep hygiene. This means always try to go to bed at a certain time, avoid phones/tablets/tv in the bedroom. And maybe use a natural daylight lamp first thing in the morning. Do exercise as well if you can.",

So I have no problem with it for occasional use, provided it is OK with your doctor (please always check). However, it is not something you want to take as a habit to help you sleep. These drugs can be addictive and have side effects on your memory (they act on many parts of your brain, not just sleep centers). The best way to ensure regular sleep is to try and adopt good sleep hygiene. This means always try to go to bed at a certain time, avoid phones/tablets/tv in the bedroom. And maybe use a natural daylight lamp first thing in the morning. Do exercise as well if you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is because as the disease progresses, all parts of the brain start to be affected.

There is also a phenomenon called “sundowning” in the late afternoon or early evening, when a person with dementia may act for example, more aggressively. This has been shown to result from damage to the part of the hypothalamus that contains the circadian clock. It is interesting to consider whether poor sleep itself makes Alzheimer’s disease worse, or during the course of a lifetime makes it more likely to get the disease.

From your question I’m not sure on the exact time you go to bed. It is possible that your body clock is telling you to sleep at midnight, while you go to bed at around 10 pm for example, so it will take 2-3 hours to fall asleep. It might be helpful if you only go to bed when you actually feel sleepy instead of waiting and struggling in bed for too long. Struggling to fall asleep might create a negative association between where you sleep and not being able to sleep. It’s always recommended to create a good sleeping environment and reduce distractions e.g. noise level (earplugs might help with that) and intensity of the light.

The duration of sleep and when we should go to sleep are largely related to genetics. Some people feel sleepy at 10pm while some people prefer to sleep around midnight. In general, regularity is important. Having a regular time you go to sleep will help your body to set the internal clock and increase the quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It's highly unlikely that the replication will get out of control. Our bodies have evolved over time to efficiently detect foreign RNA (as this is how a lot of viruses attack cells) so while the saRNA gives slightly longer expression than mRNA, it still gets shut down eventually (within 30 days in mice). Increasing the time that the RNA exists in the cells is the perpetual uphill battle of the field of RNA delivery. Even if it did replicate infinitely, it just means that it would continuously produce the encoded protein as opposed to turning back into a replicating virus or something. \n2. You’re correct that normally specific immune cells develop the antibodies (called B cells). Our RNA actually doesn’t encode the antibodies directly, just a protein from the surface of the virus, called spike. Thus, the mechanisms of immune response are similar to a normal vaccine: once your cells make the spike protein other cells take it up, chop it up and then tell B cells to make antibodies against it. However, you’re correct in that we are hijacking the cellular function to make our protein, in addition to the normal proteins. Luckily, cells are quite efficient at pumping out proteins, so they are able to cope with the extra burden. From what we’ve seen, the RNA gets into relatively few cells (again, we’re highly evolved to resist foreign RNA) so only a small subset of your cells are impacted and there’s not a systemic effect.\n3. As I mentioned above, the RNA is detected as foreign. This actually works as an advantage for RNA vaccines though- because your body has detected a foreign RNA, it enters an antiviral state, and then when it makes the spike protein this is what helps stimulate an immune response to it. If you got a massive dose of RNA and enough cells in your body were in this antiviral state it could weaken your immune response to a pathogen, but we use relatively low doses of RNA (0.1-10 µg in our trial) so this isn’t nearly enough to observe systemic effects against the RNA. \n\nHope this helps, and happy to continue the conversation if you have any follow-up questions!",

For SARS-CoV-2, like most viruses, it will likely be a combination. The problem with allowing the virus to run rampant is that the immunity may not be long-lasting (for other coronaviruses the antibodies usually stick around for 3-6 months) so the population may never get to a level where everyone has a protective amount of antibodies, and instead everyone is just repeatedly getting sick. In addition, we know very little about the short- and long-term effects of this virus since it’s brand new, so we’d prefer to have a way to prevent people from getting infected in the first place, hence a vaccine!",

Humans and mice have different immune systems and respond differently to the same vaccine, so this is one of the main things we’re looking at in our clinical trial.

At this point, it’s hard to know exactly what antibody levels are required to prevent infection or lessen the severity of the diseases (called the ‘correlate of protection’), so all we can do in the meantime is compare it to a natural infection. As vaccine candidates progress through clinical trials, we’ll have a better idea of what these levels are. \n\nIf everyone on the planet were to receive a 100% effective COVID vaccine with long-lasting immunity tomorrow, we would of course have herd immunity! I do think we’ll get there eventually, but it depends on a number of different factors: how long the immunity lasts, how accessible the vaccines are (cost and availability), if the virus mutates, how quickly we’re able to scale-up production once a vaccine is licensed, etc. We’re passionate about making our vaccine accessible to as many people as possible, especially in low- and middle-income countries that may not have vaccine programs of their own, which was our reason for starting VacEquity.",

As for how much it would need to mutate to render a vaccine ineffective, it’s hard to say! Our vaccine, like other candidates in development, targets only a certain protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 called the ‘spike protein’, so this is the most concerning area for mutations. So far, there’s been one notable variation called the ‘D614G’ mutation in the spike protein, which is found globally. There is ongoing research to determine how this changes the conformation of the protein and the efficacy of the current iterations of the vaccine. One major advantage of our vaccine platform is that it’s quick to make a new version, so if there was a disruptive mutation and we needed to make an entirely new vaccine with a different RNA sequence, we’d be able to pivot to address this.",

        "body": "Fantastic questions! You are correct that we need both, but reducing deforestation is probably more important. This is because cutting down existing forest may release more CO2 than new forests can absorb. That statement seems highly counter-intuitive, but it has to do with the way carbon cycles among all components of the earth system – land-based ecosystems, the ocean, and the atmosphere. The ocean has absorbed a large fraction of human CO2 emissions. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations are drawn down by planting lots of trees, than the ocean will release (‘outgas’) some of the CO2 it has absorbed in the past, just as a consequence of passive gas diffusion. However, if existing forest is cut down, much of the carbon in trees and soils will be released into the atmosphere. For this reason, scientists estimate that the largest possible tree-planting program could reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 40-70 ppm, but cutting down all remaining forest would increase atmospheric CO2 by about 130-290 ppm. \n\nAt the global scale, soil holds about 1500 Pg (gigatonnes) of carbon, while plants contain 560 Pg. So there is much more carbon in the soil than in the plants themselves! This is true for every terrestrial ecosystem, but the ratio of plant carbon to soil carbon varies somewhat across the globe – it is higher in forests than grasslands, for example.\n\nReferences: House et al. 2002 *Glob Change Biol* 8: 1047-1052 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00536.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00536.x)",

This is because cutting down existing forest may release more CO2 than new forests can absorb. That statement seems highly counter-intuitive, but it has to do with the way carbon cycles among all components of the earth system – land-based ecosystems, the ocean, and the atmosphere. The ocean has absorbed a large fraction of human CO2 emissions. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations are drawn down by planting lots of trees, than the ocean will release (‘outgas’) some of the CO2 it has absorbed in the past, just as a consequence of passive gas diffusion. However, if existing forest is cut down, much of the carbon in trees and soils will be released into the atmosphere. For this reason, scientists estimate that the largest possible tree-planting program could reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 40-70 ppm, but cutting down all remaining forest would increase atmospheric CO2 by about 130-290 ppm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the global scale, soil holds about 1500 Pg (gigatonnes) of carbon, while plants contain 560 Pg. So there is much more carbon in the soil than in the plants themselves! This is true for every terrestrial ecosystem, but the ratio of plant carbon to soil carbon varies somewhat across the globe – it is higher in forests than grasslands, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;References: House et al. 2002 &lt;em&gt;Glob Change Biol&lt;/em&gt; 8: 1047-1052 &lt;a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00536.x\"&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2002.00536.x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

First, how does the organization select and obtain land on which to plant? This is critical to avoiding what are called ‘leakage’ effects, when negative environmental impacts are displaced from one area to another. As an example, if an organization purchases land that is in active use for cattle pasture, fencing it off in order to plant trees, then the farmers may have to cut down forest elsewhere to graze their cattle. So you want to look out for an organization that is well embedded in the communities where forests will be established. Second, how will the organization select which species to plant? I’d avoid any operations that use a handful of non-native, fast-growing species, as this approach is least likely to achieve environmental co-benefits. Third, what plans are in place to continue monitoring and caring for the trees as they grow? A surprisingly large number of tree-planting projects can fail if the saplings are not looked after and protected from herbivory, etc. Finally – perhaps most importantly – protecting existing forest is more beneficial to the climate than establishing new forest. So I would be careful to select an organization that acknowledges this and balances tree planting activities with strategies to promote conservation and natural regeneration.",

If the tree is converted into short-lived products (like tissue paper), we can assume that the product will soon decompose in a landfill. However, if the wood is used for very long-lived products (like timber framing for a home), it can continue to sequester carbon for as long as the building lasts.

        "body": "It does seem counter-intuitive that planting trees could increase emissions or lead to further warming! But there are several ways this could happen. I’ll outline a few below:\n\n**LOSSES OF SOIL CARBON**: We need to consider carbon not only in the bodies of trees, but also in the soil. Soil organic matter – the stuff that makes dirt brown or black – is full of carbon. In fact, soils contain more carbon than all terrestrial plants and the atmosphere combined! The amount of soil carbon reflects the balance between inputs (dead plant matter) and outputs (CO2 produced by decomposer microbes). Soil carbon ‘hotspots’ occur where decomposition is very slow, either because of the cold (permafrost) or flooding (peats and bogs). When trees are planted on peats, the soil must be drained for the trees to grow well. This triggers a large increase in the rate at which soil organic matter is decomposed, and the losses of CO2 from soil can be much greater than the gains of carbon in plant biomass.  \n\n**CHANGES IN FIRE REGIME**: Ecosystems dominated by grasses, like savannas, have evolved over millions of years to tolerate periodic fires. Planting trees too densely in these ecosystems can increase the severity of fires, and then much of the carbon captured in those trees is emitted as CO2 during a burn.\n\n**LOCAL WARMING THROUGH CHANGES IN ALBEDO**: At high latitudes (close to the poles), native vegetation is short, shrubby, and covered by snow most of the year. Snow reflects the sun’s energy back into space. As it gets warmer, it’s possible to plant trees at higher latitudes – but these trees are tall and dark, so they absorb the sun’s energy, even during the winter.\n\nReferences:\n\nFriggens et al. 2020 *Glob Change Biol* DOI: 10.1111/gcb.15229 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15229](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15229) \n\nWaring et al. 2020 DOI: 10.3389/ffgc.2020.00058\n\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00058/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00058/full)",

If you are in a deep NREM sleep, I think music will not influence dreams. But if it has a certain kind of rhythm or sound it may infiltrate into lighter stages of sleep and so it could influence your sleep. Not sure about waking up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

NREM sleep is so-called deep sleep and REM sleep is when we usually dream. NREM and REM sleep cycle for about 1.5 hours and on average we can have 5 cycles in one night. The feeling we have and our energy level depend on when exactly we wake up. If we wake up in the middle of a deep sleep (NREM sleep), we are likely to feel tired. But if we wake up when the sleep cycle is just finished, so the end of REM sleep, we usually feel refreshed. Of course the exact time of each cycle for everyone is different, if you could figure out the best duration for yourself, you can potentially reduce the chance of feeling tired after sleep.

For example, my colleague Dr Ivan Rosenzweig at King’s College London works on one such model. Sleep apnea, rather than snoring per se, tends to be a problem, because the windpipe collapses during sleep, and the person does not get enough oxygen, which then triggers an emergency response to wake up. In the long term this is probably very damaging but can be easily solved with the right kind of positive air flow mask at night. Sleep apnea and snoring will of course be a problem for your partner who will also suffer sleep deprivation. But the fact that you can sleep deeply suggests you do not have sleep apnea. People with sleep apnea tend to wake up feeling unrefreshed and are often tired throughout the day.",

For example, my colleague Dr Ivan Rosenzweig at King’s College London works on one such model. Sleep apnea, rather than snoring per se, tends to be a problem, because the windpipe collapses during sleep, and the person does not get enough oxygen, which then triggers an emergency response to wake up. In the long term this is probably very damaging but can be easily solved with the right kind of positive air flow mask at night. Sleep apnea and snoring will of course be a problem for your partner who will also suffer sleep deprivation. But the fact that you can sleep deeply suggests you do not have sleep apnea. People with sleep apnea tend to wake up feeling unrefreshed and are often tired throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That is the very thing we and other researchers are trying to investigate in mice - does long term sleep deprivation make it more likely to get dementia? We don't know the answer to this question yet. We know that short term sleep deprivation raises the levels of toxins (amyloid and tau proteins) in the brain after a night of sleep deprivation. We see this in mice and human volunteers. So the question is, what happens if you have poor sleep over decades? We don’t know to be honest. However, I do not think you would develop Alzheimer’s in your 20s and 30s even with poor sleep.

Instead, the best thing while your aunt remains healthy is to try and make sure you have very good sleep “hygiene”.

It&amp;#39;s best to use these drugs only occasionally and always with the consent of your doctor. Instead, the best thing while your aunt remains healthy is to try and make sure you have very good sleep “hygiene”. This can include going to bed at the same time every day, removing distractions around (phones, TV, light, noise etc.), taking regular exercise or starting the morning with a special daylight lamp that stimulates the circadian system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is because as the disease progresses, all parts of the brain start to be affected.

There is also a phenomenon called “sundowning” in the late afternoon or early evening, when a person with dementia may act for example, more aggressively. This has been shown to result from damage to the part of the hypothalamus that contains the circadian clock. It is interesting to consider whether poor sleep itself makes Alzheimer’s disease worse, or during the course of a lifetime makes it more likely to get the disease.

From your question I’m not sure on the exact time you go to bed. It is possible that your body clock is telling you to sleep at midnight, while you go to bed at around 10 pm for example, so it will take 2-3 hours to fall asleep. It might be helpful if you only go to bed when you actually feel sleepy instead of waiting and struggling in bed for too long. Struggling to fall asleep might create a negative association between where you sleep and not being able to sleep. It’s always recommended to create a good sleeping environment and reduce distractions e.g. noise level (earplugs might help with that) and intensity of the light. Hope you will get better sleep soon!",

This is the main reason we don’t have vaccines for other coronaviruses yet.\n2. You’re correct that reinfections with coronaviruses is common, this is due to a short-lived antibody response. Studies have shown that the antibodies usually circulate for 3-6 months after a natural infection. The goal for the vaccine is to induce a long-lasting antibody response that prevents infections, without ever being infected in the first place.

It's highly unlikely that the replication will get out of control. Our bodies have evolved over time to efficiently detect foreign RNA (as this is how a lot of viruses attack cells) so while the saRNA gives slightly longer expression than mRNA, it still gets shut down eventually (within 30 days in mice). Increasing the time that the RNA exists in the cells is the perpetual uphill battle of the field of RNA delivery. Even if it did replicate infinitely, it just means that it would continuously produce the encoded protein as opposed to turning back into a replicating virus or something. \n2. You’re correct that normally specific immune cells develop the antibodies (called B cells). Our RNA actually doesn’t encode the antibodies directly, just a protein from the surface of the virus, called spike. Thus, the mechanisms of immune response are similar to a normal vaccine: once your cells make the spike protein other cells take it up, chop it up and then tell B cells to make antibodies against it. However, you’re correct in that we are hijacking the cellular function to make our protein, in addition to the normal proteins. Luckily, cells are quite efficient at pumping out proteins, so they are able to cope with the extra burden. From what we’ve seen, the RNA gets into relatively few cells (again, we’re highly evolved to resist foreign RNA) so only a small subset of your cells are impacted and there’s not a systemic effect.\n3. As I mentioned above, the RNA is detected as foreign. This actually works as an advantage for RNA vaccines though- because your body has detected a foreign RNA, it enters an antiviral state, and then when it makes the spike protein this is what helps stimulate an immune response to it. If you got a massive dose of RNA and enough cells in your body were in this antiviral state it could weaken your immune response to a pathogen, but we use relatively low doses of RNA (0.1-10 µg in our trial) so this isn’t nearly enough to observe systemic effects against the RNA. \n\nHope this helps, and happy to continue the conversation if you have any follow-up questions!",

We have spent a lot of time making sure our vaccine candidate is safe and this will be a continuous process throughout each stage of the human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

When we inject the vaccine a small number of muscle cells will express the coronavirus spike protein but most of the immune response will take place in the draining lymph node near to the injected muscle.

We are still in the process of observing how long the antibodies persist in humans - we actually can’t answer this question directly in mice. Humans and mice have different immune systems and respond differently to the same vaccine, so this is one of the main things we’re looking at in our clinical trial. Obviously it’s more ideal for the vaccine-induced antibodies to last a long time so that people don’t need to be vaccinated as frequently, which is what we’re striving for. \n\nIn our preclinical studies, even the mice that received a dose of 0.01 µg (10 ng, tiny dose!) had antibody titers (a measurement of how much antibody an organism has produced) that were higher than patients at our local hospital that had recovered from COVID-19. At this point, it’s hard to know exactly what antibody levels are required to prevent infection or lessen the severity of the diseases (called the ‘correlate of protection’), so all we can do in the meantime is compare it to a natural infection. As vaccine candidates progress through clinical trials, we’ll have a better idea of what these levels are. \n\nIf everyone on the planet were to receive a 100% effective COVID vaccine with long-lasting immunity tomorrow, we would of course have herd immunity! I do think we’ll get there eventually, but it depends on a number of different factors: how long the immunity lasts, how accessible the vaccines are (cost and availability), if the virus mutates, how quickly we’re able to scale-up production once a vaccine is licensed, etc. We’re passionate about making our vaccine accessible to as many people as possible, especially in low- and middle-income countries that may not have vaccine programs of their own, which was our reason for starting VacEquity.",

        "body": "From Andrea: Hi /u/RealHorstOstus, it’s hard to give a clear cut answer. I’ve written a long [article](https://www.valigiablu.it/app-immuni-coronavirus-analisi/) on the topic, unfortunately it’s in Italian but I’ve been told that Google Translate and DeepL translate it very well. Anyway I’ll try and summarize the main points here. First of all, here’s a simplified description of how the protocol works:\n\n1. Every user (Bob) locally generates some random temporary IDs.\n2. Bob’s device continuously broadcasts one of these temporary IDs everywhere he goes. The broadcasted ID is replaced every \\~15 min with a new one. This is done to prevent external adversaries from linking Bob’s identifiers across time (and learning who Bob meets or where he goes through physical bluetooth sensors installed across a city or country).\n3. Every device (running the app) that observes Bob’s identifiers stores them. At the same time, Bob’s device stores all the identifiers it observes from surrounding devices.\n4. If Bob is found covid-positive, he can decide to upload the temporary IDs that he has broadcasted in the past 14 days to the central authority which controls the backend. \n5. All users’ devices regularly query the central authority to fetch the keys belonging to all covid-positive users. Note that, in principle, this does not require that the central authority knows the actual identity of any user. It’s sufficient for the authority to mark the IDs as infected and make them accessible by all users.\n6. All users’ devices regularly check the list of IDs marked as infected. If one of the IDs they have observed in the past 14 days was marked as infected, this means that the user was nearby another user who has been later tested covid-positive. So the app triggers a notification alerting the at-risk user of the exposure.\n\nThis protocol is designed to give strong privacy protections, since the central authority is not assumed to be trusted with sensitive/secret information. In particular, devices generate the temporary IDs locally and when a user is tested positive they share only their own IDs, not the ones they observed. This prevents some potential attacks that apply to centralized protocols (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/il4l7o/hi_reddit_were_privacy_researchers_we_investigate/g3q88i9) answer). On the other hand, some attacks are still possible against this decentralized protocol. \n\nThe first attack could potentially allow an attacker to infer with good confidence the identity of their contacts who later marked themselves as infected. The attack requires the attacker to install a modified app that stores the observed IDs (together with the timestamp) and makes them accessible to the user (the framework by Apple and Google doesn’t expose the stored IDs to the user, at least for non-rooted devices). Since the list of IDs marked as infected is essentially public, the malicious app can easily check which of the observed IDs are marked as infected. The attacker can then check at which time he/she was nearby an infected user, and could use this information to identify this user.\n\nA second attack would allow to track people’s movements, but this requires the attacker to control a network of Bluetooth sensors. Crucially, this attack works only for positive users who share their IDs with the central authority and only for up to 14 days. However, a nasty aspect of this attack is that the attacker does not need to control the backend, so the attack could in principle be executed by any resourceful actor such as adversary states or terrorist groups. Here’s how the attack works. When a user is found positive, their IDs for the previous 14 days are made public. Moreover, all IDs used  in an interval of 24 hours are “grouped” together (this is for technical reasons related to reducing the size of the data). Thus we get 14 groups each containing all the IDs that were broadcasted by the user during the same day. In turn, this means that all IDs used by the same user across 24h become *linkable*. So, an attacker that controls a network of Bluetooth sensors can use this to track this user across locations if the user gets close to the sensors. Now, the trajectories obtained are pseudonymous, they’re not explicitly linked to a specific identity. But research published by our group back in 2013 shows that these trajectories are typically very easy to re-identify. The [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376) shows that 95% of the time, only 4 points (location and time) in a trajectory are enough to re-identify a person uniquely in a dataset with millions of users. These 4 points constitute what we technically call *auxiliary information* or *background knowledge*. The attacker could, for example, know the home and workplace of most individuals, so that’s already 2 points. The additional 2 points could be collected by cross-linking other data such as credit card purchases or tap-in/out events with personal cards in public transport (the specific auxiliary information that is reasonably available depends on the attacker). Once a trajectory is identified, the attacker can of course infer every place that the user has visited by looking at the other locations in the trajectory (as long as it was observed by one of the BT sensors). It’s worth pointing out that the network of BT sensors could be replaced by a botnet of smartphones infected with malware. While spreading malware at large scale is far from easy, research from my group [showed](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/blog/cambridge-analytica-is-only-the-beginning/) that in a densely populated city like London, controlling just 1% of people’s devices would allow to observe 56% of all users.\n\nThese attacks are what I consider the main ones, but other potential vulnerabilities have been discussed (see e.g. [this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/531) paper). In my opinion, these attacks look quite complicated and unlikely, especially if one considers the type and limited amount of data that the attacker would collect. Most of them work only on users who are tested positive and decide to share their IDs, and only for a period of up to 14 days. However, for some people (especially activists, journalists, government-level people, etc) they might constitute a real risk. That’s why I think it’s important that researchers continue to study contact tracing protocols and propose solutions that are even safer than the one currently deployed by Apple and Google.",

While spreading malware at large scale is far from easy, research from my group &lt;a href=\"https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/blog/cambridge-analytica-is-only-the-beginning/\"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that in a densely populated city like London, controlling just 1% of people’s devices would allow to observe 56% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These attacks are what I consider the main ones, but other potential vulnerabilities have been discussed (see e.g. &lt;a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/531\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper). In my opinion, these attacks look quite complicated and unlikely, especially if one considers the type and limited amount of data that the attacker would collect. Most of them work only on users who are tested positive and decide to share their IDs, and only for a period of up to 14 days. However, for some people (especially activists, journalists, government-level people, etc) they might constitute a real risk. That’s why I think it’s important that researchers continue to study contact tracing protocols and propose solutions that are even safer than the one currently deployed by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

From what I know, digital contact tracing is only supposed to complement traditional contact tracing (useful because people might get close to people they don’t know or don’t remember).  Of course, digital Bluetooth or location-based contact tracing can be difficult to do properly, and indeed requires a large fraction of the population to use the apps before bending down the spread of coronavirus. I talked a bit about that on Twitter back in April ([https://twitter.com/cynddl/status/1254391597158072320](https://twitter.com/cynddl/status/1254391597158072320)).

I don’t think civilian GPS can provide enough accuracy to accurately pinpoint if you are in a cafe, in the bathroom of the cafe, talking to someone, alone on your bike in front of the cafe, etc. As for Bluetooth technologies, there are inherent discrepancies between devices, brands, wall penetration, noise sensitivity, etc. Not all contact-tracing protocols seem to take that into account.

If you look at our article [on the privacy-conscientious use of mobile phone data](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018286), we discuss how modern data processing can help balance technically the need to use our data for good and our legitimate privacy concerns. Regarding synthetic data, it’s definitely a promising direction, with some limits in terms of data utility and re-identification or inference risks, see e.g. [Hayes et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07663.pdf) who proposed in 2018 a membership inference attack (can I predict who participated in the training data) against generative data.",

MIT Technology Review is doing a great job at [tracking](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/) contact tracing apps. Their database includes whether the data is supposed to be destroyed. As for the right to erasure, that must be guaranteed for apps deployed in EU countries due to GDPR. However, it’s important to note that most of these apps use pseudonymous data that is quite hard to link to a specific person. This means that it would be very difficult for a user to prove that some data belongs to them and ask to delete it. However, I would say that in most cases for contact tracing apps this is a good thing. Many protocols are designed in a way that tries to make data really anonymous from a *technical* perspective, minimizing the requirement for *trust* in the authority that controls the system and collects the data. This is one of the most important goals of privacy-enhancing technologies: it’s hard to completely remove the need for trust, but such technologies can greatly reduce it.\n\nAnother important role is played at the legal level by data protection authorities. The EU has tried to set some important [principles](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_669) regarding privacy and freedom in contact tracing systems, which address many of the points you raised (including limits and security of data storage and user control over data). - Andrea",

I don’t think Bayesian statistics have received much traction in re-identification science and privacy research.

We didn’t specifically look in the details of the Aarogya Setu app. But in my understanding according to the [Aarogya Setu’s privacy policy](https://web.swaraksha.gov.in/ncv19/privacy/) and the [open-sourced code](https://github.com/nic-delhi/AarogyaSetu_Android) of the Android App is that:\n\n1. It relies on Bluetooth and location data to perform contact tracing.\n2. The app uses a centralised protocol where your device identifier and all the devices encountered, along with your location traces, are uploaded to the server in the event you test positive.\n3. Curiously, the app uses a fixed Bluetooth identifier that does not change with time. This is different from some [other centralized](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/stopcovid) apps that use ephemeral IDs instead.\n\nFrom what I understand, their approach could have two weak points:\n\n1. Using one fixed identifier per user makes them potentially trackable, e.g., by installing physical Bluetooth eavesdropper sensors at various locations. Since the identifier is fixed, this could be done by anyone who can install a “dense enough” network of sensors. The eavesdropper wouldn’t know directly the identity of the user linked to the trajectory. However, [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376) from our group shows that these trajectories can be easily re-identified (see the details in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/il4l7o/hi_reddit_were_privacy_researchers_we_investigate/g3q88i9/) answer). \n2. For a user who has uploaded their data to the server, the central server has complete information of the locations the user has been to, and the devices they have encountered.\n\nThe problem with collecting location data is that it is extremely sensitive information with potential for abuse. On the positive side, [the privacy policy](https://web.swaraksha.gov.in/ncv19/privacy/) reports a limit on how long the data is stored on the server. Data of the user who has not tested positive is destroyed within 45 days of being uploaded, while for users who tested positive it is destroyed 60 days after the user is declared cured. Of course, this relies on trust.\n\nIf you want to further evaluate the app, we have listed down [8 privacy questions](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/blog/evaluating-contact-tracing-apps-here-are-8-privacy-questions-we-think-you-should-ask/) that could help you.  \nFinally, Aarogya Setu’s Android app was open-sourced on Github in late May. But the repository hasn’t seen any new commits since 1st June, while the latest version was released on 8th July 2020 on the play store. Additionally, the Aarogya Setu source code does not support verifiable builds which makes it difficult to check if the code running on the deployed app is the same as the one on GitHub. The server code for the app is not yet public.",

        "body": "From Andrea: Hard question! I’ll do my best to answer clearly. The centralized protocol for digital contact tracing has attracted quite a lot of criticism because of the supposed lack of privacy protections. In reality, I think that *most* BLE-based proposals (whether centralized or decentralized) are an honest attempt at building a system that provides good privacy guarantees. The problem is that when you are deploying a system which is supposed to be adopted by millions of people, good intentions are not enough to guarantee that the system will not be abused *in the future*. That’s why it’s important that the system minimizes as much as possible the risk of *function creep*, meaning that it’s hard to use the proposed infrastructure for other goals such as mass surveillance. Most centralized protocols are vulnerable to some attacks that could *potentially* be useful for function creep. Here’s a quick summary of how most centralized protocols work:\n\n1. Every user (Bob) is assigned some random ephemeral IDs by the central authority.\n2. Bob’s device continuously broadcasts one of these ephemeral IDs everywhere he goes. The broadcast ID is replaced every \\~15 min with a new one. This is done to prevent external adversaries from linking Bob’s identifiers across time (and learning who Bob meets or where he goes through physical sensors in a city).\n3. Every device (running the app) that observes Bob’s identifiers stores them. At the same time, Bob’s device stores all the identifiers it observes from surrounding devices.\n4. If Bob is found covid-positive, he can decide to upload to the central authority the ephemeral IDs that he has observed in the past 14 days. These users have potentially been exposed to the virus, so they must be notified of the risk.\n5. The central authority looks at the identifiers uploaded by Bob and notifies directly the users that are linked to those identifiers. In principle, this does not require that the central authority knows the actual identity of these users. It’s sufficient for the authority to be able to notify them based on their ephemeral IDs.\n\nThe main problem with this protocol is that the central authority can link the different ephemeral IDs broadcast by the same user. Technically, we say that users are *pseudonymous* wrt the central authority. So, if the central authority (which could be the government) decides to install Bluetooth sensors all over the country, they can use this to track every user across locations for the whole duration of the program. Now, the trajectories obtained are pseudonymous, they’re not explicitly linked to a specific identity. But research published by our group back in 2013 shows that these trajectories are typically very easy to re-identify. The [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376) shows that 95% of the time, only 4 points (location and time) in a trajectory are enough to re-identify a person uniquely in a dataset with millions of users. These 4 points constitute what we technically call *auxiliary information* or *background knowledge*. The central authority would likely know the home and workplace of most individuals, so that’s already 2 points. The additional 2 points could be easily collected by cross-linking data such as credit card purchases or tap-in/out events with personal cards in public transport. Once a trajectory is identified, the central authority can of course infer every place that the user has visited and will visit as long as the app is used.\n\nAnother problem with the centralized protocol is that covid-positive users upload not only their own identifiers, but all the identifiers that they have observed for the past 14 days. This means that the central authority could build a partial *social graph* of the population, i.e. an approximate representation of who meets whom and when. Again, this social graph is pseudonymous. However, there’s [research](https://www.usenix.org/node/190969) [showing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak09.pdf) [that](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1276) pseudonymous social graphs can be re-identified in some cases. Together with the location-based re-identification attack above, this is an additional potential risk for privacy.\n\nThese attacks are clearly not straightforward, but are in principle possible. From a privacy perspective, it would of course be better to have contact tracing systems that are not vulnerable to such attacks.\n\nAs for the last part of your question, it’s hard to foresee which technologies governments and organizations will propose in the future. In my opinion, data protection authorities will play a crucial role to ensure that measures are proportionate and necessary. On the tech side, it’s important that privacy researchers show that privacy-preserving (enough) technologies to fight the pandemic *are* possible. We must do everything to reject the view that there’s a conflict between privacy and health.\n\nPS: The UK has decided to drop the centralized app and [switch](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53095336) to the decentralized protocol proposed by Apple and Google.",

        "body": "James: for me it’s fortunately been easy as I don’t have to travel much and do almost entirely desk-based work - a key trick is to learn to say no when people ask you to go to places if you can avoid it however tempting it might be to accept!  If you’re open to moving to a new location, but then being fixed there for a good stable chunk of time it should be fine in combination with desk-based research.  If you need something close to where you’re currently living then that very much depends on whether you have a good university or other conservation-focused organisation with an acceptable commuting distance of where you are - if yes then I think you can make it work for desk-based conservation projects.  The one thing to be aware of if you’re going down the academic path specifically is that when you’re a postdoc the opportunities that work best for your career might be anywhere so a restriction on the location would narrow the field of possible jobs you could apply for. \n\nRikki: Stable home life? What is such a thing?! I guess I’ve been lucky (or unlucky) in the fact that I have very few responsibilities at home to require much of a balance. As James says, learning to say no when you have your dream job with dream opportunities is an essential skill and one that I am still trying to learn. There are plenty of career options that provide much more geographically stable work, as James says, particularly if you pursue an academic route.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;James: for me it’s fortunately been easy as I don’t have to travel much and do almost entirely desk-based work - a key trick is to learn to say no when people ask you to go to places if you can avoid it however tempting it might be to accept!  If you’re open to moving to a new location, but then being fixed there for a good stable chunk of time it should be fine in combination with desk-based research.  If you need something close to where you’re currently living then that very much depends on whether you have a good university or other conservation-focused organisation with an acceptable commuting distance of where you are - if yes then I think you can make it work for desk-based conservation projects.  The one thing to be aware of if you’re going down the academic path specifically is that when you’re a postdoc the opportunities that work best for your career might be anywhere so a restriction on the location would narrow the field of possible jobs you could apply for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rikki: Stable home life? What is such a thing?! I guess I’ve been lucky (or unlucky) in the fact that I have very few responsibilities at home to require much of a balance. As James says, learning to say no when you have your dream job with dream opportunities is an essential skill and one that I am still trying to learn. There are plenty of career options that provide much more geographically stable work, as James says, particularly if you pursue an academic route. There are also plenty of roles within conservation organisations that do not require much, if any, international travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Perhaps the event that had the most impact on my being in this field was volunteering for a field trip to the topics in 2nd year undergrad.  This is what persuaded me to change field and go into ecology / conservation.  Having said all this, I’ve found that the few words said to me in chance meetings at scientific conferences have perhaps had an even more profound impact in what I’ve ended up studying and how I’ve found the strength to continue with it during more difficult times.  \n2. As for funny stories - Rikki is full of those having done many conservation field trips around the globe.  I am less so - as a purely computational biologist you’re more likely to hear about that time when I discovered a bug in my code and stayed late to fix it.   I suppose I can do a bit better than that….. I wanted to find a particular species of plant in Malaysia, it was apparently easy if you know where to look, but no success from the instructions after spending a whole day trekking around the most difficult landscapes.  I had all but given up and was waiting to get the bus back when I had a sudden change of heart, ran back to the village got a car and a guide and tried again - many hours later after wading through rivers and making calls to rangers and such, we finally got to the correct location and saw it - in the verge at the side of the road all along….\n\nRikki: great question!\n\n1. It’s really hard to pinpoint just one moment that has had the most profound impact on me. One that stands out is my visit to Madagascar. Having read about the amazing diversity of the island, from lemurs to chameleons, and frogs to a now extinct (apparently!) hippo, and also having a vague understanding of the dire situation for the native wildlife, I was excited to get to the island and see it firsthand. However, nothing prepared me for the 10-hour drive from the capital, Tana, to our field station in Ranomafana. The scale of forest loss was suffocating and it profoundly affected me and my optimism for the future of not only Madagascar’s wildlife and people but for all of us. It definitely opened my eyes to just how urgently we need to act and has driven me forward ever since.\n2. Haha - I can’t say I’ve ever tried to help a penguin lay an egg! Eggs do seem to feature in a lot of my stories, though. Again, it’s hard to pick a favourite story - especially one that won’t be heavily edited by our comms team!!\\* In terms of ridiculousness - this one was self-inflicted: there was one night in central Ghana - I was visiting the project of an EDGE Fellow (the early career conservationists we support) in a small rural village alongside a small river. However, in the rainy season this small river floods and becomes a vast swamp that engulfs the river and its small stream-like tributaries, along with the surrounding raffia palm and plantation forest. Each footstep in the swamp is uncertain: am I still on the bank of the river, where the water reaches only to my waist? Or am I about to step into a deep pool, carrying all of my kit in my rucksack, in the pitch dark? Every so often our headlamps would pick up the shine from a crocodile’s eyes a few metres ahead (or behind us) as we continue through the swamp, falling, flailing, stumbling in the murky water, counting the crocodiles as we go. When we reached a deep section of the swamp, we would use raffia palm leaves to build makeshift bridges in an attempt to cross. Now, as anyone who has seen me try and cross even the smallest stream can attest (my boss once had to virtually carry me across a 30-cm-deep stream, much to the amusement of our Colombian colleagues) standing on a submerged raffia palm in wellington boots with a soggy rucksack is not my forte. And I’m slipping every five minutes. All of a sudden, I notice something strange. In this dark world of palms and water and crocodile eyes, there isn’t much in the way of landmarks to find our way. But I SWEAR I’ve seen that tree before! After much deliberation and passing around of the GPS we discovered that, at the end of our survey, we had taken a wrong turn and proceeded to go in circles for almost two hours in the hot, humid and wet swamp, fighting mosquitoes and avoiding crocodiles! Let’s just say we laughed a lot...once we were back at camp.\n\n\\*From the comms team - don't worry, we didn't edit a thing! ;)",

It is hard to pinpoint one single thing people around the world can do for this particular species other than being part of a global transformative change in the way we live and consume natural resources.

Health systems are faced with difficult choices in allocating resources and cybersecurity investment is not always seen as a priority when dealing with issues such as COVID-19 or cancer care. When budgets are pressing, one of the most cost-effective ways is to ensure that all healthcare staff are aware of cyber issues and have effective training in place so that they can help protect the system. The ‘insider’ threat is often seen as one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity in healthcare, so this is super important to address.\n\nYou can read our recent blog that gives simple steps healthcare staff can take towards better cyber resilience here: [https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/blog/ighi/2020/06/10/healthcare-cybersecurity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-threat-too-important-to-forget/](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/blog/ighi/2020/06/10/healthcare-cybersecurity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-threat-too-important-to-forget/)\n\nAnd another handy resource is the National Cybersecurity Centre's 'Home working: preparing your organisation and staff' guidance: [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/home-working](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/home-working)\n\nAnd for anyone in the US, the American Medical Association also has some advice on 'Working from home during COVID-19 pandemic ': [https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2020-04/cybersecurity-work-from-home-covid-19.pdf](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2020-04/cybersecurity-work-from-home-covid-19.pdf)",

The ‘insider’ threat is often seen as one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity in healthcare, so this is super important to address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can read our recent blog that gives simple steps healthcare staff can take towards better cyber resilience here: &lt;a href=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/blog/ighi/2020/06/10/healthcare-cybersecurity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-threat-too-important-to-forget/\"&gt;https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/blog/ighi/2020/06/10/healthcare-cybersecurity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-threat-too-important-to-forget/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And another handy resource is the National Cybersecurity Centre&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Home working: preparing your organisation and staff&amp;#39; guidance: &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/home-working\"&gt;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/home-working&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for anyone in the US, the American Medical Association also has some advice on &amp;#39;Working from home during COVID-19 pandemic &amp;#39;: &lt;a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2020-04/cybersecurity-work-from-home-covid-19.pdf\"&gt;https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2020-04/cybersecurity-work-from-home-covid-19.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Your question gets at a really important consideration for digital mental healthcare – how to ensure that tools developed, and support provided, cover the space of all relevant needs. One platform or tool cannot do everything. But we need to ensure that we cater for needs that, for example, help to prevent mental health issues developing, provide timely and appropriate treatment, or monitor symptoms to detect relapse or deterioration. \n\nWe need to consider the needs of different people, communities, resource settings and conditions. We also need innovations to integrate with the mental healthcare system in general, so there is a suite of care available. Experts sometimes raise the issue of having too much focus on 'wellbeing apps' etc, while we need to develop better digital support for more complex and severe mental health difficulties – though there are great evidence-based examples out there, and more is being done.\n\nTo answer your specific question, if an individual requires support beyond or different from talk therapies or CBT, there are a range of ways digital could help. For example, tracking their mood, behaviour and symptoms and providing information to a clinician, even to monitor the effects of medications for example, or through tools and platforms that use other techniques. \n\nSome researchers are developing new technologies that can monitor but also detect when that person is at an immediate risk. At that point they would receive immediate help – this is in line with young people’s needs. What this help looks like is still being explored – but it could involve automated flagging to crisis teams. It’s important to stress that  digital tools are not an alternative to emergency help, but can help bridge digital and in-person management. If someone is identified as being an immediate risk of hurting themselves or others, it is most important to call emergency services.",

        "body": "Emma and Lindsay: \n\nHi. Thanks for this question. Everyone is understandably concerned about coronavirus at the moment. As we move to the next stage of responding to the pandemic, we’re seeing an increasing focus on supporting people with their mental health and wellbeing. For example, some great links include this one from the [Mental Health Foundation](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/looking-after-your-mental-health-during-coronavirus-outbreak) and this from the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf). There are numerous ways that digital tools can help us all through this period, including to maintain social connection even with social distancing. Today for example, Lindsay reached out to her family and arranged a Skype video call to be set up on a regular basis so that we can still “see each other” even though it’s not face-to-face. \n\nOne potential difficulty for those experiencing health anxiety at the moment is the access to 24/7 digital information and updates about the pandemic. WHO advice is to:  \"Minimize watching, reading or listening to news that causes you to feel anxious or distressed; seek information only from trusted sources and mainly to take practical steps to prepare your plans and protect yourself and loved ones. Seek information updates at specific times during the day, once or twice. The sudden and near-constant stream of news reports about an outbreak can cause anyone to feel worried. Get the facts; not the rumours and misinformation.\"\n\nThere are also recommended apps that can help all aspects of our wellbeing, including getting a good night’s sleep, feeling more relaxed, and improving our mood. For example, [CALM](https://www.calm.com/) is an app that focuses on helping people to relax through breathing, relaxation exercises and meditation, and [SLEEPIO](https://www.bighealth.com/sleepio) is an evidence-based online intervention that is a personalised guided journey to better sleep. If you are in the UK and are feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or isolated through this difficult time, text SHOUT to 85258 (and if you are in the US you can text 741 741 for Crisis Text Line).",

If you are in the UK and are feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or isolated through this difficult time, text SHOUT to 85258 (and if you are in the US you can text 741 741 for Crisis Text Line).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The service is powered by volunteers trained in crisis support who are all clinically supervised in real-time on the platform.\n\nSHOUT has been extremely well-received so far. We have continuously growing volumes, with over 250,000 conversations to date, and are clearly meeting a need in the community. As a start, we evaluate success largely based on our user feedback following a conversation, which currently tells us that people most appreciate being listened to and understood when struggling through a difficult time. Volunteers also complete a post-conversation survey, which helps us to identify commonly experienced difficulties. The goal is to learn from those directly so we can better help others. And very excitingly, SHOUT is in partnership with Imperial College London to evaluate the use of its service. \n\nIn terms of \"an important topic in these times\", there have been rapidly rising rates of SHOUT conversations mentioning \"virus\" – understandably, the current pandemic is contributing to feelings of anxiety, overwhelm, isolation, and loneliness for many. SHOUT is fully operational to offer support any time of the day or night, from volunteers and clinical supervisors working remotely, so it’s an important service for current needs.",

        "body": "Hi Forgiii, thanks for your question. Paramedics are a vital first line with heart attacks, and what you do has been designed to give people the best chance until they can get to the catheter lab in the hospital.

        "body": "Thanks for your question.\n\nI think it is always crucial to develop alternatives to existing technologies. Aluminium-air batteries appear to have promising theoretical energy densities, and even though commercialisation seems unlikely to me (see below), development of this technology could lead to insights useful to further improve existing technologies, or serve as alternative in case a show-stopper is reached for existing technologies (lack of material). \n\nIn terms of commercialisation, I am cautious, because time from lab-to-market usually takes 10 - 20 years. Lithium-ion batteries have already achieved a huge cost and performance advantage and will continue to do so driven by the electrification of transport. So, the only chance for aluminium-air lies in a breakthrough that is always uncertain to achieve, but never impossible.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it is always crucial to develop alternatives to existing technologies. Aluminium-air batteries appear to have promising theoretical energy densities, and even though commercialisation seems unlikely to me (see below), development of this technology could lead to insights useful to further improve existing technologies, or serve as alternative in case a show-stopper is reached for existing technologies (lack of material). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of commercialisation, I am cautious, because time from lab-to-market usually takes 10 - 20 years. Lithium-ion batteries have already achieved a huge cost and performance advantage and will continue to do so driven by the electrification of transport. So, the only chance for aluminium-air lies in a breakthrough that is always uncertain to achieve, but never impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Excellent question. \n\nI see three angles to your question:\n\n1. **What’s the role of alternatives to storage?**\n2. **If storage, does it have to be large-scale?**\n3. **If large-scale storage, does it have to be batteries?**\n\n**About 1.** \n\nThe options to provide flexibility in low-carbon power systems are:\n\n1. Demand-side response, i.e. shift demand if possible\n2. Transmission, i.e. connect regions to leverage differences in solar and wind resources\n3. Flexible generation, i.e. gas-fired power stations \n4. Energy storage\n\nSome research suggests that energy storage at current cost is the most expensive option and should be considered last. [https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2921](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2921)\n\nI would definitely argue that demand-side response appears to be the cheapest option and should be considered first. For example, researchers at Imperial found that industrial cooling constitutes 2 GW of UK demand (7.5% of average demand). That’s mostly for large warehouses of the main supermarket chains. The usual way refrigerators work is to maintain the necessary temperature range by cooling down to the lowest point and then being idle until the highest acceptable temperature is reached. However, it does not have to be that rigid. As long as the target temperature range is maintained, the cooling can be made flexible. This does not cost much, but makes 2 GW of demand available to accommodate for uncertainty or short-term variability of renewable generation. So, demand response should be considered as much as possible. \n\nTransmission expansion also has large potentials to account for the variability in renewable energy generation, in particular for wind: [https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3338](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3338)\n\nHowever, it can get very costly to build new transmission lines. Public opposition in Germany has led to the decision to build the necessary transmission that is supposed to bring wind power from the North to the industrial centers in the south underground. \n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-power-idUSL5N0YF0HP20150524](https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-power-idUSL5N0YF0HP20150524)\n\nFlexible generation is what balances the power grid today. Here the challenge is to decarbonise flexible generation, for example through carbon capture and storage.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent question. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see three angles to your question:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the role of alternatives to storage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If storage, does it have to be large-scale?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If large-scale storage, does it have to be batteries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About 1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The options to provide flexibility in low-carbon power systems are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demand-side response, i.e. shift demand if possible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transmission, i.e. connect regions to leverage differences in solar and wind resources&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexible generation, i.e. gas-fired power stations &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Energy storage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some research suggests that energy storage at current cost is the most expensive option and should be considered last. &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2921\"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2921&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would definitely argue that demand-side response appears to be the cheapest option and should be considered first. For example, researchers at Imperial found that industrial cooling constitutes 2 GW of UK demand (7.5% of average demand). That’s mostly for large warehouses of the main supermarket chains. The usual way refrigerators work is to maintain the necessary temperature range by cooling down to the lowest point and then being idle until the highest acceptable temperature is reached. However, it does not have to be that rigid. As long as the target temperature range is maintained, the cooling can be made flexible. This does not cost much, but makes 2 GW of demand available to accommodate for uncertainty or short-term variability of renewable generation. So, demand response should be considered as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transmission expansion also has large potentials to account for the variability in renewable energy generation, in particular for wind: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3338\"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3338&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it can get very costly to build new transmission lines. Public opposition in Germany has led to the decision to build the necessary transmission that is supposed to bring wind power from the North to the industrial centers in the south underground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-power-idUSL5N0YF0HP20150524\"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-power-idUSL5N0YF0HP20150524&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flexible generation is what balances the power grid today. Here the challenge is to decarbonise flexible generation, for example through carbon capture and storage. This, however, also appears to be very costly, largely due to the inexperience with the technology and the challenges associated to store the CO2 safely. As a result, the UK cancelled CCS projects in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition\"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I would argue that all flexibility options must be considered and then be judged based on the three key decision factors for energy systems, economic cost, environmental sustainability, energy security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to the other options, energy storage seems to benefit from its modularity and versatility.

        "body": "The 100 million dollar question! :) \n\nLet me frame it differently to answer it properly: \n\nThere are five principles to store electricity, each with a number of technologies:\n\n1. Electrochemical (li-ion, flow, ...)\n2. Mechanical (pumped hydro, …, uphill trains!)\n3. Electrical (capacitors, ...)\n4. Chemical (hydrogen, synthetic natural gas, ...)\n5. Thermal (pumped heat, liquid air, ...)\n\nThe key cost and performance parameters of these technologies are\n\n* Capital cost\n   * Energy cost - cost for components that store the energy, i.e. water reservoir \n   * Power cost - cost for components that provide the energy, i.e. turbines / pumps\n* Lifetime:\n   * Relative to performed cycles, i.e. cycle life\n   * Relative to years of operation, i.e. shelf life\n* Round-trip efficiency\n\nAt the same time, there are three application types with multiple subcategories\n\n1. Consumer electronics (radios, phones, laptops, …)\n2. Transport (full-electric vehicle, hybrid vehicle, ...)\n3. Stationary (frequency response, peak shaving, seasonal storage, ...)\n\nMain differentiation criteria between these application types and their subcategories are\n\n* the required size (power #kW, energy #kWh)\n* how long energy must be provided at full power (hours per discharge or energy-to-power ratio)\n* the number of discharges per year (frequency of discharges or cycles)\n\nElectrochemical solutions receive a lot of attention, because they are modular, i.e. can be built in any size, and location-independent, i.e. can be built anywhere. In addition, they have favourable cost and performance parameters for the majority of applications (1-8 hours of discharge, 50-500 annual cycles). \n\nIn particular for lithium-ion, its modularity has resulted in significant cost reductions over the past 30 years. The technology started to be used in consumer electronics in the 90s resulting in impressive ‘learning effects’ for the technology due to manufacturing scale-up, R&amp;D investments, etc. Resulting cost reductions were such that lithium-ion battery packs are now considered for electric vehicles, leading to even more ‘learning effects’. The ongoing and projected cost reductions due to these additional learning effects make lithium-ion systems a potential option for stationary storage. \n\nFlow batteries compared to other electrochemical options have the advantage that cost for energy and power components are fully independent. The technology could therefore benefit from scaling effects when increasing discharge duration, i.e. applications with &gt;4 hours discharge requirements like off-grid communities. Here, cost reductions are not that significant though, because flow batteries could not ‘learn’ in the consumer electronics or transport market and are currently still too expensive for stationary applications. \n\nSo, what’s the actual situation in the stationary storage market: \n\nFirst of all, pumped hydro storage represents about 95% of globally installed stationary storage capacity. While its location-dependence and lack of modularity is a disadvantage, it will continue to play a significant role. \n\nNevertheless, in my latest research I find that the projected cost reductions for lithium-ion make it more competitive on a levelized cost of storage basis, i.e. cost of a kWh electricity discharged from the storage device, which accounts for all relevant cost and performance parameters.\n\n[https://www.storage-lab.com/levelized-cost-of-storage](https://www.storage-lab.com/levelized-cost-of-storage)\n\n**And now the actual answer to your question:**\n\nAlternative technologies could complement at very high cycle requirements due to better lifetime than lithium-ion, i.e. flywheels and supercapacitors for frequency response, and at very high discharge duration requirements, i.e. hydrogen and pumped hydro for seasonal storage (you can see that in Figure 2 following the link above)\n\nThat’s because electrical and mechanical storage technologies (potentially also thermal) tend to have better lifetimes than electrochemical ones. Chemical and mechanical storage technologies tend to exhibit lower cost for storing the actual energy, i.e. energy cost component.  \n\nIn addition to high discharge duration and discharge frequency applications, there are scale effects. While the modularity of electrochemical technologies means an increase in size will not result in a significant decrease in relative cost, mechanical, chemical and thermal technologies will benefit from scale effects. I touch on this in a recent blog that is focussed on a novel mechanical storage technology. \n\n[https://granthaminstitute.com/2018/07/09/gravity-the-solution-to-energy-storage/](https://granthaminstitute.com/2018/07/09/gravity-the-solution-to-energy-storage/)\n\nFinally, chemical and thermal technologies could complement electrochemical ones by going beyond electricity-in and electricity-out and coupling the electricity network to the fuel and heat networks. They would thereby make renewable energy from wind and solar available also in these sectors. For example, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity could be re-electrified, but it could also be used for transport (fuel cell vehicles) or heating (gas boiler, fuel cell). A thermal storage technology that would store renewable electricity as heat, could use this heat for re-electrification or to directly heat industrial processes or homes. \n\nThere seem to be large synergy potentials by coupling different energy sectors from a whole system perspective. By offering energy storage at the coupling points, chemical and thermal storage would complement electrochemical storage for pure electricity storage purposes. ",

        "body": "This is a good question - many thanks, fikis.\n\nFirstly, it’s important to clarify that we are researchers at Imperial College London and our research is independent. My PhD is funded by the UK Government Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Our research has not received funding from any palm oil companies.\n\nIt seems to me that there are two parts to this question.\n\nThe first relates to self-regulation and the absence of - or avoidance of - more stringent regulations from government.\n\nThe second relates to the legitimacy of private-sector initiatives, given that financial interests can conflict with environmental objectives (the “fox guarding the hen house” problem).\n\n***On the first point: self-regulation to avoid government regulation***\n\nSelf-regulation of palm oil production emerged as a consequence of the perceived inadequacy of government regulation by NGOs in the early 2000s. As such, self-regulation by the private sector was largely driven by concerned NGOs, not by companies seeking to avoid government regulation. For example, the RSPO was established in 2004 following activism by [WWF beginning in 2002](https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/abs/2005/02/ocl2005122p125/ocl2005122p125.html). The mass adoption of zero-deforestation commitments by palm oil companies was largely driven by campaigns by Greenpeace and other NGOs between 2007-2010 (see [Greenpeace’s ‘Cooking the Climate’ report](https://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/cooking-the-climate-full/)).\n\nSo no, self-regulation does not appear to have been an attempt by industry to avoid government regulation.\n\nIt is widely accepted that self-regulation by the private sector is not a substitute for effective regulation by government (for a detailed discussion, see [Lambin *et al.*, *Global Environmental Change*, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001125)). There remains an urgent need for improved government regulation and law enforcement in palm oil-producing countries such as Indonesia. Palm oil companies themselves have called for this (as we found in our [own research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378017310117)). Government regulation and law enforcement to stop deforestation have shown signs of improving in palm oil-producing countries in recent years, but there is a long way to go.\n\n***On the second point: the “fox guarding the hen house”***\n\nIn summary: the legitimacy of certification schemes which are based on self-regulation by industry is certainly an issue. However, certification schemes remain an important tool in the fight against deforestation. You mentioned FSC but RSPO is the main international multistakeholder certification scheme for palm oil, so we will focus on the RSPO.\n\nFirst, the bad: the RSPO has been criticised for[ domination by commercial interests](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01448.x), [an insufficiently strict standard and slow action on contentious issues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800914002869). For example, most RSPO members are from industry, rather than NGOs, and the RSPO is only this year getting around to adopting a strict ‘no deforestation’ component (up until now, it has protected ‘high conservation value’ areas, although this does include primary forests). The RSPO audit process has also been [criticised](https://eia-international.org/report/who-watches-the-watchmen) in the past for a lack of independent oversight. Greenpeace has always refused to join the RSPO because it says the standard is not stringent enough. Certification in other sectors (including FSC) has also faced similar problems (Greenpeace left the FSC this year).\n\nSo, the RSPO has certainly not been free of the criticisms that you raise and they are legitimate concerns.\n\nNow, the good: there are several reasons why RSPO certification is still a valuable tool for addressing deforestation in the palm oil sector. These take a little unpacking:\n\n* The RSPO is a multistakeholder organisation including NGOs like WWF, WRI and ZSL. Although numerically outnumbered, these NGOs can and do push the environmental agenda within the RSPO.\n* External pressure on the RSPO, including NGO campaigns against RSPO member companies, has driven up the stringency of the standard. The standard is currently under revision and it is set to become a truly ‘no deforestation’ standard for the first time later this year. This improvement is in part due to pressure from external organisations.\n* The RSPO certification audit process is overseen by an independent third party. The conservation parts of the RSPO audit process (High Conservation Value assessments) are also overseen by a different independent third party.\n* Companies cannot ‘veto’ regulations they don’t like - instead, the RSPO standard is developed through a consensus-building consultation process before being put to a vote.\n* By bringing stakeholders of widely different types and objectives together, the RSPO provides a platform for collaboration. This is important for addressing complex problems like deforestation, which no single organisation could ever solve on its own. The downside is this does mean relying on consensus-building, which can be a slow process and may be hampered by conflicting interests (e.g., commercial interests).\n\nThese steps help mitigate the “fox in the henhouse” problem. That being said, certification schemes like the RSPO and FSC cannot solve the deforestation problem on their own. They have their limits, as [recent research](https://news.mongabay.com/2017/12/study-rspo-certification-prunes-deforestation-in-indonesia-but-not-by-much/) has found.\n\n***In summary***\n\nCertification schemes like the RSPO (and, for that matter, FSC) are imperfect - they have their limitations - but they are still really important. The key point is **they are just one of the mechanisms** that can be used to address deforestation. To truly stop deforestation, a combination of mechanisms is needed, including (but not limited to) effective government regulation and law enforcement. What mix of mechanisms is best to tackle deforestation in a given set of circumstances is still unknown - and this is one of the things our research is looking at.\n\nIt’s important to note that certification also remains useful for consumers looking to support conservation by buying sustainable palm oil, and thereby supporting sustainable production.\n\n***On zero-deforestation commitments:***\n\nZero-deforestation commitments by individual companies definitely require auditing by independent third parties to ensure they are being implemented - otherwise it really will be a case of the fox guarding the henhouse! Monitoring implementation is a tough task. Initiatives like the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Supply-Change.org, ZSL’s SPOTT tool and WRI’s Global Forest Watch are all third-party, NGO-led efforts to monitor commitment implementation. Some groups like the Tropical Forest Trust (TFT) also do auditing for companies’ zero-deforestation commitments.",

        "body": "Good question. It's quite hard as a consumer to take action on deforestation - it can seem like a really remote problem, really far away - but there are some useful things you can do.\n\nSomething that’s really important is to buy sustainably-produced palm oil. The reason this is important is that it’s vital that palm oil producers get an incentive to produce palm oil sustainably - and so have a reason to avoid clearing forests. Getting certified for sustainable production is expensive and palm oil profit margins are slim, so it’s important that producers who avoid deforestation have a market for their products. There are huge markets for palm oil in China and India which make no demands for sustainability, and if no-one buys sustainable or deforestation-free oil, producers can always just sell their oil there.\n\nHow can you make sure you're buying sustainable palm oil? You can check which companies (retailers, consumer goods manufacturers) use sustainable palm oil by having a Google search for their name + ‘palm oil’, or check the sustainability sections of their websites.\n\nSecondly, you could look into the websites of some of the retailers and manufacturers of your favourite or most-used goods - chocolate, cakes, biscuits, shampoo, cosmetics - and check what the companies’ sustainability policies are. Do they have a zero-deforestation commitment? Are they members of the RSPO? Do they have a commitment to protecting High Conservation Value (HCV) areas and High Carbon Stock forests (HCS is a standard for ensuring all forests are protected)? If yes - great. If not, you could write to them and put pressure on them to reform their practices. Most companies are really responsive to customer feedback like this. Check out their websites first, as most of the big companies publish lots of sustainability info there.\n\nFinally, lots of the NGOs that work on deforestation and palm oil - like WWF, Greenpeace, Conservation International, to name a few - may be doing work on deforestation that you could get involved with as a volunteer. Check out their websites - this might give you a way of getting involved more actively, beyond just using your purchasing power as a consumer.",

This appears on products like Whole Earth peanut butter, which you’ll see in the supermarket.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this, though - as always with palm oil and deforestation, it’s a complex picture!\n\nThe first problem is that lots of retailers and consumer goods companies don’t like to use the RSPO logo because their products are already covered in lots of different logos, and there is a fear that adding another logo will be confusing or customers won’t pay any attention to it. Lots of the big consumer goods manufacturers and retailers like Tescos, Unilever etc. use RSPO-certified palm oil, but don’t always put the logo on their products.\n\nA second problem is that RSPO isn't (currently) a ‘no deforestation’ standard. 'No deforestation' is quite a challenging concept. How many trees count as a forest? Do weed trees growing on previously cleared land count as a forest? Do badly damaged forests with little remaining biodiversity count? Up until now RSPO certification has protected ‘high conservation value’ areas rather than all forests. This means it hasn’t been a truly ‘no deforestation’ standard and a ‘deforestation free’ logo hasn’t been possible. The standard is being updated this year, though, and the current proposal is that a ‘no deforestation’ criterion will be incorporated. This may help with a ‘no deforestation’ label.\n\nMost public awareness campaigns about palm oil have drawn attention to the problems with it - [Greenpeace’s new ‘Rangtan’ campaign / video (launched yesterday)](https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/rang-tan-video) is a good example. These have been really important for driving change in the industry, but I guess the flipside of this is that ‘good guy’ public awareness campaigns aren’t so attention-grabbing.",

Historically, industrial-scale palm oil production has been responsible for extensive deforestation in the tropics and this is well-documented.\n\nOver the past 10 years, however, some of the big palm oil companies have made good progress in addressing deforestation in their operations and supply chains. The problem is that guaranteeing that palm oil is ‘deforestation free’ is incredibly difficult. Palm oil supply chains are really complex - meaning there are lots of different companies and traders involved in getting palm oil from the trader to the shop floor, and palm oil gets mixed, refined, fractionated, remixed and so on.\n\nThis means it’s hard to be completely certain that a supplier somewhere in the supply chain hasn’t engaged in deforestation. The picture gets even more complex when you consider that about 40% of palm oil production is accounted for by smallholders - of which there are tens of thousands in the supply chain. Add to this the fact that there is confusion over what even counts as ‘forest’ and ‘deforestation’, with conflicting regulations from governments about development and conservation, and the situation becomes a complete mess.\n\nCertification can help with this, as it can be used to track palm oil consignments through the supply chain. The RSPO certification standard is being updated this year and will include - for the first time - a criterion for 'no deforestation'. This should help. Other useful initiatives include a project called Trase, which is using customs data to map global palm oil supply chains. Lots of companies have also put a lot of effort into tracing and disclosing their palm oil suppliers and sources - for example, Unilever published all of their suppliers and supplying mills earlier this year. But there is still a long way to go, and traceability and transparency are not the same thing as sustainability; there's no point simply knowing where your palm oil came from, you need to take active steps to stop deforestation where you find it, too!\n\nSo to sum up, yes, I think it will be possible for palm oil companies to avoid deforestation in their operations and some progress has been made on this. But it’s an incredibly difficult challenge and we aren’t there yet. There is still more some companies with zero-deforestation commitments need to do, and there are still other companies with no commitments that continue to clear forests.\n\nThere will also always be a tension between the need to conserve forests and the perceived need to grow economies in developing countries - which will put pressure on forests for agricultural development, whether for palm oil or other crops.",

Zero-deforestation commitments (policies) are just one type of initiative used - primarily by companies in the private sector - to address deforestation caused by palm oil. A zero-deforestation commitment tends to consist of a policy setting out how a company intends to address deforestation in its operations. This could include avoiding the destruction of ‘high conservation value’ areas and/or ‘high carbon stock’ forests.\n\nOther initiatives used by the private sector include ‘commodity roundtables’, which are groups of different stakeholders that come together to work on addressing deforestation. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which provides certification for sustainably-produced palm oil products, is an example of one of these roundtables. You might have seen an RSPO label on some of the products you buy in the supermarket, like peanut butter.\n\nThere are also public-private partnerships between companies, non-government organisations (NGOs) and governments like the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020. This is a multistakeholder initiative which brings stakeholders from each sector together to address deforestation in a collaborative way. There are also collaborative partnerships between small groups of companies, like the SPOTS initiative by L’Oreal, Clariant, Wilmar and others.\n\nOther sectors (namely, civil society and governments) are also pursuing initiatives to reduce deforestation caused by palm oil production. These include moratoria on issuing new licences for palm oil plantations (e.g., in Indonesia), protected areas, emissions trading schemes (including the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD+ scheme), and a number of other mechanisms. For a long time, NGOs have been waging public-awareness campaigns against companies found to be clearing forests. NGOs also collaborate with companies that show a willingness to reform, to help them improve their practices.\n\nPalm oil production is often just one of a range of pressures on forests in a given landscape - there are also usually pressures from other crops as well as plantation forestry, mining, subsistence agriculture, hunting, etc. The specific context of deforestation is almost always highly complex. This means that to address deforestation successfully, it’s important that combinations of mechanisms are used, rather than just single mechanisms on their own (like zero-deforestation commitments).",

Whilst women may outnumber men in admissions to higher education, they don’t outnumber them in physics or engineering, and they certainly don’t in senior positions. I’d like everyone to feel they had access to college to study whatever they want - tell me what is “grotesque” about that?\n\n**What made you choose to raise the profile of women in science rather than, say, orphans or handicapped or mentally ill or children raised by a single parent or impoverished or struggling people who have NO profile in science?**\n\nI would love to have more time to support orphans, handicapped and the mentally ill. I am not an expert in these fields and wouldn’t want to assume I would know what is best for them, so when I have time off from my research job, I contribute to initiatives I understand a bit better. I also work with teachers and schools to make sure all children, whether they are impoverished or from a  single parent, realise that they can become scientists. We run lots of activities at Imperial for the next generation of scientists ([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/student-recruitment-and-outreach/schools-and-colleges/wohl-reach-out-lab/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/student-recruitment-and-outreach/schools-and-colleges/wohl-reach-out-lab/)) and these are specifically targetted at young people who have ‘no profile in science’ and no ‘science capital’.

We are all making efforts to improve everyone’s access to science, through Imperial’s education program ([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/student-recruitment-and-outreach/schools-and-colleges/wohl-reach-out-lab/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/student-recruitment-and-outreach/schools-and-colleges/wohl-reach-out-lab/)) and the IOP’s Stimulating Physics Network (a national teacher network in the UK). The wikipedia work is totally separate to widening participation in education - we are using the encyclopedia to improve people’s awareness of established scientists and their contributions to their fields. They are both valuable. Again, if you have any other ideas about raising the profile of a “poor child raised by semi-literate parent(s) who overcomes hardship after hardship and becomes a scientist contributing to man's understanding of the world REGARDLESS of their sex”, just let me know. \n\n**Don't you find this emphasis on sex rather than substance to be self-serving in the extreme and ultimately counterproductive?**\n\nWe’ve answered this a tonne of times (see above). Of course we’re focussing on substance. For a long time, substance has only been celebrated for people of a particular sex, and we’re trying to stop that from happening. I want to evaluate scientists on their science, not their gender. \n\n**I wonder how much better off we would be if we tried to encourage bright inquisitive people wherever we find them.

I am sorry that they, and you, have had to experience an “overwhelming bias to girls”.

A good example of this is some of the conversations around language in the ASPIRES and ASPIRES 2 reports (&lt;a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/ASPIRES/ASPIRES-final-report-December-2013.pdf\"&gt;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/ASPIRES/ASPIRES-final-report-December-2013.pdf&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"/r/https\"&gt;r/https&lt;/a&gt;://&lt;a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires/\"&gt;www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires/&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I’m a crystallographer, so I would argue that the seminal work by Dorothy Hodgkin, Rosalind Franklin, Kathleen Lonsdale and Helen Megaw is essential to know about. This is where the variety of science that we are all doing comes into play, as we all have biases as to what the best scientific discoveries are :-D. \n\nI’m going to pick (to no one’s surprise) Dame Prof. Kathleen Lonsdale.

It can also help teachers deal with sexist and sexual comments or inappropriate behaviour.\n\n·    **Use data and evidence**\n\nBy comparing the progression in traditionally gendered subjects to the national average, schools can get an idea how their schools compare to the national average in terms of gender equality in subject choice. This can help identify areas for concern and provide incentives for action.\n\n·    **Rethink science clubs**\n\nScience clubs are often quite boy-heavy, which can put interested girls off.

At the moment, supplying electricity on a large scale from renewable power that had been stored in a pump storage facility would, I believe, be significantly more expensive than nuclear power or fossil energy with carbon storage, at least in the UK.  We have relatively little hydropower and only one major pump storage facility.\n\nFor countries with a lot of hydropower, such as Norway or Brazil, there is an excellent synergy between renewables and hydro, and adding a pump facility to an existing hydro plant may be economically attractive.
