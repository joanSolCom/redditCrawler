He was with the FBI and did an interview right after with a key Yemeni detainee (who I later tracked down in Sanaa, after he was released from prison, to interview as well). Soufan, who speaks Arabic and knew so much about Al Qaeda was able to get key intelligence from this detainee, who went by the name of Abu Jandal. You  know what really helped? Soufan noticed he was diabetic and not touching the cookies he would bring. So found sugar-free cookies. He actually testified about this later in arguing against torture.

        "body": "Lisa here. Thanks for all your questions!  I think the most surprising thing for me was to find that the wounds are still so raw for so many people. In the Martensville case, lots of people have been left feeling unsure about what really happened, even though it’s clear that of the 180 charges against 9 people, 178 of them were false allegations that were spurred on by a panic. The wrongfully accused in the case still deal with a perception from some that they were guilty. And I also found that there were even more people whose lives were altered by this than we knew. (More people accused, dozens and dozens, in this small town of under 4000 people at the time.) I was really shocked by how unresolved this whole thing is, not just in Martensville but in most of these cases where people were just left to pick up the pieces without any kind of large-scale reckoning with the reality of the hysteria and its effects.   \n\nLisa again: I think there were a whole bunch of factors that created an environment in which it was possible not only to have these anxieties flourish, but to have them validated and believed by institutions (like the media &amp; the courts) that should be based on critical thinking, hard fact and sober reasoning. Some of those factors are things like a general fear of cults and satanism, and fear around a growing understanding of childhood sexual abuse. BUT, within that, Michelle Remembers seems to have given a compelling narrative, validated by a respected psychiatrist, and that book/memoir definitely became the template for the allegations. \n\nDan Zakreski here. Martensville unfolded in lockstep with another case involving the Klassen family. Similarly outrageous allegations, only this time directed at a local foster family. Google “Saskatchewan” and “Scandal of the Century.”",

As we said in the podcast, whenever a parent worries about pedophiles, it’s usually about someone that wants to hurt your child. You very rarely worry about your child being a pedophile themselves.\n\nI think the journalism or storytelling actually helped me deal with the difficult material psychologically. Seeing it as an important story to be told well helped to not get too emotionally involved. That said, it’s hard not to be affected. I started sending information about child abuse prevention to every mother and father of young children that I know. Once you start seeing how prevalent this stuff is, it’s hard not to suspect it everywhere.\n\nDAEMON - It was definitely hard. But I was really motivated to tell the story. When we started talking to Jen, Ben’s relative, it really became clear that elucidating what Ben had done--and how it affected her--was really important in terms of allowing her to take control of the narrative. Until she had told her story, she had just been a ‘victim’. She told us that telling her story was empowering. So that helped mitigate a lot of the psychological toll. That said, I definitely had some moments where I was overwhelmed by the heaviness of what we were covering. That said, I think almost all good stories have an emotional pull--what’s tugging at the journalist emotionally to do the story. Personally I don’t believe in separating how I feel from my journalism. I work really hard to be aware of my feelings so that it doesn’t unduly influence my reporting. Part of the reason I like the podcast format is that it allows journalists to articulate their emotions, which I actually think helps the reporting. It’s a form of transparency, in a way. When I tell listeners how I’m feeling, I think it allows them to better interpret the factual content. \n\nHAKON - To be frank, being a journalist and working on this subject professionally helps me keep a distance. As a nerd, it is fascinating to learn more about how twisted the human psyche can get. At the same time it is really, really important to preserve the dignity of all the people involved in the story - also the abusers and perpetrators. We need to keep in mind that also they are humans, and that what they have done is not inhuman or monstrous - just (sadly enough) human.",

He was with the FBI and did an interview right after with a key Yemeni detainee (who I later tracked down in Sanaa, after he was released from prison, to interview as well). Soufan, who speaks Arabic and knew so much about Al Qaeda was able to get key intelligence from this detainee, who went by the name of Abu Jandal. You  know what really helped? Soufan noticed he was diabetic and not touching the cookies he would bring. So found sugar-free cookies. He actually testified about this later in arguing against torture.

        "body": "Lisa here. Thanks for all your questions!  I think the most surprising thing for me was to find that the wounds are still so raw for so many people. In the Martensville case, lots of people have been left feeling unsure about what really happened, even though it’s clear that of the 180 charges against 9 people, 178 of them were false allegations that were spurred on by a panic. The wrongfully accused in the case still deal with a perception from some that they were guilty. And I also found that there were even more people whose lives were altered by this than we knew. (More people accused, dozens and dozens, in this small town of under 4000 people at the time.) I was really shocked by how unresolved this whole thing is, not just in Martensville but in most of these cases where people were just left to pick up the pieces without any kind of large-scale reckoning with the reality of the hysteria and its effects.   \n\nLisa again: I think there were a whole bunch of factors that created an environment in which it was possible not only to have these anxieties flourish, but to have them validated and believed by institutions (like the media &amp; the courts) that should be based on critical thinking, hard fact and sober reasoning. Some of those factors are things like a general fear of cults and satanism, and fear around a growing understanding of childhood sexual abuse. BUT, within that, Michelle Remembers seems to have given a compelling narrative, validated by a respected psychiatrist, and that book/memoir definitely became the template for the allegations. \n\nDan Zakreski here. Martensville unfolded in lockstep with another case involving the Klassen family. Similarly outrageous allegations, only this time directed at a local foster family. Google “Saskatchewan” and “Scandal of the Century.”",

He told me that his colleague with the Texas Troopers is suggesting the podcast as a means of continuing education to help inform their police officers about on-line abuse and pedophilia. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HAKON - I’ve been in close touch with the psych. experts here in Norway throughout the investigation, and so far, the feedback I have received is very positive to the way we have presented&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

As we said in the podcast, whenever a parent worries about pedophiles, it’s usually about someone that wants to hurt your child. You very rarely worry about your child being a pedophile themselves.\n\nI think the journalism or storytelling actually helped me deal with the difficult material psychologically. Seeing it as an important story to be told well helped to not get too emotionally involved. That said, it’s hard not to be affected. I started sending information about child abuse prevention to every mother and father of young children that I know. Once you start seeing how prevalent this stuff is, it’s hard not to suspect it everywhere.\n\nDAEMON - It was definitely hard. But I was really motivated to tell the story. When we started talking to Jen, Ben’s relative, it really became clear that elucidating what Ben had done--and how it affected her--was really important in terms of allowing her to take control of the narrative. Until she had told her story, she had just been a ‘victim’. She told us that telling her story was empowering. So that helped mitigate a lot of the psychological toll. That said, I definitely had some moments where I was overwhelmed by the heaviness of what we were covering. That said, I think almost all good stories have an emotional pull--what’s tugging at the journalist emotionally to do the story. Personally I don’t believe in separating how I feel from my journalism. I work really hard to be aware of my feelings so that it doesn’t unduly influence my reporting. Part of the reason I like the podcast format is that it allows journalists to articulate their emotions, which I actually think helps the reporting. It’s a form of transparency, in a way. When I tell listeners how I’m feeling, I think it allows them to better interpret the factual content. \n\nHAKON - To be frank, being a journalist and working on this subject professionally helps me keep a distance. As a nerd, it is fascinating to learn more about how twisted the human psyche can get. At the same time it is really, really important to preserve the dignity of all the people involved in the story - also the abusers and perpetrators. We need to keep in mind that also they are humans, and that what they have done is not inhuman or monstrous - just (sadly enough) human.",

But I can tell you what I've observed from my time at Queen's Park under both Lib &amp; PC govts: savvy premiers listen to their backbenchers, who are their ears to the ground, especially those in swing ridings.

I've actually interviewed a lot of people in jails .. criminals, terrorists .. just some difficult interviews, in difficult places. But I think we felt so much was riding on these interviews. We'd asked Sharmini's friends, family, anyone who knew her, to revisit a dark time.. so it felt like we should get something substantial from the interviews. We really prepped. There were times when we'd closely watch his body language, or try different ways of asking questions, because we had read the psychiatrist assessments of him that said he was a chronic liar. It was tough. \n\nWe did highlight inconsistencies. I had the interview from 20 years ago to compare his answers to this time. Some pretty fundamental facts (like did he used to drive Sharmini and other kids in his building to swimming lessons -- something he said in 1999 that he did). He had different answers this time. I'm not sure if that's important from a police / prosecutor perspective. I hope we can follow up.",

I&amp;#39;ve actually interviewed a lot of people in jails .. criminals, terrorists .. just some difficult interviews, in difficult places. But I think we felt so much was riding on these interviews. We&amp;#39;d asked Sharmini&amp;#39;s friends, family, anyone who knew her, to revisit a dark time.. so it felt like we should get something substantial from the interviews. We really prepped. There were times when we&amp;#39;d closely watch his body language, or try different ways of asking questions, because we had read the psychiatrist assessments of him that said he was a chronic liar. It was tough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did highlight inconsistencies. I had the interview from 20 years ago to compare his answers to this time. Some pretty fundamental facts (like did he used to drive Sharmini and other kids in his building to swimming lessons -- something he said in 1999 that he did). He had different answers this time. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s important from a police / prosecutor perspective. I hope we can follow up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Both are great places to work. I would also add that I have a lot of freedom here, nobody tells me what angle to take or what questions to ask and that's huge for me. Not to say there isn't a lot of discussion and debate - and of course I have to be open to different perspectives, there's just a lot of freedom. I'm not good at forecasting the future, unfortunately, and I know there are issues with resources all over right now but I also know a lot of people who take their jobs really seriously.",

And his cop sources were great. So in 1981 he interviewed homicide about their continued efforts to solve these murders (at this point, the oldest one was some 6 years old, so the fact that they were still working these cases says a lot.) These homicide cops were snidely chiding their coworkers on morality by saying \"Hey, listen, we don't care about the bathhouses, we want to solve murders.\" I thought that was so interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other was Julian Fantino. He was a homicide cop on the beat in the late 1970s. He worked several of these killings. He would go on to be Chief of Police in York, Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, and ultimately Chief in Toronto. Then he retired, and was elected to Parliament, where he would go on to serve in cabinet. Long career. He also became notorious in the LGBTQ community for a variety of reasons (If you Google it, there's been lots written.) I worked for months to get an interview with him, and we finally got on the phone. Unfortunately, he remembers very little about the cases. But, of everyone I spoke to, he was actually the most philosophical about everything. He chided other cops for focusing too much on sex work and drugs — suggesting that preconceived notions might have hindered some of those investigations. It was interesting — but, unfortunately, too general for us to use.",
