Fingers crossed that we'll do it another time. \n\nEvery time we run a workshop, the students are asked to produce a story. And they have to interview someone for the story. And, while the stations we sometimes collaborate with consider the workshop-produced stories for broadcast, there's no guarantee it will air. And, despite that, the interviewees ALWAYS say yes. \n\nWhen the students reach out to potential interviewees they identify themselves as a student. I don't, maybe the interviewees take pity on them because they're students. :) But, you could do the same thing. Just say you're a student. I've done that doing street photography (which I suck at). I will say to someone \"I'm a student in a photo workshop and I'd like to take a photo of...\" It's a bit of a lie, I suppose. But not really because I'm always looking to improve my photography. So, maybe you could try that with a radio story. \n\nYour second question is harder to answer. I'm not sure I have a succinct answer for you. Sorry. But, two thoughts. \n\n1. Sometimes the best stories are the ones where the producer is driven by a gut feeling that there's something there. So, I say follow your gut. \n2. On a more practical level, try this: sum up your story idea in a single sentence.

Fingers crossed that we&amp;#39;ll do it another time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time we run a workshop, the students are asked to produce a story. And they have to interview someone for the story. And, while the stations we sometimes collaborate with consider the workshop-produced stories for broadcast, there&amp;#39;s no guarantee it will air. And, despite that, the interviewees ALWAYS say yes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the students reach out to potential interviewees they identify themselves as a student. I don&amp;#39;t, maybe the interviewees take pity on them because they&amp;#39;re students. :) But, you could do the same thing. Just say you&amp;#39;re a student.

        "body": "Goodness. We could write a dissertation on this! On one hand, audio storytelling and reporting was at one point a lonely business. There weren't many of us. And, it was hard to break in. Then, podcasting happen. That leveled the playing field -- a good thing. And, there are all manner of podcasts for all manner of listeners rather than a lot of one-size-fits all programming. \n\nThat said, for me personally, I worry about the chase after money. While money isn't a bad thing for audio storytelling -- people should be paid and expenses need to be covered. It shouldn't be a pledge of poverty. \n\nHowever, one money is the driving force rather than public good.... I'm a firm believer in the mission of public media as written by Bill Siemering 50 years ago. Despite the mission's age, it's commitment to diversity and plurality and creativity is incredibly valuable today. Bill talks about here: [https://transom.org/2020/what-do-you-stand-for/](https://transom.org/2020/what-do-you-stand-for/)\n\nSo, I think what people need to do -- whether they're working for public media or for a commercial podcast company -- is ask yourself \"What do you stand for?\" Then ask if you're personal mission meets the mission of the organization your working for.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodness. We could write a dissertation on this! On one hand, audio storytelling and reporting was at one point a lonely business. There weren&amp;#39;t many of us. And, it was hard to break in. Then, podcasting happen. That leveled the playing field -- a good thing. And, there are all manner of podcasts for all manner of listeners rather than a lot of one-size-fits all programming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, for me personally, I worry about the chase after money. While money isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing for audio storytelling -- people should be paid and expenses need to be covered. It shouldn&amp;#39;t be a pledge of poverty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, one money is the driving force rather than public good.... I&amp;#39;m a firm believer in the mission of public media as written by Bill Siemering 50 years ago.

However, they're wicked hard to pull off. \n\nThe key is the interview. You have to ask questions that lead tape that will stand on its on. Not as easy as it sounds since not everyone expresses themselves with complete thoughts and ideas. \n\nHere are a couple of tricks.... 1. Typically, the rule in interviewing is that you ask one question at a time. However, I've noticed, that, in some instances, when you ask several questions at a time the interviewee is more likely to answer completely. The quetions, however, have to closely related. Like to a dairy farmer: \"Tell me about the cows here. How many? What kind? How much milk? Ya know, give me an over view of the cows.\" They'll answer with a paragraph of info rathern than fragments. \n\n2. Listen as they talk. Edit them in your head. (OMG this is hard!) As they're talking ask yourself \"Will that stand alone?\" If not, you need to ask them the question again in a slightly different way. Later, you may have to meld the two responses. \n\n2a. Often, if you flip the first and second sentences of someone's response when you edit, that will help. That's because sometimes the first sentence in a response is often half a thought. The second sentence is fuller. And, so if you flip them, it will make more sense. \n\n3. Since there's no narrator, you need to know what a narrator does in a story -- helps move from one place to another, describes things, etc. You need to ask questions that will prompt the interviewee to do the work of a narrator. So, if you're in the cow barn with a dairy farmer, ask them something like \"Okay, for people who are listening and can't see what we're looking it, describe the cow barn for me. What do you see?\" \n\nHope that helps!",

If he's reporting on a neighborhood and he wants to ask residents some questions, he'll go to their doors, knock, then go to the bottom of the stairs and wait for them to open the door so that he's at a distance. He'll then tell them what he's doing. They can either come out and meet him on the sidewalk. Or, he's had people record an answer to a question on their phone then email him. As for the sidewalk convos, he's used a boom pole and wears a mask. Is that what you mean?",
