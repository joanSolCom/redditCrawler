        "body": "It's interesting that you bring up private prisons, because we actually devote an entire episode to looking at their role in the justice system. In Episode 4, Jess and Henry went to Evanston, Wyoming to look at what was set to be the site of a new privately run immigration detention center (check it out if you're interested!) But the main misperception we explore is that private prisons actually make up a pretty small chunk of the pie when you look at mass incarceration. That's not to say they're not a problem, but more that they're simply responding to needs of the much larger publicly owned system, which profits enormously from mass incarceration ($182 billion go into incarceration every year, 2% of which goes to private facilities). So closing down private prison companies won't do a ton to end mass incarceration. BUT – what they teach us about the system as a whole (like what's contributing to recidivism rates and the \"revolving door\" you mention) can be really telling in terms of what *would* make a difference and push us in the right direction.\n\nThe other issue, like lack of funding towards mental health services, is also really important to think about. When you look at the role of prisons in our modern day (American) society, they often become a catchall for many of our country's problems (like mental illness, substance use disorders, poverty, unemployment, etc). Rather than dealing with these issues, we lock people up. So what would it look like if we didn't rely on prisons to \"solve\" these issues, and rather funded alternatives that address the root causes of crime? It forces us to think about both prevention (addressing these issues before someone commits a crime) and treatment (which provides services to people so they don't reoffend), which makes a huge difference. We talk about those things in our final episode, which we'll publish on September 14th here: [https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up) \\- Sam",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting that you bring up private prisons, because we actually devote an entire episode to looking at their role in the justice system. In Episode 4, Jess and Henry went to Evanston, Wyoming to look at what was set to be the site of a new privately run immigration detention center (check it out if you&amp;#39;re interested!) But the main misperception we explore is that private prisons actually make up a pretty small chunk of the pie when you look at mass incarceration. That&amp;#39;s not to say they&amp;#39;re not a problem, but more that they&amp;#39;re simply responding to needs of the much larger publicly owned system, which profits enormously from mass incarceration ($182 billion go into incarceration every year, 2% of which goes to private facilities). So closing down private prison companies won&amp;#39;t do a ton to end mass incarceration. BUT – what they teach us about the system as a whole (like what&amp;#39;s contributing to recidivism rates and the &amp;quot;revolving door&amp;quot; you mention) can be really telling in terms of what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; make a difference and push us in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other issue, like lack of funding towards mental health services, is also really important to think about. When you look at the role of prisons in our modern day (American) society, they often become a catchall for many of our country&amp;#39;s problems (like mental illness, substance use disorders, poverty, unemployment, etc). Rather than dealing with these issues, we lock people up. So what would it look like if we didn&amp;#39;t rely on prisons to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; these issues, and rather funded alternatives that address the root causes of crime? It forces us to think about both prevention (addressing these issues before someone commits a crime) and treatment (which provides services to people so they don&amp;#39;t reoffend), which makes a huge difference. We talk about those things in our final episode, which we&amp;#39;ll publish on September 14th here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up\"&gt;https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up&lt;/a&gt; - Sam&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Those cases concerned:\n\n\\- two Indiana laws, one requiring an ultrasound and an 18-hour waiting period before an abortion, and one requiring minors to obtain parental consent before getting an abortion\n\n\\- a case from Pennsylvania and a case from Illinois over whether govts can shield areas in front of abortion clinics from protesters\n\nThere are also cases percolating in lower courts on \"heartbeat bills\" (banning abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy) and an Alabama law that would ban all abortions except to save the life of the mother. \n\nIn short, there are two types of cases coming through the courts right now: 1) Cases that would further regulate abortion access (e.g. waiting period and parental consent laws); and 2) Cases that would challenge the constitutionality of abortion itself (e.g. the Alabama law). With the volume of conservative judges Trump has been putting on the courts, those second types of cases will continue to come through. Whether they'd be successful at SCOTUS is another question though.\n\n\\-Henry",

Those cases concerned:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- two Indiana laws, one requiring an ultrasound and an 18-hour waiting period before an abortion, and one requiring minors to obtain parental consent before getting an abortion&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- a case from Pennsylvania and a case from Illinois over whether govts can shield areas in front of abortion clinics from protesters&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also cases percolating in lower courts on &amp;quot;heartbeat bills&amp;quot; (banning abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy) and an Alabama law that would ban all abortions except to save the life of the mother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, there are two types of cases coming through the courts right now: 1) Cases that would further regulate abortion access (e.g. waiting period and parental consent laws); and 2) Cases that would challenge the constitutionality of abortion itself (e.g. the Alabama law). With the volume of conservative judges Trump has been putting on the courts, those second types of cases will continue to come through. Whether they&amp;#39;d be successful at SCOTUS is another question though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Henry&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If they get their restrictions affirmed by SCOTUS, great, but if not – as in this most recent case – it's not an insurmountable setback. There’s also the (admittedly small) risk that a weak case that makes it up to SCOTUS only forces the justices to affirm Roe.\n\nBut if a powerful case emerges that seems to the anti-abortion movement like it could overturn Roe totally, I can also imagine them taking the chance. -Jess",

A ruling like Bostock helps in that regard, but we're seeing conservatives pushing for more \"reliably conservative\" (aka \"no more Souters\") justices, Trump saying he'll only nominate judges who'll strike down Roe v. Wade etc. It puts the court -- and Chief Justice Roberts in particular -- in a tough spot.

I'd say they're already quite a way down that road though, but unpredictability is I think one answer.\n\nAnother answer could also be what we saw last month: livestreamed oral arguments. At the moment most people only hear/read about the court after a big ruling that's often 5-4 along partisan lines. As people who may have listened to the livestreams last month will now know, lots of the court's cases are actually pretty boring, and the justices themselves actually work very cordially with each other. Letting the public see more of those aspects of the court would help.\n\nFinally, the Louisiana abortion case they're deciding now is big for this. The Louisiana law is basically identical to a Texas law the court struck down in 2016. The 5th Circuit upheld it anyway, and if the court allows that to stand it would be a massive blow against institutional integrity, I'd say.
