Four-year campuses are typically integrated communities with substantial human and organizational resources that can be leveraged to enact change for entire student populations. Furthermore, mental health is a  strong predictor of academic performance and college persistence, so there's an economic case for campuses to invest in mental health prevention and treatment to retain students and avoid lost tuition.

I feel really lucky to have like-minded colleagues who care about our amazing students!\n\nAs I mentioned when I guest lectured last semester, I co-lead a national mental health survey called the Healthy Minds Study, which is conducted every semester at college and university campuses across the country. Last month, we revised Healthy Minds to include new questions designed to understand students’ personal experiences, behaviors, and beliefs during the pandemic. We will have data from those new items in the coming weeks, which we will disseminate publicly. So that's one key way that my research has shifted to focus on the impact of COVID-19. Another way is collaborating with colleagues tracking state policies and building a detailed database that can be used by researchers to answer a variety of key public health questions. The COVID-19 US state policy database is led by my colleague Julia Raifman at BUSPH, and more info is here: https://www.bu.edu/sph/2020/04/01/tracking-covid-19-policies/. There are many other really exciting and important research projects going on at BUSPH related to the pandemic, highlighted on our school website, as you've likely seen!\n\nThanks for being part of our community, and good luck with finals!",

Just reading your comment shows that you are in touch with yourself, which is a huge first step.

In terms of what you can do to overcome this, I can't provide clinical guidance because I am not a mental health professional. Right now, more so than ever, people are relying on mobile mental health resources. You question reminded me of an app I heard about a while back called Youper. I don't know much about it, but the website has a video called \"Overcome Social Anxiety\": https://youtu.be/4cCezXy64OM. Here's a link to their website (and I'm sure there are other great resources for social anxiety as well!): https://www.youper.ai/app-for-social-anxiety.

Overall, mental health conditions are the largest burden of disease among adolescents and young adults. The former director of the National Institute of Mental Health referred to mental illnesses as \"the chronic diseases of the young.\" So it's important to compare college student populations to their same-aged peers, namely adolescents and young adults who are not in college. When comparing college students to their peers who are not in college, the prevalence is very similar. In other words, college students aren't doing significantly better or worse than non-college-students. There has been limited research on this, but one of the largest comparative studies on mental and behavioral health found similar rates in the two groups with the exception of binge drinking being higher in college students and rates of schizophrenia being higher in non-college-attending adolescents and young adults.\n\nAs for what contributes to the generally high rates in adolescents and young adults, there are many factors, as you might imagine. The main explanations are likely factors that are common to young people throughout the U.S. and probably many other countries. Social media use has been one factor that has been talked about a lot as a potentially important contributor to rising rates, as have sociopolitical factors that contribute to concerns such as ecoanxiety (fear about environmental damage and climate change). Sociologists have also talked about intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, societally.\n\nFor more information, check out this article by my colleague Daniel Eisenberg in the Journal of Adolescent Health called \"Countering the Troubling Increase in Mental Health Symptoms Among U.S. College Students.\"",
