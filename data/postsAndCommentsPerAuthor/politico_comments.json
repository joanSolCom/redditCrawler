Most of those are in Maricopa County, which is the swing county in the state. Biden has led there -- but I&amp;#39;d image that the Trump campaign&amp;#39;s hope is that they perform better in Maricopa with those late ballots, and run up the score in the rural areas.

But we do know generally that the levels for Biden were just off in a lot of states.\n\nA few small things: I think it's incumbent on the media to do a better job explaining that there are other sources of error in polls besides what goes into that little \"margin of error\" number -- and we should internalize that and not become prisoners in our reporting to whatever the polling averages say. It goes against many of our instincts, but we have to spend more time thinking and even writing about how polls could be wrong.\n\nWe ought to report more on the polling industry and how it's adapting (or not) to measuring today's public opinion. And hopefully, pollsters can rebuild trust with news consumers over time. It's not a perfect tool by any means, but it's the best thing we've got for measuring public sentiment. -- Scott",

But we do know generally that the levels for Biden were just off in a lot of states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few small things: I think it&amp;#39;s incumbent on the media to do a better job explaining that there are other sources of error in polls besides what goes into that little &amp;quot;margin of error&amp;quot; number -- and we should internalize that and not become prisoners in our reporting to whatever the polling averages say. It goes against many of our instincts, but we have to spend more time thinking and even writing about how polls could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ought to report more on the polling industry and how it&amp;#39;s adapting (or not) to measuring today&amp;#39;s public opinion. And hopefully, pollsters can rebuild trust with news consumers over time. It&amp;#39;s not a perfect tool by any means, but it&amp;#39;s the best thing we&amp;#39;ve got for measuring public sentiment. -- Scott&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That headline on that one poll was probably not the best! But we try our best to provide fair coverage, and learn from when we make mistakes.\n\nAnd re debate time: My colleagues answered some other questions about that, but Sen.

Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/democratic-candidates-policy-positions\"&gt;whole bunch of cheat sheets&lt;/a&gt; from our reporters on candidates&amp;#39; policy proposals, if you&amp;#39;re curious. We also have some really talented reporters covering Sanders and the left. I&amp;#39;d recommend my colleague Holly Otterbein&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/12/08/trump-changed-everything-big-cities-break-hard-left-in-democratic-primary-1231142\"&gt;recent reporting&lt;/a&gt; on how big cities are moving left in the era of Trump, and our team&amp;#39;s work on how &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/05/medicare-for-all-2020-democratic-primary-075034\"&gt;senators&amp;#39; embrace of Sanders&amp;#39; Medicare for All proposal&lt;/a&gt; was the defining moment of the primary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we make mistakes too. That headline on that one poll was probably not the best! But we try our best to provide fair coverage, and learn from when we make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And re debate time: My colleagues answered some other questions about that, but Sen. Sanders has gotten a good amount of time, and candidates&amp;#39; will get more than ever with the smallest stage. -- Zach&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So the DNC was certainly put in a tough situation at the start of the primary -- there was well over 20 candidates in the race at the start, and that's obviously way too many candidates to be on stage at one point. The DNC also wanted to avoid what Republicans did in 2016: have a \"kiddie table\" debate.\n\nCandidates have, at just about every step of the way, been upset with the rules after the first round. The threshold I've seen that's gotten the most heartburn is the donor one. Campaigns have repeatedly argued that the donor threshold forces them to divert resources into digital ads (which is a good way to get donor more donors) instead of on the ground resources.\n\nInterestingly, that's not what's keeping anybody off the stage for the December debate! No candidate who has hit the polling threshold has not hit the donor threshold. I'm interested to see if (or how) the rules change for the debates in 2020.

Certainly, Trump wishes Republicans would fall in line behind his every decision. But the truth is, Trump cares about his image far more than he cares about American foreign policy, or about trade wars, or about the finer points of tax reform. Those disagreements on substance don't register with the president; or, even if sometimes they do, it's not with the visceral nature of critiques of his personal style. Republicans know this. That's why they are comfortable denouncing his decision-making on Syria, or trashing his trade policies, or arguing with him over gun control.

But the truth is, Trump cares about his image far more than he cares about American foreign policy, or about trade wars, or about the finer points of tax reform. Those disagreements on substance don&amp;#39;t register with the president; or, even if sometimes they do, it&amp;#39;s not with the visceral nature of critiques of his personal style. Republicans know this. That&amp;#39;s why they are comfortable denouncing his decision-making on Syria, or trashing his trade policies, or arguing with him over gun control. They realize he&amp;#39;s not emotionally invested in those disputes; they know a disagreement with Trump will not endanger their careers in the way a personal tit-for-tat would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-TA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But they think it&amp;#39;s all a distraction; they are far more interested in what the president is delivering on a policy basis: conservative judges, tax cuts, deregulatory policies, criminal justice reform, anti-abortion funding, etc. As long as Trump continues to fight for their agenda -- and, perhaps more important, as long as he continues to fight the American left on matters of politics and culture -- they will remain steadfast in supporting him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-TA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

An RLA adapts the sample size to ensure that you already get to a high level of confidence, regardless of how close the outcome was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other states have recently passed RLA legislation, including Rhode Island and Virginia, and many counties across the country are piloting RLAs, but it&amp;#39;s going to take a lot of work to get every state to run them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;—Alex&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

ES&amp;S is a good illustration of the risk: they create the ballot programming for 2000 jurisdictions across 34 states from their corporate headquarters, which is a much more centralized point of attack that most people are aware exists.\n\nOne important defense is to make sure you have the latest firmware.  But voting machine firmware tends to be years out of date, because there's a lengthy certification process.  For instance, the latest certified ES&amp;S software still relies on Windows 7, which will soon be unsupported by Microsoft.\n\nIncredibly, most states do not even require that jurisdictions use the newest available firmware.  For example, Georgia currently uses paperless DREs across the state with firmware that hasn't been updated since 2005.\n\nThe strongest and most important defense is to rigorously audit the paper trail, through manual risk-limiting audits.  Even if the machines are somehow hacked, such audits ensure that there's only a small statistical chance that any outcome-altering fraud will go undetected.  That creates a powerful deterrent, and if an attack happens anyway, you can correct it by recounting the paper.\n\n —Alex",

For instance, the latest certified ES&amp;amp;S software still relies on Windows 7, which will soon be unsupported by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, most states do not even require that jurisdictions use the newest available firmware.  For example, Georgia currently uses paperless DREs across the state with firmware that hasn&amp;#39;t been updated since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strongest and most important defense is to rigorously audit the paper trail, through manual risk-limiting audits.  Even if the machines are somehow hacked, such audits ensure that there&amp;#39;s only a small statistical chance that any outcome-altering fraud will go undetected.  That creates a powerful deterrent, and if an attack happens anyway, you can correct it by recounting the paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;—Alex&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You can use your hands as that \"machine\" and mark a paper ballot by hand, or you can have an electronic device where you make your choices and it spits out a paper record (or only records your vote digitally, which is the big problem in many counties right now).\n\nThe second is the tabulation machine. You can have poll workers manually counting votes based on the paper ballots, or you can have an optical scanner that digitally tallies votes based on those same ballots.\n\nTallying votes isn't as much of an issue — because optical scanners are pretty fast — as managing the devices that are used to actually *record* the votes.

You can use your hands as that &amp;quot;machine&amp;quot; and mark a paper ballot by hand, or you can have an electronic device where you make your choices and it spits out a paper record (or only records your vote digitally, which is the big problem in many counties right now).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second is the tabulation machine. You can have poll workers manually counting votes based on the paper ballots, or you can have an optical scanner that digitally tallies votes based on those same ballots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tallying votes isn&amp;#39;t as much of an issue — because optical scanners are pretty fast — as managing the devices that are used to actually &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; the votes.

I have tons of students who intern at SpaceX, Virgin, JPL, Relativity Space and I know they will go on to do great things.

I have tons of students who intern at SpaceX, Virgin, JPL, Relativity Space and I know they will go on to do great things. When they and other workers get paid they put the money back into the economy. It&amp;#39;s certainly as valuable as building military assets that we hope we will never use.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Gateway idea is a way to engage international partners in Europe and elsewhere in NASA&amp;#39;s mission and the Moon Village Association , led by Giuseppe Reibaldi (formerly of ESA) is a great European effort focused on the moon.  &lt;a href=\"https://moonvillageassociation.org/\"&gt;https://moonvillageassociation.org/&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Greg&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In the Trump Administration, the Vice President’s leadership on the National Space Council (and the re-invigoration of the National Space Council in the first place) made a huge difference in the energy, from all levels of government, being injected into the policy making process. I don’t think you have to look very far to see that President Trump and Vice President Pence have a strong interest in civil, commercial, and national security space policy. Whether or not you agree with them is a different question, but the ability of the government to mobilize for any large-scale effort like going to the Moon is absolutely proportional to the amount of leadership at the top. Imagine, for example, if JFK had never made his Moonshot speech or called on Congress to fund it?\n\nAs far as the party line part of this question, it was my experience as a Congressional staffer and while at the National Space Council that space policy wasn’t partisan, it was sometimes parochial, but almost never partisan. I think there is an argument to be made that the fact that President Trump made the Space Force and Moon 2024 signature space policy items for his Administration means that it automatically had detractors, but even there, it is really more of a debate of “how” rather than “if.” It is also worth pointing out that, at least as far back as I can remember, almost every single space policy related legislation has either received unanimous consent (everyone agrees) or garnered huge bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate.\n\n\\-Jared",

I think there is an argument to be made that the fact that President Trump made the Space Force and Moon 2024 signature space policy items for his Administration means that it automatically had detractors, but even there, it is really more of a debate of “how” rather than “if.” It is also worth pointing out that, at least as far back as I can remember, almost every single space policy related legislation has either received unanimous consent (everyone agrees) or garnered huge bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Jared&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Regarding party line issues, historically NASA and human space exploration has been a bipartisan issue.  This is best seen in Congress where policy has been established through a series of recent NASA Authorization Acts beginning in 2005 that have had strong bipartisan support and have largely built one upon the other.

Jim also noted that the mandate isn't just to go back to the moon but to go back to the moon to stay (the theme of this year's ISDC). Doing this sustainably is more expensive than doing another \"moon stunt.\" Building a Gateway and ground infrastructure and NASA Ames Lunar (LCOTS) are important ways of making that sustainable and putting \"stakes in the ground\" to protect the mission from domestic political risk (being canceled in future) ensure international partners are on our \"team\" and define some operational area on the ground in strategic locations (LCOTS).  \n\n\nBridenstine has noted that this approach with Gateway needs $20B - $30B overall. As Jared comments, that needs Congressional support which was clearly in place before the last election and which still seems promising but not entirely certain. I fully support that effort. We can afford to do this and now is when it must be done.\n\nSee Bridenstine's talk at: [https://www.facebook.com/AdminJimBridenstine/videos/live-speaking-at-isdc-2019-about-nasas-artemis-program/374479926517324/](https://www.facebook.com/AdminJimBridenstine/videos/live-speaking-at-isdc-2019-about-nasas-artemis-program/374479926517324/)  \n\n\nSome commercial folks would insist that NASA has sufficient funding to go back to the moon now using direct means and that NASA's priorities are micromanaged by parochial (regional) Congressional interests that do not always align with our national economic interests. Robert Zubrin's book The Case for Space and his Moon Direct paper are clear on this position.   \n\n\nPersonally, I think both approaches are the right answer. NASA needs to move forward with Artemis but should also allocated a $2B - $5B for \"plan B\" commercial missions to the moon using the milestone driven model that worked so well with COTS (which developed the SpaceX Falcon 9 + Dragon and Orbital Antares + Cygnus) for less than $1B. Putting all our eggs in one basket with a single linear program that has several single points of failure is risky. We were lucky the first time and fun for the nationalists who look at space like a soccer match, but that's no way to manage a program that is supposed to significantly improve our economic future. I'm also a fan of the LCOTS and Gateway as commercial opportunities - as long as nothing NASA does precludes also fully embracing commercial alternatives for transport both to Gateway and direct.   \n\n\nTo put it in perspective the COST OVERUN ON F-35 (not the planes, just the budget overrun) is $160B or 8 times more Bridenstine's request. We can afford Artemis!  \n\n\n\\-Greg",

It is difficult for businesses, no matter what type of business they are, to plan for the future investments and future activities if they don’t actually know what they government is going to need for the program. On the industry side, I really believe companies should go through a rigorous process internally to determine what they do and don’t want to participate in when government does a call for proposals or opens contracts. In my opinion, one of the most damaging things that industry can do for a program like this is overpromise and underdeliver. I don’t think that companies do this intentionally, but if you don’t have a strong grasp on your business case and your technological capability, it is easy to get excited about an effort and overpromise. When contractors (or government for that matter) can’t deliver on their promises, it hurts the overall effort for developing policy to endorse and promote those programs. Finally, from the academic community, we need to find ways to better talk about those inquiries that have been yielding outcomes that help us understand better what happens to us (humans) in space and how we can utilize that information to push the ball forward on long-duration human spaceflight.

His reply is great: \"No, God forbid, no. No. No... If we haven’t thought about pardons and commutations up until now and fought off all the questions about it, no, there’s not going to be any thought about that.”\n\nI think you are right that Michael Cohen is not going to get hooked up with a pardon, nor do I think he'd accept one if he got it (which would be kind of weird, if you think about it, given he's about to go to jail for three years). \n\nBut anyway, this really applies to Paul Manafort, who is not going to be a free man until the end of 2024 by my calculation unless the president tosses him a lifeline.  No doubt, a pardon or commutation would set off all manner of political problems, and maybe some legal ones too if you consider that Manafort agreed to cooperate with Mueller's prosecutors but then got caught lying to them. \n\nSo, I can envision a Manafort reprieve stirring things up quite a bit and perhaps even becoming an article of impeachment against Trump. Fun times ahead for all involved. - Darren",

        "body": "John here:  As a criminal and a government oversight investigation, this isn't Watergate yet.  There, in 1973, the Senate's Ervin Committee was very actively investigating, including by taking lots of private testimony and then by holding extensive, continuing public hearings, and that was producing many serious allegations of presidential and senior White House official criminality.  Soon it produced information on the existence of White House tapes, and that led to the Special Prosecutor issuing subpoenas and, in Oct. 1973, winning litigation to get some of the tapes.

There, in 1973, the Senate&amp;#39;s Ervin Committee was very actively investigating, including by taking lots of private testimony and then by holding extensive, continuing public hearings, and that was producing many serious allegations of presidential and senior White House official criminality.  Soon it produced information on the existence of White House tapes, and that led to the Special Prosecutor issuing subpoenas and, in Oct. 1973, winning litigation to get some of the tapes.  Here, the House is not yet doing that kind of investigation, at least not visibly.

If so, POLITICO might want to hear about your campaign platform.\n\nSeriously, though, to your question about the Mueller probe being complete, I'll give you a technical answer and then a layman one. Technically, Mueller is done. His office turned in its final report and it's downsizing staff and before too long even Mueller himself will be back in retirement (or some other job we don't know about yet).\n\nAs for the active cases, yeah, that SCOTUS decision today deals with something close to my heart, as we at POLITICO got the [scoop](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/24/mueller-investigation-grand-jury-roger-stone-friend-938572) that this was even related to Mueller. I do think Mueller -- likely handing the case off to U.S. attorneys from the D.C. office -- will press on seeking this information via subpoena of the foreign-owned company.\n\nAnd there are other Mueller-related cases that will live on too, including the Roger Stone trial [set](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/14/roger-stone-trial-1221289) to begin Nov. 5 in DC. I've been asking my sources what happens if Stone did shift from pleading not guilty to guilty and became a government cooperator. That's a big hypothetical, but I'd presume anything he offers in such a situation would end up in DOJ/FBI hands. - Darren",

Seriously, though, we are now in a waiting period – one that I’d say will take months, not weeks -- while Attorney General William Barr and his aides go through the weeds of the report looking to remove classified and grand jury information that is not allowed to be made public. In his letter yesterday, Barr said he’d be consulting with Mueller to help find all that information “as quickly as possible.” He also said he needs to be cognizant of other “ongoing matters” like open investigations, so that will slow things down a bit, since he doesn’t want to release a report that undermines potential prosecutions. Barr reads the papers and knows there’s lots of clamor for this document. So he’ll be under pressure – especially from Democrats - to get something more out.  – Darren\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Quick update on 3/27: A DOJ official said Tuesday \\[the day after this AMA\\] that Barr’s review would take “weeks not months” so that could mean around mid-April is when we go through this whole routine again without maybe as much of the anticipation.)* ",

Seriously, though, we are now in a waiting period – one that I’d say will take months, not weeks -- while Attorney General William Barr and his aides go through the weeds of the report looking to remove classified and grand jury information that is not allowed to be made public. In his letter yesterday, Barr said he’d be consulting with Mueller to help find all that information “as quickly as possible.” He also said he needs to be cognizant of other “ongoing matters” like open investigations, so that will slow things down a bit, since he doesn’t want to release a report that undermines potential prosecutions. Barr reads the papers and knows there’s lots of clamor for this document. So he’ll be under pressure – especially from Democrats - to get something more out.  – Darren&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Quick update on 3/27: A DOJ official said Tuesday [the day after this AMA] that Barr’s review would take “weeks not months” so that could mean around mid-April is when we go through this whole routine again without maybe as much of the anticipation.)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It's arguable that #MeToo was heavily influenced by, but not necessarily a direct response to, Trump's election. But it's also arguable that a president credibly accused of sexual misconduct, caught on tape talking about the idea, is inextricably tied to the movement ... which speaks to its politicization.

That's certainly not hacking them, but it's raising the specter of it.\n\nThe U.S. government is certainly conducting cyberespionage operations against Russia and China, but the U.S. style in cyberspace to date has been to be more discreet about its operations, whereas Russia ranges from \"flagrant\" to \"just doesn't care that much if people find out, because we can't be clearly busted.\" (The U.S. has by all accounts conducted more offensive operations elsewhere, like the Stuxnet attacks on Iran's nuclear program.)\n\nThe U.S. can't target Russia's elections or China's elections because those elections have no substance. Some have suggested the U.S. could have an impact by getting into those nations' critical infrastructure like the electricity grid, and we might be there already. Some also have suggested conducting social media campaigns designed to highlight, say, the corruption of Russian oligarchs.

And Thanks so much for the kind words! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are 3 kinds of threats to election security: 1) to the voting machines themselves, 2) to the infrastructure around them like voter databases, county websites that release the results etc., and 3) to the social/media ecosystem around the voter. Each have vulnerabilities, but a key problem is that the vast majority of the attention (in the media, in politics, etc) is on the 1st and lesser extent the 2nd, which has never been done on national scale successfully. By comparison, we know that the 3rd has been done in multiple elections...and worked. It has struck everywhere from the 2016 election in the US and the Brexit vote in the UK, to the Syrian civil war and the [Myanmar genocide](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/15/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-hate-speech-investigation). This threat doesn’t come in the form of hacking networks (aka “cyberwar”) but rather hacking the people on them, by making ideas viral through a mix of “likes” and lies on social media (what we call “like war”). So, while it is unclear whether some nation is going to try to hack the machines upcoming, we know they are still trying the 3rd...as they never stopped. In the US, Russian accounts have been caught trying stir up controversy around everything from Nike’s signing of NFL star [Colin Kaepernick](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nike-boycott-colin-kaepernick-russia-twitter?utm_source=Adestra&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wired%20awake%2027.09.18&amp;utm_content=WIRED%20Awake%20September%2027%3A%20Facebook%20announces%20wireless%20Oculus%20Quest) to the upcoming midterm elections, while in Europe, [they are expected](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-russian-propagandists-try-new-tricks-n913131) to try to influence the European parliament elections in the spring, in support of far-right parties.\n\nWhatever the topic, the goal is always the same: using online means to alter real-world beliefs and actions. What makes the problem harder to deal with is that it is no longer just Russian actors that we have to keep our eye on. Examples now range from Iranian [online influence operations](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html) to mercenaries [willing to work](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/politics/rick-gates-psy-group-trump.html) for multimillionaires on single-issue campaigns. Indeed, the Brazilian election saw many of the same toxic tactics amid what has been called a “[fake news tsunami](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/brazil-fake-news-presidential-election-whatsapp-facebook)”. So our focus should be on all three, not just the voting machine part. ",

Examples now range from Iranian &lt;a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html\"&gt;online influence operations&lt;/a&gt; to mercenaries &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/politics/rick-gates-psy-group-trump.html\"&gt;willing to work&lt;/a&gt; for multimillionaires on single-issue campaigns. Indeed, the Brazilian election saw many of the same toxic tactics amid what has been called a “&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/brazil-fake-news-presidential-election-whatsapp-facebook\"&gt;fake news tsunami&lt;/a&gt;”. So our focus should be on all three, not just the voting machine part. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I was about to jump in and answer this question when we got word of a jury note (they plan to break at 5 p.m. w/o a verdict).\n\nAnyway, to your questions about Rudy and deadlines for the Mueller probe. The long and short of it is there is no real deadline of any kind on the Mueller probe. The special counsel can take as much time as he needs. Rudy, and before him Trump lawyer Ty Cobb, have been throwing out deadlines when they say the special counsel probe will end. Many of them have generated lots of headlines. But they aren't real deadlines.\n\nSure, Mueller must be mindful of the midterms and movements that can be seen as influencing voters. The Comey memories loom large (referring to his HRC email investigation press conference and then reopening the probe via letters just before the 2016 election). But there's a big difference between holding a presser and Mueller quietly investigating all the many strands of the probe, from prosecuting the Manafort trial to questioning people before the grand jury in DC.\n\nThere is no one operative DOJ policy on handling election-sensitive issues before the midterms. I've seen differing opinions on this as to when exactly the cut-off is, and the DOJ inspector general [report](https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download) from this June did a pretty good job compiling the ins and outs of what I'm talking about.\n\nA couple other thoughts: Team Trump has been plenty clear they are trying to play up impeachment in a bid to drive their base voters to the polls. You can read my Politico [piece](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/03/trump-lawyers-mueller-russia-probe-strategy-568481) about that here from this past May.\n\nAnd to toot my own horn a bit, I'd suggest reading the following pieces I've done over the last year [here](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/trump-russia-mueller-investigation-timelines/), [here](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/03/trump-lawyers-mueller-russia-probe-strategy-568481), [here](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/republicans-mueller-midterms-russia-probe-341592) that get into the politics of the Mueller probe, the mid-terms and where things are going.

It doesn't even matter if they were actually hacked. The seed of doubt alone—which the Russians are very skilled at planting—would be enough to sow confusion, anger, and a national political crisis.\n\nI would also add the seemingly-tangential evidence Mueller seems to have unearthed involving efforts by Gulf Arab  governments like Qatar and the UAE to influence Trump's foreign policy. (This is the storyline involving, among other things, the convicted pedophile George Nader, the former RNC fundraiser Elliott Broidy and allegations of big cash offered to Michael Cohen.)
