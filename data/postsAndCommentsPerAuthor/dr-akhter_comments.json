I was initially surprised when the AAP recommended going back to school. I had to read up on the literature, and it seems like what they’re using as support is that there haven’t been large outbreaks in other countries due to school classrooms. Seems like, at least for COVID, kids aren’t as big a vector as we feared. MY fear is that we’re using other countries’ data, despite the fact that CLEARLY other countries are better about following customs of distancing and masks. And we KNOW that reason the common cold and the flu spread so virulently during the ‘winter’ is bc kids are in school. So much so that, in fact, in the summer in Arizona – when people are MORE likely to be indoors rather than during our winters – our flu season is STILL during the ‘winter.’ Kids pass it to adults, people travel, and then it spreads in Arizona about a month after flu season everywhere else. So, is COVID miraculously different? Perhaps. And even if it isn’t, I suppose if ONLY kids get it, they do seem to be very resilient. But how will you prevent kids from seeing elderly people? Or immunocompromised people? Those people can get extremely sick. And, as my wife mentioned (she’s a teacher, and was at Title I schools), how about the kids who clearly live with their grandparents b/c their families are poor? Are we neglecting the inability of poor people (and don’t forget the racial implications) to distance so that we can send more well off (and whiter) kids to school? Those are my fears. Again, there are data suggesting that schools may not be massive outbreak centers. But those data seem to contradict everything else we’ve seen from other virii - and they come from other countries as of now. If everyone could distance, school would probably be ok.

I almost wish there were a prediction market for masks/distancing/etc. We know people are more honest/accurate when they put their money on the line. Things are polarized needlessly (when did science become polarized this much??), but imagine if people had to ‘bet’ on whether masks worked or not. I bet you (no pun intended) that the odds would heavily favor that masks help. Easy to get ‘outraged’ and admittedly maybe that’s even why I’m on air – the media seems to love that crap – sbut when you put your own money on the line, which stock are you going to bet on? Even the idiots spouting conspiracy theories would be tempered on the prediction markets …&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

MY fear is that we’re using other countries’ data, despite the fact that CLEARLY other countries are better about following customs of distancing and masks.

So much so that, in fact, in the summer in Arizona – when people are MORE likely to be indoors rather than during our winters – our flu season is STILL during the ‘winter.’ Kids pass it to adults, people travel, and then it spreads in Arizona about a month after flu season everywhere else. So, is COVID miraculously different? Perhaps. And even if it isn’t, I suppose if ONLY kids get it, they do seem to be very resilient. But how will you prevent kids from seeing elderly people? Or immunocompromised people? Those people can get extremely sick. And, as my wife mentioned (she’s a teacher, and was at Title I schools), how about the kids who clearly live with their grandparents b/c their families are poor? Are we neglecting the inability of poor people (and don’t forget the racial implications) to distance so that we can send more well off (and whiter) kids to school? Those are my fears. Again, there are data suggesting that schools may not be massive outbreak centers.

So, despite my feeling sometimes like what I’m doing is futile, these people give me a lot of energy. But I don’t know what it’s like to be working solo, or with a couple of colleagues, and then go home and realize that so many other people are pretending that this pandemic isn’t real. I’ve definitely had moments where I felt demoralized; so far, I’ve been lucky to at least be surrounded by people who keep my energy up. But we’re all human …&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You all have heard 14 days – that is because we think within 14 days, people who are sick will “declare” themselves, as in, exhibit symptoms. The most contagious part – for someone who is sick – is the first few days of the virus, but that doesn’t mean that they suddenly stop being contagious after that! CDC guideline is that isolate for at least three days after symptoms resolve. Keep in mind, ACTUAL resolution of symptoms takes quite a while. Then three days of symptom-FREE isolation, and then can stop being quarantining (but still need to distance, as always!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
