It seems to affect everyone differently and to different degrees, but everyone is effected. And we're each looking for that silver lining. Specific news about the virus fluctuates so rapidly that it's hard to find even ground, even when there *is* a success to celebrate.\n\nInstead, I think most of us look elsewhere for the break. We're thankful for the technology (and recognize its many flaws) that has allowed us to have some semblance of contact in virtual space that simply wouldn't have been possible a decade or two ago. We also try to celebrate the little adaptations that wouldn't have happened otherwise. For instance, getting a unique glimpse into our coworkers lives now that we're constantly \"live from home.\" [This NYT Op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/opinion/coronavirus-zoom-celebrities.html) touches on this idea. This just wouldn't have happened with everyone reporting to the office as usual.\n\nFor me, the early and continued examples of society uniting under isolation were so encouraging and I try to look for it and appreciate it. For instance the effect of #FlattenTheCurve trending is a huge win for Science Communication and social media. On a wonderfully human note, [this viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Rle1YS5Fs) of a Spanish fitness instructor holding classes from their balcony for their community showed how people are working to get through this together, despite so much stress in the media and on social media. Then there are new online opportunities popping up everywhere, many free, like these [free online courses](https://www.coursera.org/moma) from the MOMA. I reached out to a loved one who I can't see right now suggesting we take a course together to create opportunity for more interaction.\n\nNone of this could possibly replace being physically separated from our loved ones. But thank you for diligently practicing social distancing.

If you see yourself working in government or industry, many organizations really value the opinions of somebody with scientific training, even on policy issues, since you’ve been trained with a detailed, methodical way of thinking that really benefits good, evidence-based policy. \n\nFinally — remember that policy isn’t just what happens in government, but any sort of decision made by an institution that affects people’s livelihoods. Your university makes a lot of policies for its students/faculty/staff, for example, that are surely affecting you, and many of those policies require science/tech understanding or training (for instance, some universities are starting to allow research labs to open again, even if other employees are still working at home.)

        "body": "**Nita:** There are a few questions in here, and I’ll try to address them in turn. Let’s start with the first one, which is mask-wearing for all. There is interesting historical data on this one, that with mask-wearing in particular, society seems to grapple with this restriction more than others. Some have posited that there is something about face covering that impacts human interactions in a way that makes it particularly difficult to accept. But public reaction can likely be explained by a number of things, ranging from concerns about impact on individual liberty, to a lack of understanding about the benefit of mask wearing, to poor communication by leaders about the science and rationale underlying mask wearing, to mistrust of science, to mistrust of public officials (particularly given early missteps about communication about masks).\n\nThe data is somewhat mixed on how effective cloth masks are, and this is in part because there are so many variables in cloth mask wearing. Such as the many different materials being used, the variation in the fit of masks, the behavior of individuals wearing those masks, etc. But at least for all the data I’ve seen, it doesn’t hurt (so long as you’re using safe materials with adequate breathability, and it’s not causing you to touch your face much more often, etc.), and likely helps. How much it helps is still unclear and will vary based on all of the above variables.\n\nAs for what would have happened if there weren’t early mis-steps with respect to recommendations on mask wearing, I wish we could quantify it. But I thought the Surgeon General’s tweet on this was utterly maddening and very poor science communication.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nita:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a few questions in here, and I’ll try to address them in turn. Let’s start with the first one, which is mask-wearing for all. There is interesting historical data on this one, that with mask-wearing in particular, society seems to grapple with this restriction more than others. Some have posited that there is something about face covering that impacts human interactions in a way that makes it particularly difficult to accept. But public reaction can likely be explained by a number of things, ranging from concerns about impact on individual liberty, to a lack of understanding about the benefit of mask wearing, to poor communication by leaders about the science and rationale underlying mask wearing, to mistrust of science, to mistrust of public officials (particularly given early missteps about communication about masks).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data is somewhat mixed on how effective cloth masks are, and this is in part because there are so many variables in cloth mask wearing. Such as the many different materials being used, the variation in the fit of masks, the behavior of individuals wearing those masks, etc. But at least for all the data I’ve seen, it doesn’t hurt (so long as you’re using safe materials with adequate breathability, and it’s not causing you to touch your face much more often, etc.), and likely helps. How much it helps is still unclear and will vary based on all of the above variables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for what would have happened if there weren’t early mis-steps with respect to recommendations on mask wearing, I wish we could quantify it. But I thought the Surgeon General’s tweet on this was utterly maddening and very poor science communication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Who are considered the most vulnerable at that time? What is the safety data on the vaccine? What is the effectiveness of the vaccine?Let’s assume it’s safe and effective. But it’s in limited supply. Principles of bioethics would suggest that we ought to give it first to those that are the most in need (e.g. most likely to be exposed, most likely to become critically ill as a result). We ought also to consider those populations on whom it was tested and ensure that those who exposed themselves to risk to enable the development of the vaccine can also benefit from it.\n\n**Buz:** First, understand - no vaccine is 100% safe.  many of the side effects may not be revealed until after extensive use.  You ask a question to which we don't yet know the answers.  Will it be paid for by the govt and offered free to all?  Will it be available only to people with insurance?  Are there sub-populations who are more at risk for adverse events?  Will the manufacturers be able to meet demand? Will all of the required ingredients be available in the US or will we be dependent on foreign supply?  Sorry to answer the question with more questions.\n\n**Thomas:** With respect to the question of identifying the vaccinated, it presents a tricky question. In China, they are now utilizing an app which identifies individuals who have had the disease - this creates a new class system at some level. Those in the green in the color code system are able to go to restaurants, use the subway, etc.; others are subject to monitoring if they violate quarantine orders. Others are denied and may be subject to further monitoring. States have the authority to require immunization to attend schools, and universities create similar policies. We'll have to wait and see what actions are taken when a vaccine comes to market, but this will almost certainly have some variance and poke the bear of inequity in ways that aren't hard to imagine.\n\nTo jump on to Nita's train of thought, since we also see this pandemic impact communities on the margins with far greater impact while they have far more limited access to care and appropriate housing, we may also consider those factors as we roll out a vaccine to insure a hotspot there doesn't become an enormous outbreak more generally",
