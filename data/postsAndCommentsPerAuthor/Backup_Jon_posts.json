Between the six of us answering questions, we have over 60 years of Veritas Backup Exec experience, however we say “almost” anything in the title because we will not be able to answer broader Veritas questions that aren’t specific to Backup Exec. \n\nWe know there will likely be some venting here, but keep in mind if there isn’t a question in a post we likely won’t be able to answer it. However, we are open to all forms of feedback – positive and negative – so long as it is constructive, and we will do our best to provide candid answers.\n\nOur plan is to be actively answering questions in the following two time windows:\n\nJuly 16th 9 AM – 12PM Pacific Time \n\nJuly 17th 11 AM – 1PM Australian Eastern Standard Time – for our friends across the pacific\n\nSo who are we?\n\nBackupMikko – **Mikko** Product Manager, long-time Reddit user, first time AMA participant. Comes from the land of Linux and Saunas.\n\nBrian_Says_So – **Brian** Global Enablement Specialist, has been with Veritas in various roles, including development, consulting, sales engineering and marketing. \nBackupExec_Bot_v1 – **Alex** National Architect at Veritas.\n\nBE_Elias – **Elias** Project manager for our Customer Partner Engagement Program (CPEP), Elias regularly interacts with the community to ensure our customers and partners have a voice in everything we do\n\nBackup_Renee – **Renee** is a Supportability Manager for Backup Exec who start in support and has worked in professional services, education, and release readiness roles. \n\nBackup_Jon – **Jonathan** Self-admitted rookie of the group, I’ve been at Veritas for a couple of years - primarily in technical sales supporting our entire portfolio, but Backup Exec holds a special place in my heart.\n\n\n[proof](https://twitter.com/VeritasTechLLC/status/1283788236289200129)\n\n\n**Some Background for those unfamiliar with Information Technology and data protection**: Almost every business has some form of Information Technology on the backend which makes it possible to provide important services to their customers. Whether it is a simple website, an inventory database, or an ATM application that keeps track of personal transactions across the entire bank, these systems almost always have data at their core – and losing that data can frequently be unacceptable. For example, if you deposited money into a checking account and a week later there was no record of that transaction, you wouldn’t be happy. That’s where backup and recovery come in – regular backups allow organizations to recover data when the unexpected occurs, such as an accidental push of the “delete” key. \n\nBackup Exec is designed to protect and recover a wide breadth of possible IT infrastructures and workloads (i.e. MS SQL, VMware, Amazon Web Services, and many more!) Our latest version focuses on security – with an ever-increasing threat of ransomware it’s important that your backup application, your last line of defense, protects itself from malicious code and users.\n\n**edit** Alright everyone thanks for the questions, we'll be back at 11AM AEST to answer more - but we're taking a break for now!\n\n**edit 2** We're back for the next round of questions\n\n**Edit 3** : Hey everyone, most of us are signing off – thanks for all your feedback and questions. We are constantly impressed by the passion and expertise of the Reddit Community and we plan to stay engaged. If you have further questions feel free to reach out to us individually, we will also be checking in on Sysadmin. The world may never know who lost the bet…",
