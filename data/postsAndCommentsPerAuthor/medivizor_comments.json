You should know, entrepreneurship in health can, on one hand, be very rewarding, and on the other hand, extremely challenging. Entrepreneurship, generally speaking, is much more difficult than it is made out to be by most accounts and stories. It is mostly glamorized but extremely challenging - both professionally, and personally, as it has many ups and downs and requires a very wide variety of skills and activities. In health - if you innovate in something that has a direct impact, you may be able to see and feel the results and rewards more readily, but many innovations often take years to reach that point where they do have an impact. \n\nTogether, you are a good team - having an understanding of the medical practice and its challenges exposes your sister to a whole slew of problems. And problems are opportunities for entrepreneurs. Then, you need to really research and figure out if this is a problem just locally in the environment you exhibit it, or is it a more general problem and how the world is going about solving it + what are people doing to address it in future. The fact someone is working on solving a problem is both good and bad. You may shy away assuming you have competition. But imagine what happens if this competitor falters? So knowing of some competition is usually a good thing - it means the problem may be worth solving. It’s vital to know the total commercial value of solving the problem, not just its benefit on people. You need to learn a lot about how to create the solution and commercialize and distribute it. There is really so much to learn.\n\nOnce you’ve identified the problem and have a solution in mind, but you may lack some of the experience, your team may want to join an accelerator or incubator, that could help. There are many health tech-focused incubators and accelerators that can provide the mentorship, guidance, and learnings that you need plus access to capital and possible customers and distributors. \n\nSo, the first thing - find problems. Second, find new/novel solutions to those problems. Third, figure out if they’re worth solving. Finally, go about setting up a team that can achieve this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is really just the tip of the iceberg on doing this. And as I said, rewarding, and extremely challenging. Health tech is fascinating - but it’s not for the faint of heart!",

Even I decided to start yet another company specifically aiming to help in the pandemic ([Track Virus](https://track-virus.com)). Innovators around the world are rapidly shifting their solutions to help in any way they can in the pandemic - to slow the spread of the disease, track it, help accelerate recovery of the economy, and in many other areas. I’ve been tracking hundreds of such initiatives. \n\nAlso, digital health is a much better vehicle to deliver healthcare services when physically distancing and quarantine is in place. So telemedicine, for example, has really finally emerged as a viable mechanism to receive care. Teleconsultation - ranging from chat, audio, video, and other sensors - are all being used to avoid physically going to the office. And this is just one obvious example. But every discipline in medicine is adjusting. Of course, this is impacting many other fields.\n\nOverall, there is also a surge of investment in the digital health space, whereas many other fields have seen a reduction in their investments. This is mostly noted where there is a direct tie to the pandemic or areas impacted by the pandemic.",

Even I decided to start yet another company specifically aiming to help in the pandemic (&lt;a href=\"https://track-virus.com\"&gt;Track Virus&lt;/a&gt;). Innovators around the world are rapidly shifting their solutions to help in any way they can in the pandemic - to slow the spread of the disease, track it, help accelerate recovery of the economy, and in many other areas. I’ve been tracking hundreds of such initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, digital health is a much better vehicle to deliver healthcare services when physically distancing and quarantine is in place. So telemedicine, for example, has really finally emerged as a viable mechanism to receive care. Teleconsultation - ranging from chat, audio, video, and other sensors - are all being used to avoid physically going to the office. And this is just one obvious example. But every discipline in medicine is adjusting. Of course, this is impacting many other fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is also a surge of investment in the digital health space, whereas many other fields have seen a reduction in their investments. This is mostly noted where there is a direct tie to the pandemic or areas impacted by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

[Medivizor](http://medivizor.com)'s [stated mission](https://medivizor.com/info.html) is to \"improve the lives of people with serious or chronic medical conditions and of those who care for them.\"\n\nPeople can sign up anonymously. One does not need to provide a name, an address, a telephone number, a social security number, or any other \"identifying\" information. Anybody can invent a nickname of how we'll refer to them and use a disposable email if you want to test the service. Also you can always unsubscribe very easily from the service.\n\nThe reason an email address is required is that because there's a high degree of personalization of the content, and a large portion of the value is realized over time - with the notifications of new information. Without some sort of way to get back to the people over time, much of the experience is lost. , there's really no point in the service without being able to send information back to the subscribers.\n\nCheck out what others are saying about Medivizor's service:\n- [Journeying Beyond Breast Cancer](http://journeyingbeyondbreastcancer.com/2013/09/17/from-diagnosis-to-empowerment-anne-maries-story/)\n- [Diabetes Mine Blog Post](http://www.diabetesmine.com/2013/04/new-online-tool-helps-filter-diabetes-news.html)\n- [Bella Online](http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art181097.asp)\nAnd [dozens others](http://bit.ly/medivizornews).\n\nAlso, various non-profit organizations, such as the Diabetes Hands Foundation, the [Colon Cancer Coalition](http://www.getyourrearingearblog.com/featured-articles/medivizor-customized-information-for-patients-and-families/), the Colon Cancer Foundation, and the Melanoma Foundation of New England have all endorsed Medivizor after careful scrutiny of the service.\n\nAlan_s and mistral7, I encourage you to try out the service and report back your findings after using it. \n\n\n",
