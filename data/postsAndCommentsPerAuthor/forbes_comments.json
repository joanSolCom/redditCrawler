Will it be like the flu where you have to get one every year? It's not yet clear). I do think reopening will happen before a vaccine, as we're seeing in China, other parts of Asia and even parts of Europe. If that's done thoughtfully - using best advice from public health officials - then widespread testing and contact tracing may enable stay-at-home orders to be lifted. If it's done too quickly or too haphazardly, historical lessons from pandemics like the 1918 flu would suggest we might see subsequent waves of infection that might require another round of stay-at-home orders. I am hopeful that there will soon be better treatments for at least the most severe COVID-19 cases - there are several clinical trials happening right now. At the end of the day, it's hard to say. This is a brand-new disease and there's so much that we still don't know. Scientists are learning more every day and in some cases revising our previous understanding on the fly, but there are still a lot of unknowns. One thing that gives me hope is the remarkable way that scientists, businesses, nonprofits and governments have really come together to collaborate on finding solutions.",

If possible, employers should consider offering flexibility in an employee’s schedule when an employee first returns to work. Also, supervisors and managers should be made aware that employees may need extra support as they transition back to work, like checking in with employees that are returning and reminding them about the EAP benefit if they experience stress, caregiving, financial and related issues.\n\nEmployers should also be aware of postpartum depression, as an issue that could come up and to know how to respond should they see significant changes in an employee’s attendance, performance and demeanor. Some changes should be expected, however if the changes are significant, it would be important for a supervisor or manager to check in and to ask an employee, is everything ok, and to point to specific behaviors that are well outside the norm for that person. - DEG\n\nAllowing remote or flexible work options creates a more equitable workforce and reduces the friction between new parents’ personal and professional lives. Companies can extend parental leave policies, enabling new parents to further bond with their infants, provide lactation rooms or milk delivery services for new moms and offer on-site or discounted childcare services. On the parental side, communicate with your higher-ups and lobby for what you need and the limits you are setting on workload. - RU",

If possible, employers should consider offering flexibility in an employee’s schedule when an employee first returns to work. Also, supervisors and managers should be made aware that employees may need extra support as they transition back to work, like checking in with employees that are returning and reminding them about the EAP benefit if they experience stress, caregiving, financial and related issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Employers should also be aware of postpartum depression, as an issue that could come up and to know how to respond should they see significant changes in an employee’s attendance, performance and demeanor. Some changes should be expected, however if the changes are significant, it would be important for a supervisor or manager to check in and to ask an employee, is everything ok, and to point to specific behaviors that are well outside the norm for that person. - DEG&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allowing remote or flexible work options creates a more equitable workforce and reduces the friction between new parents’ personal and professional lives. Companies can extend parental leave policies, enabling new parents to further bond with their infants, provide lactation rooms or milk delivery services for new moms and offer on-site or discounted childcare services. On the parental side, communicate with your higher-ups and lobby for what you need and the limits you are setting on workload. - RU&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Then you go back through and look at what are the changes since he became president. For example, you can look at the Doral golf course. Revenues there are way down, largely because customers from the northeast (a liberal leaning area) are less inclined to book events at Trump’s course. We value that course, in part, based on a multiple of revenues. So if Trump’s revenues have declined by a certain amount (which they have--he discloses that on his annual financial filings), then you can apply that multiple and figure out how much that decrease in revenues has cost him.\n\nThe same principles apply for assets where he has benefitted. Take, for instance, his penthouse in Manhattan. We call up a bunch of brokers in New York to see how much they think it is worth. This is an exercise we’ve done for years, long before he was president. But now that he is commander-in-chief, they’re applying a premium to his penthouse. That’s a gain from the presidency. \n\nEvery asset is different, and if you’d like to know about a specific one, I’d be happy to answer that.

Take, for instance, his penthouse in Manhattan. We call up a bunch of brokers in New York to see how much they think it is worth. This is an exercise we’ve done for years, long before he was president. But now that he is commander-in-chief, they’re applying a premium to his penthouse. That’s a gain from the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every asset is different, and if you’d like to know about a specific one, I’d be happy to answer that. But this story gives an overall look at it: &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/10/02/how-trump-is-tryingand-failingto-get-rich-off-his-presidency/\"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/10/02/how-trump-is-tryingand-failingto-get-rich-off-his-presidency/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

By using data pulled from Trump’s lenders, we can figure out the profitability. Using data from local authorities, we can figure out square footage. We then call up a bunch of people who spend all day long buying and selling assets in these markets. They provide us estimates of what multiples, say, a building on Fifth Avenue with net operating income of $14 million might produce.

But remember, Trump’s assets are mostly real estate, so lenders record mortgages against those assets, which are public records. And many of the loans, which aren’t recorded, have been chopped up and sold off to investors on Wall Street, so that information is public too. In addition, Trump discloses many of his loans with the federal government. Is there a chance that Trump has some secret loan? Sure. But what is the likelihood that someone would have given him a bunch of money before he became president without securing that debt with collateral? Pretty unlikely. If he got some secret loan since becoming president, well then he would have a surge of cash, but also an outstanding liability, so those two things would cancel out from a net worth perspective.\n\nBottom line: There are much bigger questions around Trump’s income than there are around his assets and liabilities, which determine net worth.

I do think reopening will happen before a vaccine, as we're seeing in China, other parts of Asia and even parts of Europe. If that's done thoughtfully - using best advice from public health officials - then widespread testing and contact tracing may enable stay-at-home orders to be lifted.

I am hopeful that there will soon be better treatments for at least the most severe COVID-19 cases - there are several clinical trials happening right now. At the end of the day, it's hard to say.

But there are such trials underway and I’m eager to see what happens. Right now, just based on what I’ve seen, I think what’s most generally promising are 1. Plasma-derived therapies, where antibodies are taken from recovered patients, isolated and then given to patients with COVID-19; and 2. Several classes of immunotherapies we already use with cancer to reduce the hyperimmune response that causes the lung damage we see in the most severe cases. But my hopes for those are ultimately going to depend on what the data shows. We should see some of the first clinical trial results for some therapies as early as May, so we’ll know soon.",

But there are such trials underway and I’m eager to see what happens. Right now, just based on what I’ve seen, I think what’s most generally promising are 1. Plasma-derived therapies, where antibodies are taken from recovered patients, isolated and then given to patients with COVID-19; and 2. Several classes of immunotherapies we already use with cancer to reduce the hyperimmune response that causes the lung damage we see in the most severe cases. But my hopes for those are ultimately going to depend on what the data shows. We should see some of the first clinical trial results for some therapies as early as May, so we’ll know soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It looks like Fox Business just cites Celebrity Net Worth, and I don’t know how they calculated their numbers.

During that time, he did take out debt on a number of assets (Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, Doral, Trump Chicago, D.C. hotel, etc.) But several of the golf courses don’t appear to have any debt on them. \n\nIt’s possible that he paid in cash for this stuff. Remember, Trump brings in about $175 million in rent every year from his commercial properties (https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/02/13/trump-conflicts-of-interest-tenants-donald-business-organization-real-estate-assets-pay). And he got a massive payout of $125 million or so in relation to his properties at 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street (https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/03/07/trumps-secret-windfall-the-crown-jewels-of-his-fortune-are-2-skyscrapers-he-didnt-wantand-doesnt-control). But still, all of those cash purchases leave you wondering. We’re still hunting for information. Let us know if you have any tips!\n\nOn this cash question, I should credit David Fahrenthold, Jonathan O’Connell and Jack Gillum at the Washington Post, who have done great work on Trump’s finances: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-the-king-of-debt-trump-borrowed-to-build-his-empire-then-he-began-spending-hundreds-of-millions-in-cash/2018/05/05/28fe54b4-44c4-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html",

During that time, he did take out debt on a number of assets (Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, Doral, Trump Chicago, D.C. hotel, etc.) But several of the golf courses don’t appear to have any debt on them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that he paid in cash for this stuff. Remember, Trump brings in about $175 million in rent every year from his commercial properties (&lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/02/13/trump-conflicts-of-interest-tenants-donald-business-organization-real-estate-assets-pay\"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2018/02/13/trump-conflicts-of-interest-tenants-donald-business-organization-real-estate-assets-pay&lt;/a&gt;). And he got a massive payout of $125 million or so in relation to his properties at 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street (&lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/03/07/trumps-secret-windfall-the-crown-jewels-of-his-fortune-are-2-skyscrapers-he-didnt-wantand-doesnt-control\"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/03/07/trumps-secret-windfall-the-crown-jewels-of-his-fortune-are-2-skyscrapers-he-didnt-wantand-doesnt-control&lt;/a&gt;). But still, all of those cash purchases leave you wondering. We’re still hunting for information. Let us know if you have any tips!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On this cash question, I should credit David Fahrenthold, Jonathan O’Connell and Jack Gillum at the Washington Post, who have done great work on Trump’s finances: &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-the-king-of-debt-trump-borrowed-to-build-his-empire-then-he-began-spending-hundreds-of-millions-in-cash/2018/05/05/28fe54b4-44c4-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html\"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-the-king-of-debt-trump-borrowed-to-build-his-empire-then-he-began-spending-hundreds-of-millions-in-cash/2018/05/05/28fe54b4-44c4-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But I wasn’t sure if we’d be able to track it all down. Over the course of about a year, we kept gathering stuff, until finally, we hit a breaking point and realized we could do the story.

One particularly painful experience was working on closing a house for months, only to discover that the past three owners had passed along a home-addition that didn’t comply with VILLAGE code. So the state was fine, the city was fine, but some obscure village ordinance had been violated and for decades no one caught it. Then, just days before we got the property someone discovered a wall was a couple feet too close to a property line and we had to start over from scratch.

One particularly painful experience was working on closing a house for months, only to discover that the past three owners had passed along a home-addition that didn’t comply with VILLAGE code. So the state was fine, the city was fine, but some obscure village ordinance had been violated and for decades no one caught it. Then, just days before we got the property someone discovered a wall was a couple feet too close to a property line and we had to start over from scratch. This would be unacceptable in any other business, and I can’t wait until all property records are on a shared ledger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

My biggest annoyance is trying to ask about a past release or something unrelated to an immediate concert tour and it getting nixed. \n\nK-pop is obviously a scene very much enhanced by imagery and there are valid reasons why artists won’t comment on certain topics because of public opinion. But sometimes I’ll submit a question that I know will 100% get rejected because I want people in management companies to know that I consider this serious journalism and do truly want to know their artists thoughts on some topics. At KCON, I submitted a question about #metoo to EXID based on their Ah Yeah video. Needless to say, I doubt the group even knew that topic was on the table. ",
