On the first night, three [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force) (USAF) [EC-130Es](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_EC-130) (Call signs: *Republic 4*, *5*, and *6*) carrying the logistical supplies and three [MC-130E Combat Talons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_MC-130) (Call signs: *Dragon 1*, *2*, and *3*) carrying Delta Force and Ranger troops would depart the island of [Masirah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masirah), off the coast of [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman), be refueled by Air Force [KC-135](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC-135) tankers, and fly to \"Desert One\" ([33°04′23″N 55°53′33″E](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Operation_Eagle_Claw&amp;params=33_04_23_N_55_53_33_E_)) in the [Dasht-e Lut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasht-e_Lut) desert, a flight of over 1,000 miles. Desert One would be secured and established with a protection force and approximately 6,000 US gallons (22,700 L) of jet fuel would be carried in collapsible fuel bladders.\n\nThe ground force consisted of 93 Delta soldiers to assault the embassy, a 13-man special forces assault team from Detachment \"A\" Berlin Brigade to assault the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where three further hostages were being held, 12 [Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers) forming the roadblock team, and 15 Iranian and American [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language)\\-speakers, most of whom would act as truck drivers.\n\nEight [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy) (USN) [RH-53D Sea Stallion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_CH-53_Sea_Stallion) (Call signs: *Bluebeard 1 - 8*)[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-:0-12) helicopters were positioned aboard the [USS *Nimitz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz_(CVN-68)), 60 miles off the coast of Iran.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-Buck-13) The helicopters would fly 600 miles to Desert One, refuel, and fly the soldiers 260 miles (420 km) further to Desert Two ([35°14′00″N 52°09′00″E](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Operation_Eagle_Claw&amp;params=35_14_00_N_52_09_00_E_)), located 50 miles (80 km) short of Tehran. Because it would be close to morning, the helicopters and ground forces would hide during the day at Desert Two. The rescue operation would take place the second night. First, CIA agents who were already inside Iran would bring trucks they had sourced to Desert Two. Together, the CIA agents and ground forces would then drive from Desert Two into Tehran. An Army Ranger company would capture the abandoned Manzariyeh Air Base near Tehran to allow several [C-141 Starlifters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-141_Starlifter) flying from [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia) to arrive.\n\nThe ground troops in Tehran would assault the embassy, eliminate the guards, and rescue the hostages, with air support from Air Force [AC-130](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-130) gunships. The hostages and troops would then rendezvous with the helicopters which had flown from Desert Two to the nearby [Amjadieh Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Shiroudi_Stadium). Finally, the helicopters would bring everyone to the Manzariyeh airbase, where the C-141s would fly everyone back to an airbase in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt). The eight helicopters would be destroyed before departure.\n\nProtection for the operation was to be provided by [Carrier Air Wing Eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Eight) (CVW-8) operating from *Nimitz* and [Carrier Air Wing Fourteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Fourteen) (CVW-14) operating from the [USS *Coral Sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Coral_Sea_(CV-43)). For this operation, the aircraft bore special invasion stripes identification on their right wings. CVW-14 Marine F-4Ns had a red (VMFA-323) or yellow (VMFA-531) stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-14 attack aircraft (A-7s and A-6s) had an orange stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-8 aircraft were marked in a similar fashion to help differentiate US aircraft from Iranian aircraft purchased from the US (F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms).[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-britannica-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-15)",

Desert One would be secured and established with a protection force and approximately 6,000 US gallons (22,700 L) of jet fuel would be carried in collapsible fuel bladders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ground force consisted of 93 Delta soldiers to assault the embassy, a 13-man special forces assault team from Detachment &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; Berlin Brigade to assault the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where three further hostages were being held, 12 &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; forming the roadblock team, and 15 Iranian and American &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;-speakers, most of whom would act as truck drivers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eight &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; (USN) &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_CH-53_Sea_Stallion\"&gt;RH-53D Sea Stallion&lt;/a&gt; (Call signs: &lt;em&gt;Bluebeard 1 - 8&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-:0-12\"&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; helicopters were positioned aboard the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz_(CVN-68\"&gt;USS &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), 60 miles off the coast of Iran.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-Buck-13\"&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; The helicopters would fly 600 miles to Desert One, refuel, and fly the soldiers 260 miles (420 km) further to Desert Two (&lt;a href=\"https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Operation_Eagle_Claw&amp;amp;params=35_14_00_N_52_09_00_E_\"&gt;35°14′00″N 52°09′00″E&lt;/a&gt;), located 50 miles (80 km) short of Tehran. Because it would be close to morning, the helicopters and ground forces would hide during the day at Desert Two. The rescue operation would take place the second night. First, CIA agents who were already inside Iran would bring trucks they had sourced to Desert Two. Together, the CIA agents and ground forces would then drive from Desert Two into Tehran. An Army Ranger company would capture the abandoned Manzariyeh Air Base near Tehran to allow several &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-141_Starlifter\"&gt;C-141 Starlifters&lt;/a&gt; flying from &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ground troops in Tehran would assault the embassy, eliminate the guards, and rescue the hostages, with air support from Air Force &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-130\"&gt;AC-130&lt;/a&gt; gunships. The hostages and troops would then rendezvous with the helicopters which had flown from Desert Two to the nearby &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Shiroudi_Stadium\"&gt;Amjadieh Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the helicopters would bring everyone to the Manzariyeh airbase, where the C-141s would fly everyone back to an airbase in &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The eight helicopters would be destroyed before departure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Protection for the operation was to be provided by &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Eight\"&gt;Carrier Air Wing Eight&lt;/a&gt; (CVW-8) operating from &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Fourteen\"&gt;Carrier Air Wing Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; (CVW-14) operating from the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Coral_Sea_(CV-43\"&gt;USS &lt;em&gt;Coral Sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). For this operation, the aircraft bore special invasion stripes identification on their right wings. CVW-14 Marine F-4Ns had a red (VMFA-323) or yellow (VMFA-531) stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-14 attack aircraft (A-7s and A-6s) had an orange stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-8 aircraft were marked in a similar fashion to help differentiate US aircraft from Iranian aircraft purchased from the US (F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms).&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-britannica-14\"&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-15\"&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

(I make sure not to have any paradise in the background on my web cam.) At the same time, mainland workers also get more critical of your output -- they assume you&amp;#39;re on semi-vacation and slacking, so you want to make an extra effort to hit deadlines and be flexible with the mainland schedule for appointment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Desert One would be secured and established with a protection force and approximately 6,000 US gallons (22,700 L) of jet fuel would be carried in collapsible fuel bladders.\n\nThe ground force consisted of 93 Delta soldiers to assault the embassy, a 13-man special forces assault team from Detachment \"A\" Berlin Brigade to assault the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where three further hostages were being held, 12 [Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers) forming the roadblock team, and 15 Iranian and American [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language)\\-speakers, most of whom would act as truck drivers.\n\nEight [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy) (USN) [RH-53D Sea Stallion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_CH-53_Sea_Stallion) (Call signs: *Bluebeard 1 - 8*)[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-:0-12) helicopters were positioned aboard the [USS *Nimitz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz_(CVN-68)), 60 miles off the coast of Iran.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-Buck-13) The helicopters would fly 600 miles to Desert One, refuel, and fly the soldiers 260 miles (420 km) further to Desert Two ([35°14′00″N 52°09′00″E](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Operation_Eagle_Claw&amp;params=35_14_00_N_52_09_00_E_)), located 50 miles (80 km) short of Tehran. Because it would be close to morning, the helicopters and ground forces would hide during the day at Desert Two. The rescue operation would take place the second night. First, CIA agents who were already inside Iran would bring trucks they had sourced to Desert Two. Together, the CIA agents and ground forces would then drive from Desert Two into Tehran. An Army Ranger company would capture the abandoned Manzariyeh Air Base near Tehran to allow several [C-141 Starlifters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-141_Starlifter) flying from [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia) to arrive.\n\nThe ground troops in Tehran would assault the embassy, eliminate the guards, and rescue the hostages, with air support from Air Force [AC-130](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-130) gunships. The hostages and troops would then rendezvous with the helicopters which had flown from Desert Two to the nearby [Amjadieh Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Shiroudi_Stadium). Finally, the helicopters would bring everyone to the Manzariyeh airbase, where the C-141s would fly everyone back to an airbase in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt). The eight helicopters would be destroyed before departure.\n\nProtection for the operation was to be provided by [Carrier Air Wing Eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Eight) (CVW-8) operating from *Nimitz* and [Carrier Air Wing Fourteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Fourteen) (CVW-14) operating from the [USS *Coral Sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Coral_Sea_(CV-43)). For this operation, the aircraft bore special invasion stripes identification on their right wings. CVW-14 Marine F-4Ns had a red (VMFA-323) or yellow (VMFA-531) stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-14 attack aircraft (A-7s and A-6s) had an orange stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-8 aircraft were marked in a similar fashion to help differentiate US aircraft from Iranian aircraft purchased from the US (F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms).[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-britannica-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-15)",

The eight helicopters would be destroyed before departure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Protection for the operation was to be provided by &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Eight\"&gt;Carrier Air Wing Eight&lt;/a&gt; (CVW-8) operating from &lt;em&gt;Nimitz&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Air_Wing_Fourteen\"&gt;Carrier Air Wing Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; (CVW-14) operating from the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Coral_Sea_(CV-43\"&gt;USS &lt;em&gt;Coral Sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). For this operation, the aircraft bore special invasion stripes identification on their right wings. CVW-14 Marine F-4Ns had a red (VMFA-323) or yellow (VMFA-531) stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-14 attack aircraft (A-7s and A-6s) had an orange stripe enclosed by two black stripes. CVW-8 aircraft were marked in a similar fashion to help differentiate US aircraft from Iranian aircraft purchased from the US (F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms).&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-britannica-14\"&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw#cite_note-15\"&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The eventual Dem nominee will fight for his endorsement, and in return, they will promise to put him in charge of test piloting the Freedom Dividend or even appoint him to a cabinet level position where he can do that. Democrat leadership knows Yang has the power to pull in independents and Republicans like no one else in the party, and will be particularly powerful campaigning in the all-crucial, must-win Rust Belt. A Yang endorsement and him campaigning there for the eventual Dem nominee is enough to win each of those states.\n\nBelieve me—and I say this as someone with some experience in Dem insider politics—dropping out now is the best possible outcome. This moment was always inevitable barring a miracle, but it comes at a time when he still has a lot of the spotlight and supporter energy.\n\nYou know Yang can do right now?

The eventual Dem nominee will fight for his endorsement, and in return, they will promise to put him in charge of test piloting the Freedom Dividend or even appoint him to a cabinet level position where he can do that. Democrat leadership knows Yang has the power to pull in independents and Republicans like no one else in the party, and will be particularly powerful campaigning in the all-crucial, must-win Rust Belt. A Yang endorsement and him campaigning there for the eventual Dem nominee is enough to win each of those states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe me—and I say this as someone with some experience in Dem insider politics—dropping out now is the best possible outcome. This moment was always inevitable barring a miracle, but it comes at a time when he still has a lot of the spotlight and supporter energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know Yang can do right now? Save goddamn America, that’s what he can do right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Sarfraz is like a super fan of Bruce’s. He’s seen him 150 times, so much so that Bruce recognizes him at concerts, because he’s probably the only Pakistani in the audience, and he’s got a big afro. When Sarfraz wrote his book and gave it to me, I said I know how to make this film, but we have to get Bruce on our side.\n\nIn 2010, Bruce was attending the premiere of his film “The Promise” in London. I was invited. I took Sarfraz as my plus one. We stood on the red carpet, hoping to take photographs with him. As he walked down, he banana-ed and walked over to Sarfraz and said, “Man, I read your book! It’s really beautiful.” Sarfraz started hyperventilating. And then I ran over and sort of seized the moment and said, “Hi Bruce! My name is Gurinda. I’m a film director. We really want to make a film of the book.” He looked at Sarfraz and me and said, “Sounds good. Talk to Jon Landau \\[his manager\\].”\n\nWe knew from that moment, once we had that nod from Bruce, we had to write a script he had to love. Bruce’s words are as much part of the narrative as our own dialogue. We sent it to him, and waited and waited and waited. The message we got back is: “I’m all good with this. Give them what they want.” Our timing was great because he really has been looking at legacy and the impact of his work and what that means for him at his age.",

The Boston Globe estimated that the project will ultimately cost $22 billion, including interest, and that it would not be paid off until 2038. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The Church Committee led to the founding of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).

(It&amp;#39;s why Osama bin Laden was not assassinated in the 90s, though after 9/11 this prohibition was brought under scrutiny.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/27/in-the-1970s-congress-investigated-intelligence-abuses-time-to-do-it-again/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.26d7fc0d329a\"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/27/in-the-1970s-congress-investigated-intelligence-abuses-time-to-do-it-again/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.26d7fc0d329a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[T]he purpose of the Church committee was to make sure the intelligence community understood that it was part of the U.S. government, that it wasn&amp;#39;t some special entity that didn&amp;#39;t require regulation or oversight. In a way, the CIA and other agencies were brought into the framework of checks and balances. The Church Committee led to the founding of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). That made oversight as different as night and day. Before, very few hearings and minimal oversight. After the Church Committee, you had two robust committees with sizable staffs of lawyers and others. It really was a dramatic change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "&gt; CIA just ended up giving us a pseudo-communist infestation.\n\nThis isn't a fact at all. It's commonly understood by historians that the US Communist Party, which was influential in left/labor politics in the first part of the 20th century, was controlled by the Soviets and advocated for Stalin's policies under direct Kremlin orders, including support for Stalin's non-aggression pact with Hitler. The Soviets were also behind the \"CIA killed JFK\" disinformation conspiracy theory that is still believed by many Americans to this day.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/opinion/communist-party-usa-soviet-union.html\n\nAt certain times, this Soviet domination was blatant. In both 1929 and 1945, Moscow demanded, and got, a change of party leadership. Jay Lovestone had the support of 90 percent of the party members in 1929, but his support for the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin led Stalin to remove Lovestone as the American party’s general secretary. When, at a hearing chaired by Stalin himself, Lovestone and several of his lieutenants refused to back down, Stalin angrily denounced them and turned the C.P.U.S.A. over to its factional opponents. When the Lovestoneites set up a dissident movement, fewer than 200 American Communists joined.\n\nLater, Lovestone’s Stalin-approved successor, Earl Browder, concluded that the American-Soviet alliance of World War II would continue after the defeat of Nazi Germany. For this reason, in 1944, he boldly engineered the transformation of the C.P.U.S.A. into a pressure group designed to work within the Democratic Party. When Browder refused to accept Soviet criticism of his policies the following year, he, too, was unceremoniously removed — expelled from the party for his heresy.\n\nRunning for president in 1936, Browder offered indirect support to Roosevelt. Two years later, Communists — who had formerly regarded Roosevelt as a harbinger of American fascism — hailed the president for his calls for a democratic alliance against Hitler.\n\nThe hosannas for antifascism ended suddenly in 1939 with the Nazi-Soviet Pact. The same Communists who had lauded Roosevelt now denounced him again, this time as a warmonger for such policies as Lend-Lease aid to Britain. The somersaults demanded by Moscow continued when Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941: The C.P.U.S.A.’s calls for peace were quickly replaced by demands that the United States do everything possible to aid the Allies.\n\nThe C.P.U.S.A. dutifully spread the lies put out by Moscow. The party thus insisted that the show trials during Stalin’s purges had uncovered a vast capitalist plot against the Soviet leader. Party members dutifully repeated Soviet fabrications that Trotsky had been in the pay of the Nazis. Worst of all, many Communists applauded the execution of tens of thousands of Soviet comrades, denouncing those who were executed as bourgeois spies and provocateurs. When Finnish-Americans who had returned to Soviet Karelia in the late 1920s and early ’30s to build socialism were purged, their American relatives were warned by party authorities to remain silent, and most did so.\n\nNeither did the Communist movement limit its disinformation to Russian matters. In the 1960s, the K.G.B. secretly subsidized a left-wing publishing house in New York run by a former party member, Carl Marzani, that published the first book claiming that John F. Kennedy’s assassination had been arranged by a cabal of American right-wing businessmen and C.I.A. operatives.",

It&amp;#39;s commonly understood by historians that the US Communist Party, which was influential in left/labor politics in the first part of the 20th century, was controlled by the Soviets and advocated for Stalin&amp;#39;s policies under direct Kremlin orders, including support for Stalin&amp;#39;s non-aggression pact with Hitler. The Soviets were also behind the &amp;quot;CIA killed JFK&amp;quot; disinformation conspiracy theory that is still believed by many Americans to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/opinion/communist-party-usa-soviet-union.html\"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/opinion/communist-party-usa-soviet-union.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At certain times, this Soviet domination was blatant. In both 1929 and 1945, Moscow demanded, and got, a change of party leadership. Jay Lovestone had the support of 90 percent of the party members in 1929, but his support for the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin led Stalin to remove Lovestone as the American party’s general secretary. When, at a hearing chaired by Stalin himself, Lovestone and several of his lieutenants refused to back down, Stalin angrily denounced them and turned the C.P.U.S.A. over to its factional opponents. When the Lovestoneites set up a dissident movement, fewer than 200 American Communists joined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, Lovestone’s Stalin-approved successor, Earl Browder, concluded that the American-Soviet alliance of World War II would continue after the defeat of Nazi Germany. For this reason, in 1944, he boldly engineered the transformation of the C.P.U.S.A. into a pressure group designed to work within the Democratic Party. When Browder refused to accept Soviet criticism of his policies the following year, he, too, was unceremoniously removed — expelled from the party for his heresy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running for president in 1936, Browder offered indirect support to Roosevelt. Two years later, Communists — who had formerly regarded Roosevelt as a harbinger of American fascism — hailed the president for his calls for a democratic alliance against Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hosannas for antifascism ended suddenly in 1939 with the Nazi-Soviet Pact. The same Communists who had lauded Roosevelt now denounced him again, this time as a warmonger for such policies as Lend-Lease aid to Britain. The somersaults demanded by Moscow continued when Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941: The C.P.U.S.A.’s calls for peace were quickly replaced by demands that the United States do everything possible to aid the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The C.P.U.S.A. dutifully spread the lies put out by Moscow. The party thus insisted that the show trials during Stalin’s purges had uncovered a vast capitalist plot against the Soviet leader. Party members dutifully repeated Soviet fabrications that Trotsky had been in the pay of the Nazis. Worst of all, many Communists applauded the execution of tens of thousands of Soviet comrades, denouncing those who were executed as bourgeois spies and provocateurs. When Finnish-Americans who had returned to Soviet Karelia in the late 1920s and early ’30s to build socialism were purged, their American relatives were warned by party authorities to remain silent, and most did so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither did the Communist movement limit its disinformation to Russian matters. In the 1960s, the K.G.B. secretly subsidized a left-wing publishing house in New York run by a former party member, Carl Marzani, that published the first book claiming that John F. Kennedy’s assassination had been arranged by a cabal of American right-wing businessmen and C.I.A. operatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Bush should be criticized for cherry picking the evidence to imply the danger was imminent, and then fucking up the rebuilding of Iraq so badly the Sunni/Baathist insurgency and then Daesh were able to take root, which contributed to the most loss of life. But that's a different topic. We now know Saddam was intentionally bluffing about his WMD program to make Iran (mostly) believe he still had an active stockpile, when he didn't -- i.e. the intelligence community bought the bluff.\n\n*60 Minutes* interview with Saddam's interrogator:\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/interrogator-shares-saddams-confessions/4/\n\nThat June 2000 speech was about weapons of mass destruction. In talking casually about that speech, Saddam began to tell the story of his weapons. It was a breakthrough that had taken five months.\n\"Oh, you couldn't imagine the excitement that I was feeling at that point,\" Piro remembers.\n\n\"And what did he tell you about how his weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed?\" Pelley asks.\n\n\"He told me that most of the WMD had been destroyed by the U.N. inspectors in the '90s. And those that hadn't been destroyed by the inspectors were unilaterally destroyed by Iraq,\" Piro says.\n\n\"So why keep the secret? Why put your nation at risk, why put your own life at risk to maintain this charade?\" Pelley asks.\n\n\"It was very important for him to project that because that was what kept him, in his mind, in power. That capability kept the Iranians away. It kept them from reinvading Iraq,\" Piro says.\n\nBefore his wars with America, Saddam had fought a ruinous eight year war with Iran and it was Iran he still feared the most.\n\n\"He believed that he couldn't survive without the perception that he had weapons of mass destruction?\" Pelley asks.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Piro says.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller wasn&amp;#39;t lying or repeating Bush propaganda. Before the invasion, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; intelligence agency in NATO believed Saddam had an active WMD program and/or stockpile of some kind. Bush should be criticized for cherry picking the evidence to imply the danger was imminent, and then fucking up the rebuilding of Iraq so badly the Sunni/Baathist insurgency and then Daesh were able to take root, which contributed to the most loss of life. But that&amp;#39;s a different topic. We now know Saddam was intentionally bluffing about his WMD program to make Iran (mostly) believe he still had an active stockpile, when he didn&amp;#39;t -- i.e. the intelligence community bought the bluff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; interview with Saddam&amp;#39;s interrogator:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interrogator-shares-saddams-confessions/4/\"&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interrogator-shares-saddams-confessions/4/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That June 2000 speech was about weapons of mass destruction. In talking casually about that speech, Saddam began to tell the story of his weapons. It was a breakthrough that had taken five months.\n&amp;quot;Oh, you couldn&amp;#39;t imagine the excitement that I was feeling at that point,&amp;quot; Piro remembers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what did he tell you about how his weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed?&amp;quot; Pelley asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He told me that most of the WMD had been destroyed by the U.N. inspectors in the &amp;#39;90s. And those that hadn&amp;#39;t been destroyed by the inspectors were unilaterally destroyed by Iraq,&amp;quot; Piro says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So why keep the secret? Why put your nation at risk, why put your own life at risk to maintain this charade?&amp;quot; Pelley asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was very important for him to project that because that was what kept him, in his mind, in power. That capability kept the Iranians away. It kept them from reinvading Iraq,&amp;quot; Piro says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before his wars with America, Saddam had fought a ruinous eight year war with Iran and it was Iran he still feared the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He believed that he couldn&amp;#39;t survive without the perception that he had weapons of mass destruction?&amp;quot; Pelley asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Absolutely,&amp;quot; Piro says.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
