Some professors are finding they enjoy teaching online, or that it works well with some courses. At one university, for example, this experience has really encouraged faculty to support a proposed online master's program for current MS and HS teachers of biology. But many professors still believe in the superiority of F2F experience for courses that could ostensibly be online, as do many students. And of course there are arts and lab science courses that will remain very challenging to teach and learn online, such as -- no joke -- ice carving: [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/14/teaching-lab-sciences-and-fine-arts-during-covid-19](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insidehighered.com%2Fnews%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fteaching-lab-sciences-and-fine-arts-during-covid-19)\n\n\\- Colleen\n\nIf remote instruction continues, many institutions will be offering fully online programs by proxy in the fall. We have already seen students asking for discounts or refunds because they wanted a campus experience and not remote instruction. I think most institutions will try to keep tuition at the current level and employ the same instructors to teach as before.\n\n  \nWe may see a surge in institutions talking about launching new fully online programs, but it would be some time before we start to see a meaningful increase in programs being launched. Historically online degrees have taken months if not years to develop and require a lot of cash. Working with a revenue-share online program management company may be an option for institutions seeking up-front investment, but with uncertain enrollment projections, these companies may be limited in how many new programs they can launch.\n\n\\- Lindsay\n\n(Edited to add another response)",

At one university, for example, this experience has really encouraged faculty to support a proposed online master&amp;#39;s program for current MS and HS teachers of biology. But many professors still believe in the superiority of F2F experience for courses that could ostensibly be online, as do many students. And of course there are arts and lab science courses that will remain very challenging to teach and learn online, such as -- no joke -- ice carving: &lt;a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insidehighered.com%2Fnews%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fteaching-lab-sciences-and-fine-arts-during-covid-19\"&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/14/teaching-lab-sciences-and-fine-arts-during-covid-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Colleen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If remote instruction continues, many institutions will be offering fully online programs by proxy in the fall. We have already seen students asking for discounts or refunds because they wanted a campus experience and not remote instruction. I think most institutions will try to keep tuition at the current level and employ the same instructors to teach as before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We may see a surge in institutions talking about launching new fully online programs, but it would be some time before we start to see a meaningful increase in programs being launched. Historically online degrees have taken months if not years to develop and require a lot of cash. Working with a revenue-share online program management company may be an option for institutions seeking up-front investment, but with uncertain enrollment projections, these companies may be limited in how many new programs they can launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lindsay&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Edited to add another response)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
