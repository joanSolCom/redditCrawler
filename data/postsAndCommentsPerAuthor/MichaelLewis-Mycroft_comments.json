With focus and time, it&amp;#39;ll get done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we get the core software in shape, we&amp;#39;ll focus on the installation experience. Then, and only then, we will be ready for end-users to try it and we&amp;#39;ll have a roll out much like we did for the games I worked on: alpha, beta, and production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, if you&amp;#39;re interested in using Mycroft on your desktop or just for Skill development, you might try the &lt;a href=\"https://Snapcraft.io/mycroft\"&gt;Snapcraft.io/mycroft&lt;/a&gt; installation. It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; in alpha, but bugs in that will likely get more attention than repo clones.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
