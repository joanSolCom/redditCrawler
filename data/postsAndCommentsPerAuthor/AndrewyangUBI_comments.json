Can you imagine their offices and phone lines?  Plus we don&amp;#39;t need 65% of Congress, we just need a majority.  Cash is hard to demonize.  The Freedom Dividend will be very hard to stop after I win.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We would need to not just curtail our emissions rapidly, we would also need to export clean energy technology to developing countries as fast as possible and get their emissions down.  In China, they're taking their dirty power plants and shipping them to Africa and countries that are earlier in the development chain.  \n\nThe reality is that for any developing country, they will be most interested in the most cost effective way to get as much energy as possible.  We would need to dramatically improve the appeal of solar/wind/hydroelectric energy to make them a viable choice in many environments.  And yes, this includes nuclear energy, which has come a long way and in my opinion needs to be part of the solution.  Ideally, the US becomes a massive exporter of these solutions, possibly subsidized to make them more appealing.  \n\nI'm for rejoining the Paris Accords obviously and implementing a carbon fee and dividend that should rise over time.  Investing hundreds of billions in an upgraded infrastructure would also help.  \n\nThe difficulty of dramatically reversing the rise in global emissions is one reason why I am so passionate about other ways we can mitigate the effects of climate change.  We should plant hundreds of thousands of trees as fast as possible.  We should study seeding oceans.  We should even research what it would take to lower the temperature of the Earth in various ways, including aerosols.  Scientists in various countries are already studying and working on this - I would organize conferences and resources to formalize the research in this area.  \n\nIt's going to get rough in the years to come, unfortunately.  But there is a lot we can do that would help.",

In China, they&amp;#39;re taking their dirty power plants and shipping them to Africa and countries that are earlier in the development chain.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is that for any developing country, they will be most interested in the most cost effective way to get as much energy as possible.  We would need to dramatically improve the appeal of solar/wind/hydroelectric energy to make them a viable choice in many environments.  And yes, this includes nuclear energy, which has come a long way and in my opinion needs to be part of the solution.  Ideally, the US becomes a massive exporter of these solutions, possibly subsidized to make them more appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m for rejoining the Paris Accords obviously and implementing a carbon fee and dividend that should rise over time.  Investing hundreds of billions in an upgraded infrastructure would also help.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of dramatically reversing the rise in global emissions is one reason why I am so passionate about other ways we can mitigate the effects of climate change.  We should plant hundreds of thousands of trees as fast as possible.  We should study seeding oceans.  We should even research what it would take to lower the temperature of the Earth in various ways, including aerosols.  Scientists in various countries are already studying and working on this - I would organize conferences and resources to formalize the research in this area.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s going to get rough in the years to come, unfortunately.  But there is a lot we can do that would help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I owe him a lot.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freakonomics - Stephen Dubner does great work and I didn&amp;#39;t know where the story was going to go.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breakfast Club - Sitting down with them felt very human.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And my interview with Joe Rogan felt like I had a great opportunity to share a lot of the most important ideas of the campaign with a lot of like-minded people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have adapted to certain things over time, particularly the rhythm of TV media appearances.  But generally the longer the convo the more likely I am to enjoy it.  Not because I like to hear myself talk but more because I feel like I can convey the most important ideas in a more effective way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

A friend of mine in the investment space says that she has never seen profiteering at the level she currently sees among device and drug companies.  Similarly, we have a massive private health insurance industry - who put up strong profits each year.  Right now our system is built to drive revenue and receivables.  \n\nThe confusion on Medicare for All is that we are already spending the money - it is just coming from businesses and consumers.  If, as the CEO of a company, the government came to me and said, \"Hey, great news.  We now will pick up everyone's healthcare.  But you need to give us a lot of the money you are currently spending on their health insurance\" I would have been thrilled.  Because it's not just the money out of the business.  It's the fact that costs always go up every single year AND you have to have uncomfortable conversations and negotiations every year with employees.  \n\nI am driven too by the experience in the Cleveland Clinic - when doctors are paid independent of the procedures they perform or tests they order, they decide fewer procedures and tests are necessary.  \n\nThere is plenty of money in the system.  It's just being driven to a lot of things that aren't actually improving our health outcomes.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the national debt side, I am concerned.  I treat it as a business - we have a revenue problem and an expense problem.  On the revenue side we need a mechanism to capture the gains from technological advances - like my VAT proposal.  With that our revenue could go up immensely in the years to come.  On the cost side we are spending $750 billion on military spending that could be channeled in more productive ways.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a window of opportunity to make big moves - we are still the global reserve currency.  We need to take advantage of this opportunity to remedy the imbalances in ways that serve us.",

Similarly, we have a massive private health insurance industry - who put up strong profits each year.  Right now our system is built to drive revenue and receivables.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The confusion on Medicare for All is that we are already spending the money - it is just coming from businesses and consumers.  If, as the CEO of a company, the government came to me and said, &amp;quot;Hey, great news.  We now will pick up everyone&amp;#39;s healthcare.  But you need to give us a lot of the money you are currently spending on their health insurance&amp;quot; I would have been thrilled.  Because it&amp;#39;s not just the money out of the business.  It&amp;#39;s the fact that costs always go up every single year AND you have to have uncomfortable conversations and negotiations every year with employees.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am driven too by the experience in the Cleveland Clinic - when doctors are paid independent of the procedures they perform or tests they order, they decide fewer procedures and tests are necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of money in the system.  It&amp;#39;s just being driven to a lot of things that aren&amp;#39;t actually improving our health outcomes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the national debt side, I am concerned.  I treat it as a business - we have a revenue problem and an expense problem.  On the revenue side we need a mechanism to capture the gains from technological advances - like my VAT proposal.  With that our revenue could go up immensely in the years to come.  On the cost side we are spending $750 billion on military spending that could be channeled in more productive ways.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a window of opportunity to make big moves - we are still the global reserve currency.  We need to take advantage of this opportunity to remedy the imbalances in ways that serve us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We have squandered trillions of dollars and thousands of lives - both American and foreign - on interventions that may not have achieved their original goals.  Accordingly, my foreign policy thinking revolves around restraint and judgment, and rebuilding our alliances and partnerships.  In my view, our foreign policy reflects our strength at home.  We are falling apart at home.  Hence, our allies now see us as erratic and unreliable because we vacillate on various commitments.  We need to become more whole at home to be able to project a steady, reliable foreign policy over a sustained period of time.  If I commit our armed forces into harm's way, they will know that they are serving America's vital national interests, we have a clear goal that they can accomplish in a reasonable time frame, they will have the right equipment and resources, and they will be treated with appropriate gratitude and support when they return home.  \n2. America will remain either the most important country in the world or one of the most important countries in the world for decades to come.  The big error to avoid would be to think about countries' relative trajectories as zero sum.  That is, if China or India becomes more economically advanced and powerful, it will somehow be detrimental to America's interests.  If America becomes comfortable with other rising powers, its stature in the next 30 years will be quite secure.  \n3. The U.S. - China relationship is of massive importance.  It is impossible to address climate change, AI development, North Korea and other major issues without Sino-American collaboration.  Here too, I think that zero sum thinking must be avoided.  I would make this relationship a chief priority.  I thought the trade war was an extremely aggressive move.  Yes, China has abused the relationship particularly around appropriation of American intellectual property.  But there are better ways to approach improvements than punishing workers and businesses on both sides.  Big picture, avoiding a new Cold War with China is paramount.  America has a tendency to think that we can do something - like tampering with elections or gathering intelligence - but if someone else does it it's unacceptable.

These companies wouldn't dream of gouging consumers - they do the opposite.  They underprice items to a point that other firms can't compete.  This is one reason why 30% of malls and Main Street stores are closing in the next 5 years - Amazon is soaking up $20 billion in additional business annually by making things cheaper and cheaper.  \n\nIf a regulator were to come look at Amazon they would say, \"Not overcharging customers!\" and walk away.  This worked in the past but doesn't work today.  \n\nAs a result, we need a new anti-trust regime.  \n\nTo be clear, I am cautious on this front because it's not the case that if we were to split Amazon up into 4 mini-Amazons it would somehow resuscitate main street retail around the country.  Things are not that simple.  \n\nBut I am excited to sit down with the right people and determine what the new anti-trust standards should be.  The biggest companies have run amok.  We have to come up with new standards for the 21st century economy as fast as possible.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This is one reason why 30% of malls and Main Street stores are closing in the next 5 years - Amazon is soaking up $20 billion in additional business annually by making things cheaper and cheaper.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a regulator were to come look at Amazon they would say, &amp;quot;Not overcharging customers!&amp;quot; and walk away.  This worked in the past but doesn&amp;#39;t work today.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, we need a new anti-trust regime.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I am cautious on this front because it&amp;#39;s not the case that if we were to split Amazon up into 4 mini-Amazons it would somehow resuscitate main street retail around the country.  Things are not that simple.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I am excited to sit down with the right people and determine what the new anti-trust standards should be.  The biggest companies have run amok.  We have to come up with new standards for the 21st century economy as fast as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It is scarce.  2.  If we all had more of it, it would lose value.  3.  It corresponds to your value as a human being.  \n\nThere is thus a natural knee-jerk reaction that all of us getting money would undermine the economy and reduce buying power.  \n\nThe truth is that our economy is up to $20 trillion – up $5 trillion in the last 12 years alone – and the amount of money $1,000 a month per adult would inject into the economy would not drive meaningful inflation based upon changes in the money supply.  For example, the government printed $4 trillion for the banks in the financial crisis to no meaningful inflation.  \n\nIf you look at your own experience, most things have not been getting expensive for you over the past number of years or have been improving for a similar cost:  Clothing, electronics, media, cars, food, etc.  Technology and improving supply chains tend to reduce prices or improve quality over time for most things.  \n\nThere are 3 exceptions to this that are causing most of the painful inflation in America:  1.  Housing 2.  Education  3. Healthcare \n\nEach of these is highly inefficient for various reasons.  Housing is because people feel a need to live in certain places - for work generally - and because zoning regulations and financial incentives reward high-end housing and not affordable housing.  Education is because college has gotten 250% more expensive in the last 25 years and families feel they have no choice but to borrow huge loans and pay.  Health care because of opaque pricing and an intermediary private insurance system that rewards revenue-generating activity and passes along costs to the public or an employer.  \n\nOutside of these areas, prices have been and would continue to be quite stable.  For example, let’s say I’m President in 2021 and everyone is getting a $1,000 a month dividend, including you.  You’re feeling good.  You walk into your local burger joint only to find that the price of a burger has gone up from $5 to $10.  Would you be cool with that?  Of course not.  You would still be cost-sensitive.  And the burger joint has to compete with every other restaurant in town.  All it takes is for one restaurant to keep its prices more or less the same and then all of them will too – while getting more business because you and your neighbors have more money to spend.  This applies across every category.  \n\nIf a landlord decided to gouge you (after your lease was up, if you don’t have an agreed-upon percentage change for the following year), you would look for another place to live. You might have more flexibility because the dividend is portable and doesn’t depend on your proximity to work, your friends are also getting a dividend so you could decide to throw in together on a house, etc.  The dividend would actually increase your ability to make effective changes.  \n\nI have separate plans to try and reduce housing, education and healthcare costs that you can check out on my website.  Those are the core causes of inflation in the U.S., NOT the buying power of our citizens.  Putting money in our hands will not increase that pressure on us – it will decrease it greatly and increase our purchasing power to address those areas where inflation does exist.  \n\nIf this was too drawn out – I have an Economics degree, and there is no reason to believe that a Universal Basic Income would create rampant inflation.  :)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "body": "**1.** Given that experts have recommended [paper ballots](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=25120) as the most secure form of voting, and arguments that [electronic voting is always a bad idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI), **what evidence has lead you to support online voting as a secure election method?**\n\nAY - Right now it would not be a secure method.  I agree that paper ballots are currently the most secure, and even during the transition you would want to have paper ballots as a backup. I believe in the vision of online voting but would not rely upon it 100% until the tech is ready for primetime.  \n\n**2.** Blockchain technology seems to be key to your voting proposal, and I've seen my fair share of justified skepticism surrounding this concept to cast doubts around its effectiveness in solving this problem. **How could a blockchain be implemented in a way that could solve any concerns with electronic election fraud or interference?**\n\nAY - The potential of blockchain is vast.  Theoretically a public ledger could allow for us to be 100% secure that our votes are cast without fraud or interference.  The tech is not there yet for nation-scale elections but it could be in time.  That is the goal.  \n\n**3.** Convenience of online voting seems to be a driving factor in your support of these changes, but voting from anywhere with no physical trail seems to open massive opportunity for foreign interference in our elections, which is a concern for many after 2016. **How exactly would your mobile device voting be verified to only come from US citizens?**\n\nAY - There would be a registration process analogous to what is currently done where one can verify one’s citizenship and address.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Given that experts have recommended &lt;a href=\"http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=25120\"&gt;paper ballots&lt;/a&gt; as the most secure form of voting, and arguments that &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI\"&gt;electronic voting is always a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;what evidence has lead you to support online voting as a secure election method?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AY - Right now it would not be a secure method.  I agree that paper ballots are currently the most secure, and even during the transition you would want to have paper ballots as a backup. I believe in the vision of online voting but would not rely upon it 100% until the tech is ready for primetime.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Blockchain technology seems to be key to your voting proposal, and I&amp;#39;ve seen my fair share of justified skepticism surrounding this concept to cast doubts around its effectiveness in solving this problem. &lt;strong&gt;How could a blockchain be implemented in a way that could solve any concerns with electronic election fraud or interference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AY - The potential of blockchain is vast.  Theoretically a public ledger could allow for us to be 100% secure that our votes are cast without fraud or interference.  The tech is not there yet for nation-scale elections but it could be in time.  That is the goal.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Convenience of online voting seems to be a driving factor in your support of these changes, but voting from anywhere with no physical trail seems to open massive opportunity for foreign interference in our elections, which is a concern for many after 2016. &lt;strong&gt;How exactly would your mobile device voting be verified to only come from US citizens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AY - There would be a registration process analogous to what is currently done where one can verify one’s citizenship and address.  We have public records of most voters and verifying citizenship would be straightforward.  With the proper safeguards in place, it wouldn’t be possible to have a foreign power interfere without our knowing about it – if the tech is ready.

We have squandered trillions of dollars and thousands of lives - both American and foreign - on interventions that may not have achieved their original goals.  Accordingly, my foreign policy thinking revolves around restraint and judgment, and rebuilding our alliances and partnerships.  In my view, our foreign policy reflects our strength at home.  We are falling apart at home.  Hence, our allies now see us as erratic and unreliable because we vacillate on various commitments.  We need to become more whole at home to be able to project a steady, reliable foreign policy over a sustained period of time.  If I commit our armed forces into harm's way, they will know that they are serving America's vital national interests, we have a clear goal that they can accomplish in a reasonable time frame, they will have the right equipment and resources, and they will be treated with appropriate gratitude and support when they return home.  \n2. America will remain either the most important country in the world or one of the most important countries in the world for decades to come.  The big error to avoid would be to think about countries' relative trajectories as zero sum.  That is, if China or India becomes more economically advanced and powerful, it will somehow be detrimental to America's interests.  If America becomes comfortable with other rising powers, its stature in the next 30 years will be quite secure.  \n3. The U.S. - China relationship is of massive importance.  It is impossible to address climate change, AI development, North Korea and other major issues without Sino-American collaboration.  Here too, I think that zero sum thinking must be avoided.  I would make this relationship a chief priority.  I thought the trade war was an extremely aggressive move.  Yes, China has abused the relationship particularly around appropriation of American intellectual property.  But there are better ways to approach improvements than punishing workers and businesses on both sides.  Big picture, avoiding a new Cold War with China is paramount.  America has a tendency to think that we can do something - like tampering with elections or gathering intelligence - but if someone else does it it's unacceptable.  We need to change that approach and maintain a strong relationship with the second-biggest economy in the world if at all possible.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

At this point, corporate lobbyists have overrun our government and run rings around the American people.  I believe someone looked into it and found that the return on investment for lobbying expenses for companies was something like $20 for every $1 spent.  Lobbying pays.  \n\nI have a few big moves in mind to combat this.  \n\nFirst, every major regulator would get a significant pay raise, to something like $1 million  a year.  BUT they would be banned from working for industry for life.  This way, they would have pure incentives to truly look out for the public and not worry about having to curry favor with companies down the road.  \n\nSecond, I would put $100 worth of \"Democracy Dollars\" into the hands of the American people each year that can only be contributed to political candidates.  This would wash out the influence of corporate Super PAC money by making political leaders more responsive to the American people.  By the numbers, the amount of money in the hands of the public would outweigh all of the money spent by corporate lobbyists significantly assuming even a minority of citizens used the Democracy Dollars each year.  \n\nThird, I would personally agree not to take a dime from any company for my private benefit after leaving office.  If you're going to change the culture, you have to start at the top.  It's human nature to be nice to powerful, influential people, and this temptation is particularly strong if they can wave money at you afterwards.  I'm a simple person who doesn't need a goddamn jet.  We have to stop worshipping the almighty dollar.  \n\nThere are other things we could do but this is where I'd start.  ",

Lobbying pays.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a few big moves in mind to combat this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, every major regulator would get a significant pay raise, to something like $1 million  a year.  BUT they would be banned from working for industry for life.  This way, they would have pure incentives to truly look out for the public and not worry about having to curry favor with companies down the road.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I would put $100 worth of &amp;quot;Democracy Dollars&amp;quot; into the hands of the American people each year that can only be contributed to political candidates.  This would wash out the influence of corporate Super PAC money by making political leaders more responsive to the American people.  By the numbers, the amount of money in the hands of the public would outweigh all of the money spent by corporate lobbyists significantly assuming even a minority of citizens used the Democracy Dollars each year.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, I would personally agree not to take a dime from any company for my private benefit after leaving office.  If you&amp;#39;re going to change the culture, you have to start at the top.  It&amp;#39;s human nature to be nice to powerful, influential people, and this temptation is particularly strong if they can wave money at you afterwards.  I&amp;#39;m a simple person who doesn&amp;#39;t need a goddamn jet.  We have to stop worshipping the almighty dollar.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are other things we could do but this is where I&amp;#39;d start.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It is scarce.  2.  If we all had more of it, it would lose value.  3.  It corresponds to your value as a human being.  \n\nThere is thus a natural knee-jerk reaction that all of us getting money would undermine the economy and reduce buying power.  \n\nThe truth is that our economy is up to $20 trillion – up $5 trillion in the last 12 years alone – and the amount of money $1,000 a month per adult would inject into the economy would not drive meaningful inflation based upon changes in the money supply.  For example, the government printed $4 trillion for the banks in the financial crisis to no meaningful inflation.  \n\nIf you look at your own experience, most things have not been getting expensive for you over the past number of years or have been improving for a similar cost:  Clothing, electronics, media, cars, food, etc.  Technology and improving supply chains tend to reduce prices or improve quality over time for most things.  \n\nThere are 3 exceptions to this that are causing most of the painful inflation in America:  1.  Housing 2.  Education  3. Healthcare \n\nEach of these is highly inefficient for various reasons.  Housing is because people feel a need to live in certain places - for work generally - and because zoning regulations and financial incentives reward high-end housing and not affordable housing.  Education is because college has gotten 250% more expensive in the last 25 years and families feel they have no choice but to borrow huge loans and pay.  Health care because of opaque pricing and an intermediary private insurance system that rewards revenue-generating activity and passes along costs to the public or an employer.  \n\nOutside of these areas, prices have been and would continue to be quite stable.  For example, let’s say I’m President in 2021 and everyone is getting a $1,000 a month dividend, including you.  You’re feeling good.  You walk into your local burger joint only to find that the price of a burger has gone up from $5 to $10.  Would you be cool with that?  Of course not.  You would still be cost-sensitive.  And the burger joint has to compete with every other restaurant in town.  All it takes is for one restaurant to keep its prices more or less the same and then all of them will too – while getting more business because you and your neighbors have more money to spend.  This applies across every category.  \n\nIf a landlord decided to gouge you (after your lease was up, if you don’t have an agreed-upon percentage change for the following year), you would look for another place to live. You might have more flexibility because the dividend is portable and doesn’t depend on your proximity to work, your friends are also getting a dividend so you could decide to throw in together on a house, etc.  The dividend would actually increase your ability to make effective changes.  \n\nI have separate plans to try and reduce housing, education and healthcare costs that you can check out on my website.  Those are the core causes of inflation in the U.S., NOT the buying power of our citizens.  Putting money in our hands will not increase that pressure on us – it will decrease it greatly and increase our purchasing power to address those areas where inflation does exist.  \n\nIf this was too drawn out – I have an Economics degree, and there is no reason to believe that a Universal Basic Income would create rampant inflation.  :)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I agree that paper ballots are currently the most secure, and even during the transition you would want to have paper ballots as a backup. I believe in the vision of online voting but would not rely upon it 100% until the tech is ready for primetime.  \n\n**2.** Blockchain technology seems to be key to your voting proposal, and I've seen my fair share of justified skepticism surrounding this concept to cast doubts around its effectiveness in solving this problem. **How could a blockchain be implemented in a way that could solve any concerns with electronic election fraud or interference?**\n\nAY - The potential of blockchain is vast.  Theoretically a public ledger could allow for us to be 100% secure that our votes are cast without fraud or interference.  The tech is not there yet for nation-scale elections but it could be in time.  That is the goal.  \n\n**3.** Convenience of online voting seems to be a driving factor in your support of these changes, but voting from anywhere with no physical trail seems to open massive opportunity for foreign interference in our elections, which is a concern for many after 2016. **How exactly would your mobile device voting be verified to only come from US citizens?**\n\nAY - There would be a registration process analogous to what is currently done where one can verify one’s citizenship and address.  We have public records of most voters and verifying citizenship would be straightforward.

Again, it’s something we need to move toward to achieve a more powerful, flexible and genuine democracy. \n\n**4.** *Bonus question also about voting:* Do you support alternatives to first-past-the-post voting (such as ranked-choice voting, instant-runoff, or single transferable vote, among others), which would fix many issues in our democracy (like being stuck in a 2-party system, a natural result of FPTP voting)? **How would you work to get superior alternative voting systems implemented around the nation?**\n\nAY - I am for ranked-choice voting – our current first-past-the-post system tends to help incumbents and discourage voters from ‘wasting their vote’ even if a certain candidate is their true preference.  Some have suggested that Trump would not have won the Republican nomination last time with a ranked-choice system as other candidates could have built more support as the 2nd and 3rd choice of many others. The process matters.  I would champion ranked-choice voting as President. It would improve our democracy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the questions!  - Andrew",
