This ripples through generations: research finds children with incarcerated parents more likely to themselves be incarcerated. The justice system fails to reintegrate the 650,000 individuals it releases each year, yet **reducing recidivism is an essential step to decarceration**. Our communications tools are reconnecting incarcerated people with the support of their families and friends, as well as with reentry organizations working to support their re-integration. **By** **connecting individuals with a strong network of support, we will reduce recidivism** and decarcerate the U.S.  \n \n2. **Ending the commercialization of incarceration:** The coupling of incarceration and profit is at the core of the prison industrial complex. **So long as profit margins and prison populations expand in tandem, there are financial incentives to incarcerate more people.** To end mass incarceration, we need to eliminate these financial incentives. To us, prison telecoms is the most obvious place to begin:  \n  \n   1. Prison telecoms providers are some of the most wildly exploitative players in the criminal justice space: their **$1.2bn industry and 50% profit margins** ([https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2015/06/19/securus-profits/](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2015/06/19/securus-profits/)) are built on the backs of incarcerated people and their loved ones.\n   2. As a **duopoly** with enormous market share ([https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/state\\_of\\_phone\\_justice.html](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/phones/state_of_phone_justice.html)), their predatory practices are harming **millions of Americans.**\n   3. So, undercutting the for-profit industry is central to our mission. It's why we're the **only nonprofit prison telecoms provider in the country.**  \n \n\nTo your broader point of complicity with correctional facilities: our belief is that **policy takes time.** It'll be years, if not decades, before the size of U.S. prison populations are drastically reduced. In the meantime, **millions of families are suffering the harms of mass incarceration**. It's urgent that we do all we can to alleviate some of the pain inflicted on incarcerated individuals, families, and communities. Especially when **these efforts advance, rather than delay, efforts to decarcerate &amp; decommercialize the justice system.**",

I'm going to answer your question by identifying why facilities currently support us and then highlight some ways we want to win skeptics over. \n\nCurrently, we already see strong support in facilities like the following: \n\n1.) Those with strong political support -- social and political trends in more progressive areas have encouraged elected Sheriffs, DAs, local and county officials, and state leaders, to look for innovative solutions like Ameelio. \n\n2.) Those that are underserved by the existing duopoly -- duopolies work best in areas that can achieve economies of scale, so large state correctional systems and dense areas. This leaves rural communities, where people are incarcerated much further away from their homes and loved ones, without an existing service. \n\nThe two groups outlined above are already pretty substantial. While the existing duopoly has a strong presence, do not mistake the ubiquity of service with satisfaction. In fact, because there is almost no competition, the duopoly has failed to meet the needs of incarcerated people, their families, and correctional administrators. \n\nHighlighting ways we want to win administrators over: \n\n1.)  Reduced recidivism -- a key thesis of our organization is that the existing duopoly increases the likelihood of recidivism because it prevents contact with loved ones and re-entry services. Correctional administrators, more than ever, are faced with mandates to cut costs, and that often means reducing recidivism. Connecting incarcerated people with the free world is not only morally right, but it is fiscally responsible.\n\n2.) Organizing political support -- the duopoly is most entrenched in areas where kickbacks and commissions received by correctional administrators support a large amount of the correctional budget. For example, if a correctional system is receiving 800k in cash from the current system, it is less attractive to switch to Ameelio, a platform that isn't offering any kickbacks or commissions. In such an environment, we encourage local political leaders, like the mayor or county executives, to backstop the anticipated budget shortfall. Without Ameelio's free service, this conversation would have not been possible.",
