If you've been good the year before, you're more likely to do very well the next year. When I was in college though, I was actually rather unfocused. I had my own loves in my life that were not taught. All the way through school we had nothing about computers. No books in bookstores, not even magazines, and that was the passion of my life. \n\nSo I stumbled into things by accident, and I'm very thankful for all those accidents. But I tended to get an idea in my head, and I'd just want to go off in that direction and do it. A focused student is someone who does all the right homework and gets all the right grades and they answer all the questions the same as somebody else that's called smart, you know. And I don't know, I always wanted to be in a different world, think differently.

        "body": "Hi Clyde, thanks. I left Apple partly because i wanted to be, like, a normal person. I didn't want to seek wealth and power, because in my mind it often corrupts people, and I didn't want to be that person who runs a company. The first time I left Apple was an odd accident. I had a plane crash as a pilot. I didn't come out of an amnesia state for five weeks where I didn't know time was passing. When I came out of the amnesia I realized that the Macintosh team (they were my favorite, most creative thinking team at Apple, and I was on that team), would be fine without me. \n\nSo I called up Steve Jobs and told him \"Macintosh team's in great shape, I'm gonna go back to college and get my degree.\" I had one year left to go. If I waited another year it would be too late to ever go back to college again actually. So I went back to Berkeley under the fake name Rocky Raccoon Clark, and that's what it says on my Berkeley diploma. That was the first time I left Apple. I came back and worked as an engineer. When the Macintosh project failed we had to recover with some Apple II projects, took us into the Apple IIGS to keep some money coming into the company for a while as we built the Macintosh market. And then I left the second time because I love startups. I love just a group of two or three or five people talking about an idea and going out and making it a reality. It may not be all the millions and billions of dollars in the world, but it's something you're doing yourself. The idea I came up with was for the first universal remote control, the CL 9 Core, so I left Apple to build that.",
