So I spent three books (Osama, The Violent Century and A Man Lies Dreaming) trying to figure it out and then wrote Unholy Land as a sort of coda.\n\nI think pulp - or any kind of genre really - is really interesting because it has certain forms, rules, expectations, and that's actually a lot like reality, or the way reality is presented to us. So looking at how TV or the news or now the Internet presents \"the world\" to us is the same sort of question as how does a fantasy text work. Which is an interesting theme! Or at least I thought so. My next book is a clown western though.\n\nAnd sometimes I just love doing pulp just for the hell of it. One of the most fun things I've done recently is a series of vampire mysteries stories which will be serialised on [tor.com](https://tor.com) from November this year. It's very much me just having fun - though the plotting is hell! It's very tongue in cheek but still plays fair with the reader. It's nice sometimes not to take myself too seriously!\n\nLavie.",

So I spent three books (Osama, The Violent Century and A Man Lies Dreaming) trying to figure it out and then wrote Unholy Land as a sort of coda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think pulp - or any kind of genre really - is really interesting because it has certain forms, rules, expectations, and that&amp;#39;s actually a lot like reality, or the way reality is presented to us. So looking at how TV or the news or now the Internet presents &amp;quot;the world&amp;quot; to us is the same sort of question as how does a fantasy text work. Which is an interesting theme! Or at least I thought so. My next book is a clown western though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sometimes I just love doing pulp just for the hell of it. One of the most fun things I&amp;#39;ve done recently is a series of vampire mysteries stories which will be serialised on &lt;a href=\"https://tor.com\"&gt;tor.com&lt;/a&gt; from November this year. It&amp;#39;s very much me just having fun - though the plotting is hell! It&amp;#39;s very tongue in cheek but still plays fair with the reader. It&amp;#39;s nice sometimes not to take myself too seriously!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lavie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And they basically just asked me and then I said I'd do it if I could do it with Lavie, because I didn't want to do it alone.

A partial list of where they stand:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Favors ranked choice: Christina Henderson, Monica Palacio, Ed Lazere, Will Merrifield, Ann Wilcox, Chander Jayaraman&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opposes ranked choice: Robert White, Vincent Orange, Michangelo Scruggs, Marcus Goodwin, Alexander Padro, Marya Pickering&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Fenit Nirappil, D.C. government reporter&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think what Silvia and I wanted to do was not &amp;quot;review&amp;quot; so much as *discuss* books, and to focus on the stuff no one else does. I did notice some of the column readers find it frustrating! I also think there&amp;#39;s so much focus on new stuff all the time, and it&amp;#39;s lovely that we can do that while also taking a step back and talking about really old books we think people would enjoy. But that&amp;#39;s just the way the column evolved, other people might well have done it very differently!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lavie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Besides, there are no SFF imprints in Mexico and they are rare even in Spain, which has greater acquisition power. Most of them are very small efforts. SFF is simply not the kind of stuff that is easily published in Latin America in the original Spanish, although bestselling books do get translated (yes, we did get Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, etc). It’s a similar situation in Canada. We basically only have literary publishers and no SFF genre publishers of note in Latin America. \n\nLavie was just in Avilés, Spain attending the Celsius festival recently, so he rather than me would be able to tell you about the Spanish scene there. In Latin America I can tell you most of the festivals focus not around literature but big TV/movie properties. Star Wars, Marvel, etc. \n\nSilvia Moreno-Garcia",

Besides, there are no SFF imprints in Mexico and they are rare even in Spain, which has greater acquisition power. Most of them are very small efforts. SFF is simply not the kind of stuff that is easily published in Latin America in the original Spanish, although bestselling books do get translated (yes, we did get Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, etc). It’s a similar situation in Canada. We basically only have literary publishers and no SFF genre publishers of note in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lavie was just in Avilés, Spain attending the Celsius festival recently, so he rather than me would be able to tell you about the Spanish scene there. In Latin America I can tell you most of the festivals focus not around literature but big TV/movie properties.

I&amp;#39;m also reducing the space I&amp;#39;m devoting to tomatoes and peppers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

My security advice for most people hasn't changed, though: 1) Update your software, to make sure you've got security patches. 2) Use a password manager. The biggest mistake most people make is  re-using passwords on multiple sites. A really long, complicated password isn't effective if you use it everywhere. In terms of password managers, I like Dashlane and 1Password. 3) If something sketchy happens, check your PC or Mac for malware. The free Malwarebytes is great. - Geoff",

My security advice for most people hasn&amp;#39;t changed, though: 1) Update your software, to make sure you&amp;#39;ve got security patches. 2) Use a password manager. The biggest mistake most people make is  re-using passwords on multiple sites. A really long, complicated password isn&amp;#39;t effective if you use it everywhere. In terms of password managers, I like Dashlane and 1Password. 3) If something sketchy happens, check your PC or Mac for malware. The free Malwarebytes is great. - Geoff&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The tl;dr: [Apple / Google are building a system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/10/apple-google-tracking-coronavirus/) that would use people’s phone Bluetooth radios to log the people they pass by as they go about their days. Then, later on, if someone was tested and confirmed to be infected, the system would go back and send automated alerts to everyone they’d come in contact with over the last two weeks, giving them details on how to reach their local health department and recommending they self-quarantine. \n\nIf it works – huge ‘if’ – it could be the key to getting us all out of the house again. I’d love to have an app that told me if I’d passed by someone who was infected. And they’ve designed some fairly innovative crypto math stuff to protect privacy: Every social interaction is given a random number; those numbers are stored on people’s phones and deleted every 14 days; no personal, location or other data is stored; it’s all voluntary, etc.\n\nI’d talked to some researchers working on an identical idea before Apple / Google came out with their proposal. They’re really optimistic that this is, y’know, not a silver bullet, but a step towards helping people understand their health status and make better decisions about what they do after the lockdowns end. \n\nBut there are a ton of reasons to be skeptical. We've never tried anything like this before. We’ve never had big tech companies or health authorities telling people to download a Bluetooth app. The system depends on not just getting the tech right - the Bluetooth integration, the API calls, all the local health apps that will sit on top, etc. - but also getting people to trust the system enough to download it, keep it on their phones, submit their own infection status, etc. \n\nBluetooth has some big technical and privacy advantages over GPS, and it’s more precise for short-range interactions, but the signal can also go through walls, floors of a building, etc. So you could falsely get alerted that you were exposed to an infection, which could freak you out, make you stay home from work, separate from your family, etc. The system could also miss errant coughs or sneezes, since it requires two people to be near each other for a few minutes before it creates a “contact event.” And of course everyone’s phones and comfortability around their Bluetooth settings are different, so it’s just sort of a big technical nightmare. \n\nSeveral countries are trying this now, and the early results are not that convincing. Singapore, the most prevalent, has only had about 1 in 5 people download it so far. The fewer people use it, the less effective the system will be at catching infectious spread; some researchers think you’d need 60% of a population to use it for it to really work. I’m doubtful the U.S. could ever get anywhere close to that adoption rate. There’s also just an innate distrust some people have for Big Tech that – even with some of the privacy controls they’re baking in – will lead to people actively deciding against trying it out. - Drew",

Then, later on, if someone was tested and confirmed to be infected, the system would go back and send automated alerts to everyone they’d come in contact with over the last two weeks, giving them details on how to reach their local health department and recommending they self-quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it works – huge ‘if’ – it could be the key to getting us all out of the house again. I’d love to have an app that told me if I’d passed by someone who was infected. And they’ve designed some fairly innovative crypto math stuff to protect privacy: Every social interaction is given a random number; those numbers are stored on people’s phones and deleted every 14 days; no personal, location or other data is stored; it’s all voluntary, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d talked to some researchers working on an identical idea before Apple / Google came out with their proposal. They’re really optimistic that this is, y’know, not a silver bullet, but a step towards helping people understand their health status and make better decisions about what they do after the lockdowns end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are a ton of reasons to be skeptical. We&amp;#39;ve never tried anything like this before. We’ve never had big tech companies or health authorities telling people to download a Bluetooth app. The system depends on not just getting the tech right - the Bluetooth integration, the API calls, all the local health apps that will sit on top, etc. - but also getting people to trust the system enough to download it, keep it on their phones, submit their own infection status, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth has some big technical and privacy advantages over GPS, and it’s more precise for short-range interactions, but the signal can also go through walls, floors of a building, etc. So you could falsely get alerted that you were exposed to an infection, which could freak you out, make you stay home from work, separate from your family, etc. The system could also miss errant coughs or sneezes, since it requires two people to be near each other for a few minutes before it creates a “contact event.” And of course everyone’s phones and comfortability around their Bluetooth settings are different, so it’s just sort of a big technical nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several countries are trying this now, and the early results are not that convincing. Singapore, the most prevalent, has only had about 1 in 5 people download it so far. The fewer people use it, the less effective the system will be at catching infectious spread; some researchers think you’d need 60% of a population to use it for it to really work. I’m doubtful the U.S. could ever get anywhere close to that adoption rate. There’s also just an innate distrust some people have for Big Tech that – even with some of the privacy controls they’re baking in – will lead to people actively deciding against trying it out. - Drew&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I usually write more profiles and trend stories, but the question is still relevant for those. To me, a lot of it depends on the source's willingness to go on the record. For example, Mark Maske and I did a story this year (https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/23/colin-kaepernick-had-quiet-ally-roger-goodell-his-nfl-tryout-still-unraveled/) about Colin Kaepernick's workout. We'd heard from a former league official that Roger Goodell actually wanted Kaepernick in the league, because he felt it provided fewer PR/political headaches than having him out of the league. We also heard from others in league circles that Dr. Harry Edwards had consulted Goodell on the workout. So we called Edwards, and he said on the record that Goodell had told him he wanted Kaepernick in the league. I trusted that first source, but I probably wouldn't have felt confident writing that piece of information without an additional source. And if Edwards hadn't been on the record, it would have been a tough call. But having two sources, one of them on the record, made it an easy call. Sometimes it's murkier; if you think someone is lying to you on the record, that doesn't automatically mean you get to throw up your hands and say, \"Hey, he/she said it.\" \nIt's a good and interesting question, but there's not a one-size-fits-all answer.",

My favorites are squalane oil, jojoba oil, borage oil, prickly pear seed oil, and castor seed oil. Here are some things to think about:\n\n1. What is your skin type? This will determine which oil might suit you.  Some oils like jojoba and squalane are more amenable to a variety of skin types. \n2. What is the oil's composition? Learning the difference between linoleic acid vs. oleic acid helped me a lot. I generally look for oils that typically have a higher amount of linoleic acid.\n3. I've used the comedogenic scale to narrow down which oils I might want to try. The scale goes from 0-5 and rates an oil based on its comedogenicity or ability to clog our pores.; 0-2 is usually OK for acne-prone types. It isn't totally foolproof, but I knew which oils to stay away from. I use [this scale as a guide](https://www.herbaldynamicsbeauty.com/blogs/herbal-dynamics-beauty/understanding-the-comedogenic-scale-for-oils-and-butters).

I wouldn't add the oil unless you feel like your skin is still dry;  If you do need it, the oil would go underneath your SPF. At night, I would try the same routine and add the oil as the very last step in your routine as needed. You also don't need to wear SPF at night. I'd be careful with the Pixi Glow tonic. It has glycolic acid in it, which can be great but a lot for first-timers. Maybe try using the toner once a day to see how your skin responds. Best of luck! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Nia",

Here&amp;#39;s the order: cream cleanser, glow tonic, Neutrogena gel cream, and sunscreen  (AM). I wouldn&amp;#39;t add the oil unless you feel like your skin is still dry;  If you do need it, the oil would go underneath your SPF. At night, I would try the same routine and add the oil as the very last step in your routine as needed. You also don&amp;#39;t need to wear SPF at night. I&amp;#39;d be careful with the Pixi Glow tonic. It has glycolic acid in it, which can be great but a lot for first-timers. Maybe try using the toner once a day to see how your skin responds. Best of luck! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Nia&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I've tested a lot of CeraVe's products and think most of them are solid!  Tretinoin is a pretty aggressive retin-A so it actually should help with fine lines ad dark circles in the eye area, but I think it requires testing and even asking your doctor for advice.

        "body": "Hey PS4 community! Gene Park here of The Washington Post. I have played and beaten Death Stranding, and wanted to make a FAQ specifically for fans of Kojima and who are familiar with his theatrics and aesthetic. I'll copypasta some of the article for those who hit the paywall. Help me make this piece better, and ask any questions you might have about the game, and I can respond here!\n\n \n\n&gt;**Wait. Uh oh. Did Kojima pull another Phantom Pain and there’s barely any cutscenes? Is the story as disjointed?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No and no. This is in reference to when Kojima’s previous employer Konami had rushed the game out (after a very expensive production period). The game released in a clearly unfinished state, with large elements of the story cut out. This was the [beginning of the end of Kojima and Konami’s 30-year relationship](https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10220356/hideo-kojima-konami-explainer-metal-gear-solid-silent-hills). Kojima eventually cut ties and formed his own company, Kojima Productions, a rare feat in Japan’s gaming industry. Death Stranding is Kojima Production’s first effort.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And after a relatively quick three years (especially for something this large and expensive), Death Stranding is a complete project from beginning to end. No matter how you might digest the story, it’s clear that Kojima and his team are telling the story they set out to do. You can begin and end the game feeling like you have a finished product.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wow, so are there lots of cutscenes, even ones not shown in the exorbitantly long trailers?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh, BB, don’t worry. You will get more cutscenes than you could bargain for. Several of them run well over an hour. There is more footage here to fill more than entire season of TV.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You’ll get plenty of gameplay sandwiched in between them, but long cutscenes are essentially your reward for completing a significant portion of the game.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the story is not disjointed. We’ll get into the mythology later, but as far as the goal of the game goes, it’s actually very straightforward for most of the game. Your objective is as clear as it’s been in video games, ever since Super Mario Bros. asked players to “go right.” Instead, Kojima is asking you to take Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) to go west.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**OK so what is the game about? Are the trailers lying to us?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The trailers are not lying to us, for once. In fact, my biggest advice for anyone is to trust the trailers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The trailers show the core gameplay. It’s a lot of walking. You’re going to hear “walking simulator” a lot, and it’s not inaccurate. It’s absolutely about making deliveries. [Watch Kojima’s 49-minute demonstration of the game](https://youtu.be/2JdEeGHEaNU). He gives you more than enough information about how exactly the game plays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The game is, for the most part, about being a lonely, introverted Norman Reedus walking across America from east to west with a mission to reconnect the Internet and the world during an ongoing mass extinction event. This focus rarely strays throughout the journey, and even the detours ultimately go toward this goal.",

I'm the Washington Post (Gene) and I put together a quick FAQ targeted directly toward fans of Kojima and his aesthetic. \n\nI'll copypasta some of the content below. Let me know if there are any questions you might have that I could try to answer about the game (without spoiling it!): \n\n&gt;**Wait. Uh oh. Did Kojima pull another Phantom Pain and there’s barely any cutscenes? Is the story as disjointed?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No and no. This is in reference to when Kojima’s previous employer Konami had rushed the game out (after a very expensive production period). The game released in a clearly unfinished state, with large elements of the story cut out. This was the [beginning of the end of Kojima and Konami’s 30-year relationship](https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10220356/hideo-kojima-konami-explainer-metal-gear-solid-silent-hills). Kojima eventually cut ties and formed his own company, Kojima Productions, a rare feat in Japan’s gaming industry. Death Stranding is Kojima Production’s first effort.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And after a relatively quick three years (especially for something this large and expensive), Death Stranding is a complete project from beginning to end. No matter how you might digest the story, it’s clear that Kojima and his team are telling the story they set out to do. You can begin and end the game feeling like you have a finished product.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wow, so are there lots of cutscenes, even ones not shown in the exorbitantly long trailers?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh, BB, don’t worry. You will get more cutscenes than you could bargain for. Several of them run well over an hour. There is more footage here to fill more than entire season of TV.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You’ll get plenty of gameplay sandwiched in between them, but long cutscenes are essentially your reward for completing a significant portion of the game.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the story is not disjointed. We’ll get into the mythology later, but as far as the goal of the game goes, it’s actually very straightforward for most of the game. Your objective is as clear as it’s been in video games, ever since Super Mario Bros. asked players to “go right.” Instead, Kojima is asking you to take Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) to go west.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**OK so what is the game about? Are the trailers lying to us?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The trailers are not lying to us, for once. In fact, my biggest advice for anyone is to trust the trailers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The trailers show the core gameplay. It’s a lot of walking. You’re going to hear “walking simulator” a lot, and it’s not inaccurate. It’s absolutely about making deliveries. [Watch Kojima’s 49-minute demonstration of the game](https://youtu.be/2JdEeGHEaNU). He gives you more than enough information about how exactly the game plays.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The game is, for the most part, about being a lonely, introverted Norman Reedus walking across America from east to west with a mission to reconnect the Internet and the world during an ongoing mass extinction event. This focus rarely strays throughout the journey, and even the detours ultimately go toward this goal.",

The matte finish feels just crispy enough under your fingertips. Your index fingers nestle into a slightly deeper scoop on the trigger buttons. Like resting your hands in slime, it’s tactile bliss, ASMR for the grabbers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Both airy and sturdy, the discounted ($199), handheld-only “Lite” model of Nintendo’s hit console Switch is the most comfortable mobile gaming device ever made. The more comfortable on-the-go experience is so good that, even if you already own the mobile-capable Switch, you should consider picking up a “Lite.” And the price is right.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I’ve played every iteration of Nintendo’s handhelds, even the Game and Watch series (my first video game ever was “[Greenhouse](https://gamevaluenow.com/nintendo-game-watch/green-house-gh54?gameid=24)”). All of them, even the beloved DS series, were never known for their comfort. Devices would be too thick, too thin, too tall, too heavy. The dual screens of the DS made them feel top heavy. Hand cramps became an acceptable strain. Only two other devices even approached this level of comfort: the Game Boy Advance and Sony’s PlayStation Vita, but neither knows the human hand as well as the Switch Lite.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This time, the directional pad makes its official triumphant return, feeling about as good as Nintendo’s already excellent Pro Controller for the Switch. The other buttons mimic that feeling: a stronger but quieter click. More travel time for the buttons gives you more confidence with each press.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nintendo wisely matched the bezel of the screen to each of the system’s three color offerings: gray, turquoise and yellow. Even though the screen is smaller (5.5 inches vs. the 6.2 on a normal console), the bezel doesn’t overshadow it. The old Switch looks like a [flatscreen CRT](http://www.allsecurityelectronics.net/store/pc/catalog/SMC-150F.jpg) compared to the Lite.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 720p output is same resolution as the handheld version of the Switch. But because of the smaller screen, more pixel density results in a crisper looking image, even if it’s the same thing. One thing to look out for: Be wary of games with heavy reading. Text was already a struggle to read on the Switch’s handheld mode, and it’s worse on the smaller screen. Most developers have been designing fonts optimized for a smaller screen, but older games not updated will suffer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also be wary of the speakers, which are now mostly located at the bottom of the system, as opposed to only the back. Covering the bottom — by, say, resting the unit on your stomach — will muffle sound. But because the Switch Lite weighs at a sprite 0.66 lbs., you probably won’t be covering the speakers with the bottom of your palms. You could lay in bed and hold the system for hours without tiring. The built-in speakers sound a bit lighter than the original console, but you’re better off using headphones anyway.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It’s also become far more sensible as a pocket device. We still wouldn’t recommend it, but the option is there. It actually looks like it makes sense in a back pocket.",

In those cases, we made sure to also check if the pharmacy pill counts were large for the county the pharmacy as located in as a way to show that even if the pill count was low within the nearby area, the pharmacy may very well still supply a large amount pills across the county.\n\nThese are all estimates but we still felt pretty good about the results.

And it didn’t.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As Viser reported, Biden said in a 1975 interview in a Delaware-based publication named People Paper:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“I oppose busing. It’s an asinine concept, the utility of which has never been proven to me,” he said. “I’ve gotten to the point where I think our only recourse to eliminate busing may be a constitutional amendment.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Biden recognized that such comments could prompt some to lump him in with racists. “The unsavory part about this is when I come out against busing, as I have all along, I don’t want to be mixed up with a George Wallace,” he said, referring to the segregationist governor of Alabama.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“The real problem with busing,” he said, was that “you take people who aren’t racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children’s intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school . . . and you’re going to fill them with hatred.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He contended that being bused, while bad for white students, hurts black children, too. An African American child is sent to a white school in a wealthy neighborhood, then “back to the ghetto. How can he be encouraged to love his white brothers? He doesn’t need a look at ‘the other side,’ he needs the chance to get out of the ghetto permanently,” Biden said.",

And then in 2014 our longtime book critic Jonathan Yardley announced he was stepping down -- so I made my case. \n2. I track publishers' newsletters and places like Kirkus and Publishers Weekly. I also get deluged with pitches from publishers and agents every day. And I also receive some 20-30 or even more books by mail every day at the newsroom. From those I start sifting. But I also try to set my own agenda and decide that there is some particular topic I want to write about, and I start looking for books related to that. That might include old books. For instance, in advance of the Mueller Report, I recently read a bunch of old special counsel reports from Watergate, Iran-contra, Clinton/Lewinsky, etc -- and that led to this [recent piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/22/every-report-past-presidential-scandal-was-warning-why-didnt-we-listen/?utm_term=.1df6c615311b). \n3. I normally go through each book three times -- once a full detailed read, making lots of notes and underlining key passages; then a second read where I focus on the stuff I marked the first time, highlighting the most interesting material; and then a third read where I focus just on the highlighted material and dump all of it into a computer file. So I end up with like a 3,000-word file of notes, quotes, ideas, questions -- and that becomes the raw material for the review. It takes a long time to go through that process, but then I feel like I really know the book and writing the review actually doesn't take that long.\n4. Funny you bring up Ender's Game -- I really enjoyed that book so many years ago, and the whole Ender series, too. (Speaker for the Dead was my favorite.)",

The rules do not say whether this report has to be short or long. It’s Mueller’s choice. But the rules seem to preclude him from publishing his own book of findings like those published from the work of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.  \nJustice Department policy also holds a sitting president cannot be indicted, and several former prosecutors have suggested Mueller will follow that. In that case, evidence about Trump could be included in the confidential report to the attorney general but ***may not be made public.***  \nOn the other hand, another part of the special counsel rules requires the attorney general to make his own report. That report goes to the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary committees in the House and Senate.  \nTo keep an attorney general from quietly snuffing out a special counsel investigation, the attorney general must explain any cases in which the attorney general stopped the special counsel from taking action because it was “so inappropriate or unwarranted” that it could not be allowed. If Mueller wanted to charge someone and the attorney general forbade it, it would seem that action would have to be revealed to Congress. Nothing in the rules requires the revelations to Congress to be confidential. Nor do they say whether that report is short or long. So Barr must make a report and, once again, can decide how detailed to be.  \nIf they are not satisfied that the full story has been released, congressional Democrats may try to subpoena the report and have Mueller testify in committee.",

The rules do not say whether this report has to be short or long. It’s Mueller’s choice. But the rules seem to preclude him from publishing his own book of findings like those published from the work of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Justice Department policy also holds a sitting president cannot be indicted, and several former prosecutors have suggested Mueller will follow that. In that case, evidence about Trump could be included in the confidential report to the attorney general but ***may not be made public.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the other hand, another part of the special counsel rules requires the attorney general to make his own report. That report goes to the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary committees in the House and Senate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To keep an attorney general from quietly snuffing out a special counsel investigation, the attorney general must explain any cases in which the attorney general stopped the special counsel from taking action because it was “so inappropriate or unwarranted” that it could not be allowed. If Mueller wanted to charge someone and the attorney general forbade it, it would seem that action would have to be revealed to Congress. Nothing in the rules requires the revelations to Congress to be confidential. Nor do they say whether that report is short or long. So Barr must make a report and, once again, can decide how detailed to be.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If they are not satisfied that the full story has been released, congressional Democrats may try to subpoena the report and have Mueller testify in committee.\n\n \n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My first job was to write up a summary of the events, including quotes, for the rest of the reporters -- hundreds at a media filing center in Hanoi and many more back in Washington -- who were not permitted into the meeting. So my mind was not on the history of the moment. I then saw on Twitter that many North Korea experts said it was the first time Kim had responded to a foreign reporter. My main thought was, Why did he decide to engage. Obviously it's not something we might ever know but some ideas would be that it is just another small step in his effort to present himself as a global figure or that he had seen Trump parry with reporters in Singapore and in Hanoi and figured he could do it to -- or that he wanted to show Trump he wasn't scared.

My first job was to write up a summary of the events, including quotes, for the rest of the reporters -- hundreds at a media filing center in Hanoi and many more back in Washington -- who were not permitted into the meeting. So my mind was not on the history of the moment. I then saw on Twitter that many North Korea experts said it was the first time Kim had responded to a foreign reporter. My main thought was, Why did he decide to engage. Obviously it&amp;#39;s not something we might ever know but some ideas would be that it is just another small step in his effort to present himself as a global figure or that he had seen Trump parry with reporters in Singapore and in Hanoi and figured he could do it to -- or that he wanted to show Trump he wasn&amp;#39;t scared. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We saw him three times the day I was in the press pool -- a one-on-one meeting with Trump, a photo-op stroll with Trump by the Metropole hotel pool, and a bilateral meeting with aides. The day before, Kim had two photo-ops with Trump, including an initial meeting and a dinner. During that first meeting, he looked uncomfortable and I was watching on a TV feed. Kim sat on the front of his chair -- Trump does this too -- and held his left arm in a very uncomfortable way with his wrist twisting in and exposing a gold watch under his dark Mao suit jacket sleeve. I remember thinking this was strange. I got the sense that Kim was trying to project an image of a global statesman but it was still new to him. He has made only a handful of trips out of the country since taking power in 2011 and only in the past year -- to South Korean, China, Singapore (for first Trump summit) and Vietnam. He's in his mid-30s and to be seated next to a showman like Trump with the press corps crowding in, it must be somewhat uncomfortable for him.  ",

We saw him three times the day I was in the press pool -- a one-on-one meeting with Trump, a photo-op stroll with Trump by the Metropole hotel pool, and a bilateral meeting with aides. The day before, Kim had two photo-ops with Trump, including an initial meeting and a dinner. During that first meeting, he looked uncomfortable and I was watching on a TV feed. Kim sat on the front of his chair -- Trump does this too -- and held his left arm in a very uncomfortable way with his wrist twisting in and exposing a gold watch under his dark Mao suit jacket sleeve. I remember thinking this was strange. I got the sense that Kim was trying to project an image of a global statesman but it was still new to him. He has made only a handful of trips out of the country since taking power in 2011 and only in the past year -- to South Korean, China, Singapore (for first Trump summit) and Vietnam. He&amp;#39;s in his mid-30s and to be seated next to a showman like Trump with the press corps crowding in, it must be somewhat uncomfortable for him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I was the White House pool reporter for Thursday, the day of the summit, which meant I was among 13 reporters from the U.S. press corps to be allowed into the photo ops. We had a general sense that if we got Kim Jong Un to respond to a question it would be both newsworthy and historic.

Let there be no doubt as to what they were up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I was kept in total isolation for the entire 544 days of my imprisonment, first in solitary confinement then with one other cellmate and no access to other people. I was subjected to months of interrogations on charges that were beyond ridiculous. I was denied medical access and decent food. I suffered dramatic and rapid weight loss, various physical infections, I developed respiratory problems, depression and other issues I never had before. All that said, I know that others have been, are, and will be treated even worse than I was in the same prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
