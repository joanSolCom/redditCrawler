I'd love to talk more with you about it!

BobTeam Israel falls under a program I started called Operation Medal 26 which seeks to field women&amp;#39;s teams and men&amp;#39;s teams in bobsled, with the likely medal contenders as women&amp;#39;s bobsled in 2026, and likely Olympic contenders being my four man Bob team in 2022. I&amp;#39;d love to talk more with you about it! Feel free to drop me a line &lt;a href=\"mailto:adam.edelman@olympian.org\"&gt;adam.edelman@olympian.org&lt;/a&gt; or 6172370242 WhatsApp!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also another 4 man team, you can find them on Facebook as Israel Bobsled Sled 1. Since 18 is a lucky number in judaism (chai/life) our sled is called Sled 18&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I come from a modern orthodox background and there's a strong sense among Israelis, but to a larger degree Jews in general that we just aren't built for sports, with a few exceptional athletes (Hank Greenberg, etc.)  This makes me disappointed, as it makes no sense, but is a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, where we don't grow a new generation of athletes, and sports has the potential for so much good.  The Olympics was a platform from which to speak on the issue, so to speak.  I figured if I could get Israel to the games in skeleton, a sport I was told it would be impossible to do so in, that it could have enough of an impact to get the ball rolling on a foundation I would like to start one day to get more Israeli's and Jews involved in sport, with funding and coaching, etc.\n\n2.  I've thought about this a few times.  On the road for skeleton, it was really important to me to remember that.  I burned out so many times, but a couple of times, one in particular (2016,) caused me to actually quit, for all of 12 hours. Among other things, remembering that I was the only person who could get Israel there, or at least stood the best shot, was a motivation to not quit, as I thought it would be stealing Israel's chance to make it.\nNowadays, to me it's rather negligible.  It's a natural phenomena, hedonistic adaptation, where we achieve something we really want and then a new baseline is set.  So for me I don't think of it that much, sometimes even cringing when being introduced as such cuz I prefer the journey be the focal point. \nHowever, there are a few times when I do reframe it objectively--it's a funny thing to think about in a way, but I also realize there will be someone very soon (i'm coaching a couple of our athletes in skeleton now) who will surpass me by far, and nothing brings me greater pleasure, since it means I was a step for the federation/team to move higher.  I was okay, but we will have someone so far better.\nI also view it objectively nowadays when trying to put together, fund, and pilot a bobsled team to 2022. This leads into your 3rd question:\n3. Yes, I am bobsledding to try and get ISR to the 2022 Games.  The chances are really good except for one aspect--I am now broke, and bobsled costs over 100k a year on a pretty pared-down budget.  If I can somehow fundraise enough to get us going, then you'll have a good chance of seeing us at 2022.",

Among other things, remembering that I was the only person who could get Israel there, or at least stood the best shot, was a motivation to not quit, as I thought it would be stealing Israel&amp;#39;s chance to make it.\nNowadays, to me it&amp;#39;s rather negligible.  It&amp;#39;s a natural phenomena, hedonistic adaptation, where we achieve something we really want and then a new baseline is set.  So for me I don&amp;#39;t think of it that much, sometimes even cringing when being introduced as such cuz I prefer the journey be the focal point. \nHowever, there are a few times when I do reframe it objectively--it&amp;#39;s a funny thing to think about in a way, but I also realize there will be someone very soon (i&amp;#39;m coaching a couple of our athletes in skeleton now) who will surpass me by far, and nothing brings me greater pleasure, since it means I was a step for the federation/team to move higher.  I was okay, but we will have someone so far better.\nI also view it objectively nowadays when trying to put together, fund, and pilot a bobsled team to 2022. This leads into your 3rd question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am bobsledding to try and get ISR to the 2022 Games.  The chances are really good except for one aspect--I am now broke, and bobsled costs over 100k a year on a pretty pared-down budget.  If I can somehow fundraise enough to get us going, then you&amp;#39;ll have a good chance of seeing us at 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I come from a modern orthodox background and there's a strong sense among Israelis, but to a larger degree Jews in general that we just aren't built for sports, with a few exceptional athletes (Hank Greenberg, etc.)  This makes me disappointed, as it makes no sense, but is a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, where we don't grow a new generation of athletes, and sports has the potential for so much good.  The Olympics was a platform from which to speak on the issue, so to speak.  I figured if I could get Israel to the games in skeleton, a sport I was told it would be impossible to do so in, that it could have enough of an impact to get the ball rolling on a foundation I would like to start one day to get more Israeli's and Jews involved in sport, with funding and coaching, etc.\n\n2.  I've thought about this a few times.  On the road for skeleton, it was really important to me to remember that.  I burned out so many times, but a couple of times, one in particular (2016,) caused me to actually quit, for all of 12 hours. Among other things, remembering that I was the only person who could get Israel there, or at least stood the best shot, was a motivation to not quit, as I thought it would be stealing Israel's chance to make it.\nNowadays, to me it's rather negligible.  It's a natural phenomena, hedonistic adaptation, where we achieve something we really want and then a new baseline is set.  So for me I don't think of it that much, sometimes even cringing when being introduced as such cuz I prefer the journey be the focal point. \nHowever, there are a few times when I do reframe it objectively--it's a funny thing to think about in a way, but I also realize there will be someone very soon (i'm coaching a couple of our athletes in skeleton now) who will surpass me by far, and nothing brings me greater pleasure, since it means I was a step for the federation/team to move higher.  I was okay, but we will have someone so far better.\nI also view it objectively nowadays when trying to put together, fund, and pilot a bobsled team to 2022. This leads into your 3rd question:\n3. Yes, I am bobsledding to try and get ISR to the 2022 Games.  The chances are really good except for one aspect--I am now broke, and bobsled costs over 100k a year on a pretty pared-down budget.  If I can somehow fundraise enough to get us going, then you'll have a good chance of seeing us at 2022.",

        "body": "Thanks for getting the ball rolling, haha!\nI always answer any questions sent through IG/email as well.\n\n1. Bobsled and skeleton combine 2 elements, of equal importance--\na. the sprinting start--that lasts about 5 seconds\nb. the driving that takes place over 55 seconds or so--i.e. the rest of the run.\nThe reason that bobsled and skeleton are considered skill-transfer sports is that the sprinting portion is highly important, and people who are strong and fast do very well here.  That means pulling from athletics, rugby, etc.  For bobsled, a lot of people come from Rugby as they have good mass and can run fast.  For skeleton, far more come from direct sprinting backgrounds.  It's not advantageous in skeleton to have a large bulky build as it messes with your aerodynamics, especially if your arms are spilling out the sides of your sled, you're in for a world of pain as you graze the walls.\n\n2. I am modern ortho, yep :)  I stuck to Thurs/Fri competitions for my sliding go-around from '14-18.  Faith is highly important not because it is faith, but because it reminds me often that I represent something.  Personally I think that all athletes are just people out for a joyride, essentially--the only importance any one of us has is solely because of the flags we wear--that we were only allowed to wear because we were given our country's license to do so.

That means pulling from athletics, rugby, etc.  For bobsled, a lot of people come from Rugby as they have good mass and can run fast.  For skeleton, far more come from direct sprinting backgrounds.  It&amp;#39;s not advantageous in skeleton to have a large bulky build as it messes with your aerodynamics, especially if your arms are spilling out the sides of your sled, you&amp;#39;re in for a world of pain as you graze the walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am modern ortho, yep :)  I stuck to Thurs/Fri competitions for my sliding go-around from &amp;#39;14-18.
