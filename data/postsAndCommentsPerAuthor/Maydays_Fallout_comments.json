Modern wicca is relatively new (started between 1930s-1960s depending on who you ask) and often combines Celtic symbols and imagery with traditional pagan symbols. The crescent moon upturned like that is usually a nod to the Horned God (crescent moon looks like horns). That combined with the pentagram, which represents the 5 elements and the connection between them, could be interpreted as the Horned God and all his energy is interwoven into the 5 elements. Adding the Celtic knots/symbol throughout the crescent moon is *most likely* a stylistic choice. Most of the time adding Celtic symbols to a Wiccan/Pagan symbol is just to make the symbol look cool. Sometimes the knots that are added do have meanings but one as simple as this *probably* doesn't. My guess is that the entire symbol together originates in modern Wicca (I'm guessing Gardnerian Wicca since that's the most popular, and if the crescent moon is to represent the Horned God, it would not be from Dianic Wicca). I'll try to do some more focused digging, but starting with a Gardnerian Wicca website about symbols might be a good place to start. \n\nEdit: this link (while not the most reputable of available sources) gives a huge description of a ton of possible origins/interpretations of the symbol. One possible option is modern wicca combining Celtic and traditional pagan symbols to recreate a branch of wicca similar to that of the old Celtic religions. https://pin.it/3iZXYQR",

It's all due to the level of histamine in the food, which changes depending on how its cooked, how long it's been ripe, if its refrigerated or not, etc. I highly suggest having your mother go see an actual allergist. She very well could actually have MCAS, ARFID, or a combination of the two. The majority of foods you mentioned are things I'm also allergic to. The only way to know for sure is to have her see an actual allergist! Another way you can start testing if she has it is have her take some antihistamines daily for 3 weeks or so (if it is safe for her to do so), start her on xyzal, zyrtec, fexofenadine, as well as pepcid. If her symptoms start to improve, then she very well probably has either MCAS or Histamine Intolerance. I am in NO WAY a doctor or even really qualified to be offering medical advice, so of course check with her doctor before having her test out any medications. Hope you and your mother find answers soon :)",

If her symptoms start to improve, then she very well probably has either MCAS or Histamine Intolerance. I am in NO WAY a doctor or even really qualified to be offering medical advice, so of course check with her doctor before having her test out any medications. Hope you and your mother find answers soon :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Not the best, but it does work!\n2) Nasalcrom! It&amp;#39;s a cromolyn solution that&amp;#39;s meant to be a nose spray. You can buy it at Walmart. It&amp;#39;s safe to use on skin, and it&amp;#39;s the only thing I&amp;#39;ve found to help the itching 99% of the time! I just spray a pump or two on the area that&amp;#39;s itching and rub it in. Sounds weird but if it works it works lol! It&amp;#39;s also the only thing I&amp;#39;ve found that helps with my acne caused by MCAS&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It is an immune disorder in which the Mast Cells (a type of white blood cell) are overactive, trying to protect the body to such a high level that it is detrimental and causes harm to the body. One major characteristic is allergies or sensitivities to various things that the &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; person wouldn&amp;#39;t react to such as foods, smoke, air pollutants, dust, hormones, emotions, scents, stress,  vibrations, magnetic fields, EMFs, pressure changes, altitude changes, hot or cold weather, sudden temperature changes, etc. A lot of people who have it don&amp;#39;t even realize they have it until someone points out an unusual symptom. It&amp;#39;s a relatively new disorder so not a lot of doctors know about it, let alone know how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Modern wicca is relatively new (started between 1930s-1960s depending on who you ask) and often combines Celtic symbols and imagery with traditional pagan symbols. The crescent moon upturned like that is usually a nod to the Horned God (crescent moon looks like horns). That combined with the pentagram, which represents the 5 elements and the connection between them, could be interpreted as the Horned God and all his energy is interwoven into the 5 elements. Adding the Celtic knots/symbol throughout the crescent moon is *most likely* a stylistic choice. Most of the time adding Celtic symbols to a Wiccan/Pagan symbol is just to make the symbol look cool. Sometimes the knots that are added do have meanings but one as simple as this *probably* doesn't. My guess is that the entire symbol together originates in modern Wicca (I'm guessing Gardnerian Wicca since that's the most popular, and if the crescent moon is to represent the Horned God, it would not be from Dianic Wicca). I'll try to do some more focused digging, but starting with a Gardnerian Wicca website about symbols might be a good place to start. \n\nEdit: this link (while not the most reputable of available sources) gives a huge description of a ton of possible origins/interpretations of the symbol. One possible option is modern wicca combining Celtic and traditional pagan symbols to recreate a branch of wicca similar to that of the old Celtic religions. https://pin.it/3iZXYQR",

The only way to know for sure is to have her see an actual allergist! Another way you can start testing if she has it is have her take some antihistamines daily for 3 weeks or so (if it is safe for her to do so), start her on xyzal, zyrtec, fexofenadine, as well as pepcid. If her symptoms start to improve, then she very well probably has either MCAS or Histamine Intolerance. I am in NO WAY a doctor or even really qualified to be offering medical advice, so of course check with her doctor before having her test out any medications.

When I was first diagnosed I was very scared and felt like shit constantly due to starting so many meds. I mentioned in another comment, but I ended up thinking \"is it even worth trying to live with this?\" So I ended up talking to a doctor, getting mental help, and got put on several antidepressants. They have significantly helped. Aside from the meds, I track my moods daily using the Pixels app. It allows me to put my general day into a single color to represent my mood so that I can better track what events put me down. Therapy isn't my thing (tried and hated it) so I try to rely on my friends and family when I need to vent. They're very understanding of my situation so they try to listen to me whenever I need a shoulder to lean on. I went through a huge grieving process, and am still going through it. I'm currently going through acceptance. I've accepted that this is my reality, and that I don't have a chance for remission, and that I can't ever had kids (family is a huge value to me, so I've come to accept that I will instead be adopting). I'm doing a lot better than I was when I first got diagnosed, but I still have issues. My boyfriend and I are currently working on a system to signal when I need help, and when I just want to be able to do something myself. Sometimes I do need help but want so badly to push through it and do it myself, so when he offers to help, it makes me upset. \n\nIn the future I wish to find two or three entirely safe meals that I can eat daily while trying to reintroduce other foods one at a time to really narrow down what triggers me. I also hope to be able to see a specialist to do further testing to find an exact cause of my MCAS, as well as to diagnose any other comorbid conditions",

COVID is very very dangerous to those of us who have started treatment however. With MCAS, your immune system is super hyperactive. It's always going way above the rate of a \"normal\" person. COVID also makes your immune system hyperactive, so an MCAS patient with COVID has a *double* hyperactive immune system, which is not good to say the least. Unfortunately, the only confirmed case of an MCAS patient with COVID (that I know about) died from COVID pretty early on into having symptoms. Since then, the community has been very scared, and the vast majority of us are hiding in our homes, and will be until 2021. \n\nCytokine storms are also very very common in MCAS! Sometimes it's hard to tell if I'm on a \"histamine overload\" or if I'm in a Cytokine storm. COVID also happens to be the reason why a lot of MCAS drugs are currently in a shortage. I'm having problems accessing pepcid (prescribed as it is triple the strength of what you can buy at walmart) and quercetin. The community completely understands testing these drugs against COVID, and even recommended doing so, but we just wish that the media would wait a little while longer before announcing these drugs to the public.",

He knew of MCAS so he knew what symptoms to look out for. He did very minimal testing. First he made me read off which symptoms of MCAS I had based off the wikipedia page. I had all but the two bone ones. He scraped a tongue suppressor across my back to test for Dermatographism. He then did a blood test for serum tryptase. It came back negative, which is usually indicative of MCAS (positive is more for Mastocytosis) so that confirmed his suspicions. I didn't have to do the bone biopsy or anything like that which is nice. \nThere is a fantastic support group on Facebook called Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Community that has a map of competent physicians who know of MCAS and are able to diagnosis, and treat you. They also have subgroups for each region of the US, as well as for other countries (I'm the moderator of the one for the Midwest). I highly highly recommend checking the group out!",

They're prevalent in the majority of MCAS patients, but not everyone with MCAS has them! For some people, MCAS is an entirely neurological disease. For some, it's purely skin related. For others, it's purely digestive issues. MCAS varies from person to person, but there are some trends. So it is indeed entirely possible that MCAS only presents itself as neurological symptoms in some people. However this would make it extremely difficult to diagnose it as a doctor is first going to evaluate your symptoms when it comes to diagnosing you. If you do have purely neurological MCAS, you're more likely to get a diagnosis of something like ME/CFS (what you may know as chronic fatigue syndrome) first.",

They&amp;#39;re prevalent in the majority of MCAS patients, but not everyone with MCAS has them! For some people, MCAS is an entirely neurological disease. For some, it&amp;#39;s purely skin related. For others, it&amp;#39;s purely digestive issues. MCAS varies from person to person, but there are some trends. So it is indeed entirely possible that MCAS only presents itself as neurological symptoms in some people. However this would make it extremely difficult to diagnose it as a doctor is first going to evaluate your symptoms when it comes to diagnosing you. If you do have purely neurological MCAS, you&amp;#39;re more likely to get a diagnosis of something like ME/CFS (what you may know as chronic fatigue syndrome) first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The Algiz rune is typically used in Ostara rituals to symbolize rebirth, and more often protection from a higher being. The Algiz rune, combined with the representation of the Horned God, is probably the Witch in question asking for protection from Horned God. Since this was at a cemetery, you can probably bet that they were asking for protection from the Horned God over a loved one as they journey through the after life through to rebirth on Earth. Ostara is typically celebrated either around Easter or on the Spring Equinox. Eggs are the most used symbol and offering for the Gods on Ostara as they symbolize rebirth. The Eggs were used as an offering to the Horned God (the Horned God is the one who controls/runs Spring while the Goddess is being Rebirthed/starting her life cycle over). Modern/American Wiccans often use other symbols from other cultures in their rituals, which would explain the Om being there. This was definitely a ritual by a Modern Wiccan. \n-Source: I am Wiccan.\n\nEdit: The first symbol is actually a Pentacle, not a pentagram. A Pentacle is a Wiccan religious symbol of protection. It is a pentagram but with a circle around it. Not a huge difference but most Wiccans get pissed off if you mix the two. As far as the lines connecting multiple Pentacles, that's more than likely just a stylistic choice of personal meaning to the Witch.

I am on antidepressants and hemp oil to help with the depression and anxiety, as well as a secondary antidepressant/sleeping med to help with the insomnia and depression caused by my MCAS and those have helped tremendously. It may seem like a lot of meds at first, but it does get slightly easier as you go along and figure out what works for you. \n\nMCAS and Mastocytosis are both types of Mast Cell Disease (there are actually 3 types of MCAS but the differences are basically negligible for your purposes and they're all just summed up as simply \"MCAS\"). The most basic difference is that with Mastocytosis, you have an abundance of Mast Cells, causing you to have an abundance of released histamine and other mediators. With MCAS, you have a normal amount of Mast Cells, but your mast cells are overactive, resulting in an abundance of released histamine and other mediators. Both give the same/similar effect, but the reason for that effect is different. While both are still technically classified as rare diseases, MCAS is likely not \"rare\" but rather \"uncommon\" as it is estimated that more people have MCAS but remain undiagnosed since it is difficult to test for. It is still difficult to test for Mastocytosis, but you can get a test for the count of mast cells in your tissue, which would lead to a diagnosis for Mastocytosis.

When you get diagnosed with a chronic illness, you go through a grieving process. It's why most of us receive therapy as we begin treatments to help us live. For some of us, that results in us accepting a horrible death as an inevitable fate. For others, this acceptance never comes and they continue to fight for their lives everyday. If it came between me and a 15 year old healthy girl, I would gladly give my life to save hers. That's a personal decision because I've come to terms with my condition. If it came between me and a healthy 80 year old, I would still make the same decision and give my life. Not everyone wants to do so though. Some people still want to live and keep fighting for their life. I'm not fighting for my rights or my life here in this thread.

All we are asking for is compassion and to not be forgotten or shoved aside in this whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: it is important to understand something here. When you get diagnosed with a chronic illness, you go through a grieving process. It&amp;#39;s why most of us receive therapy as we begin treatments to help us live. For some of us, that results in us accepting a horrible death as an inevitable fate. For others, this acceptance never comes and they continue to fight for their lives everyday. If it came between me and a 15 year old healthy girl, I would gladly give my life to save hers. That&amp;#39;s a personal decision because I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with my condition. If it came between me and a healthy 80 year old, I would still make the same decision and give my life. Not everyone wants to do so though. Some people still want to live and keep fighting for their life. I&amp;#39;m not fighting for my rights or my life here in this thread. I&amp;#39;m fighting for those who are being forgotten, shoved aside, and for those who can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I would keep up with them if I were you. I went from getting cedar fever once a year (and being out of school for 2-3 weeks because of it and often ending up in the hospital due to it) to not getting reactions to cedar fever at all the year that I started the shots (about 7 months into the shots). I also think it depends on what type of immunotherapy you're doing. I recommend the shots, and every allergist I have talked to has recommended the shots over the oral drops (do your own research of course! Just stating my experience here). \n\nI'm allergic to yeast, both baker's and brewer's. I'm not sure if a yeast infection correlates to a yeast allergy (I've never had a yeast infection despite my allergy, though I'm only 20 and live a relatively boring life, so I may just be young and lucky here). That would definitely be something to ask your doctor and do independent research on!\n\nEdit: just realized you mentioned \"shots\" in your original post. So definitely keep up with them! They take a while to \"kick in\".\n\nEdit 2: also you could be experiencing the shots working, but new allergies developing. If the shots are helping with allergies x, y, and z, then a new or previously undiscovered w allergy could be affecting you now that your body isn't focusing much on x,y,z. If that makes sense? I had this happen to me and walnut trees. Was a real pain in the rear, and had to get walnut pollen added to my vials.",

Some of it is metered parking, others you can buy a parking permit and park in a commuter lot. The campus itself is walkable, and shops and stores are incredibly close to campus that you could feasibly walk (or drive/bike) to downtown without an issue. Game days are kind of an issue, as the entire city is out walking in downtown and on campus, so driving through the hoards of people can be a pain sometimes.\n\n-There is quite a few clubs in lincoln, including an LGTBQ+ club that all of my friends seem to go to. Most of the clubs are located downtown, and get quite busy on the weekends. Though I would say it appears that the regular bars (and bar &amp; grill restaurants) are more popular most of the time, ESPECIALLY on game days. \n\n-Winters tend to vary, but it's pretty mild in terms of snow compared to the North. This winter is supposed to be our worst one yet. I'd say the worst problem is the ice. It ices here very quickly. The first snow tends to happen in October, then theres a breakfast of 60° weather, then actual winter hits and more snow piles up, with temperatures tending to average between 0° and 25° (at least on campus).\n\n-As far as a party scene goes, UNL is a dry campus, so no alcohol is allowed anywhere on campus, even on game days! There is of course those who decide to drink anyways, but most of the \"partying\" in the sense you're thinking of occurs in frat houses and freshman dorms. \n\n-I'd say the only thing you *need* to know is that game days can be extremely hectic. Tons of people (the stadium becomes a city), lots of balloons in the air, fireworks, etc. UNL follows traditions as if it's life depends on it.
