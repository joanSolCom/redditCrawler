I was in 5th grade. It was pre-internet and my world involved a small group of friends and the couple of streets in my neighborhood. Within a week or so of my family announcing this move, we were in a flat in the middle of Paris, not being able to speak the language, not knowing where we would be living or going to school, not really knowing anyone. I was 10 and my little sister was a baby. I was old enough to remember it vividly, but not really old enough to help help. It was a true culture shock, but a turning point that exposed my family to the possibilities of the world and I am eternally grateful for that experience. Not many get that chance.\n\nWe eventually came back to Houston and while I was older and had moved out of the house, my parents via my stepdad's employer would have stints living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Singapore as well and although I didn't live there with them, I did get to visit both on multiple occasions. \n\nIn recent years we have thrown out the more common traditions of the holidays and replaced them with a trip where we all just experience a new city and each other instead of opening presents under a tree or a home-cooked meal. \n\nMy sister, who also values travel and experiences, currently lives and works in Europe so our holiday adventures are sometimes the one time in the year I get to see her. \n\nBetween personal travel and through work, I have had the chance to explore and shoot some really incredible places. Some of my favorites are: Rio and Singapore, Paris, Prague, Palm Springs, Sydney, Cape Town, NYC (never disappoints!), Rome, Doha, Munich and Budapest! MY MOST FAVORITE PLACE TO VISIT AND SHOOT WAS NO DOUBT TOKYO/KYOTO JAPAN! I am of Japanese heritage and not only it is an incredible place to experience and shoot, but it was deeply meaningful to me and my family to experience and explore Japan together.

It was lovely: [https://toddspoth.photofolio.com/projects/personal/1](https://toddspoth.photofolio.com/projects/personal/1)\n\nHere is another great solo moment during a visit to upstate-New York.

I used to go all out and bring my entire camera kit on personal trips, but in recent years I am most happy taking my Fuji mirrorless camera with one lens, having less to worry about, focusing on having more authentic moments with my family and just taking a photo when I want to rather than trying to make all of the photos I can in case I don't get a chance to come back to a certain place.",

They say a picture is worth 1000 words and honestly that holds up in most cases. \n\nThere are times when the moving picture/film/cinema/video are very impactful, but as a still photographer, when you capture the EXACT moment or just the right expression it can be very powerful and the resulting still image can cause the viewer to sit with whatever feeling or mood or tone that lives within that singular frame allowing them to turn inward in thought and that is something that doesn't always happen when there are multiple frames or the medium is moving in a way that is fleeting or otherwise distracting.\n\nThat said, I do dabble in not only video, but creating gifs, as well, of moments where a bit of movement of parts or the frame as a whole adds a different context or meaning. It's a fun practice. \n\nHere is an example of a gif I created: [https://toddspoth.photofolio.com/projects/hip-hop/34](https://toddspoth.photofolio.com/projects/hip-hop/34)\n\nIt is a vintage tape deck at the legendary Sugarhill Studios here in Houston. Sugarhill is the oldest continuously operating recording studio in the US and everyone from Freddy Fender to Beyonce have cut hits there. I have frames of just the tape deck alone, but animating just the reels themselves gives the casual viewer an instant understanding of what they are looking at. It's not the best gif in the world or even my best, but an example of ones that I enjoy putting together from the still frames I capture.\n\nWith the new website I launched in January, I have all but completely sun-setted my previous photo blog, however the blog is still viewable as well as a page that I used to populate with many of the gifs I have created over the years. It's fun to look at and you can scroll down for a while before you run out of gifs! [http://toddspothblog.com/gif/](http://toddspothblog.com/gif/)\n\nThe actual proper answer to this question is quite simply, SMELL! For better or worse it is clearly impossible to convey what a photo smells like within a recorded still photographic frame. Many great still photographs illicit multi-sensory responses in the viewer where one might be able to recall a specific memory of a scent, however you must have that already built in your database/brain. It would be rad if somehow one could accurately record a smell (efficiently) and create scratch and sniff photos!

        "body": "Great question! And you are very correct, most of the time we get a VERY small shooting window. Sometimes just seconds! I am very thankful for any commission that gives me extended time with talent especially when they are famous, well-known or just really busy. Great examples are \"Day in the Life\" commissions where I follow a person around for a block of time. \n\nWhen I only have a few seconds, I still have to meet the person, build rapport, gain their trust and also make a photo that conveys the appropriate expression and mood for the end result. This takes a lot of time to learn how to do effectively and it has nothing to do with shutter speeds or f-stops. It's about learning people and planning.\n\nWhen I prepare to shoot anyone, especially folks that are celebrities, I like to understand them, who they are and what they do. Most photographers and people don't do their research and the result they get speaks to that and the experience that they walk away with is commensurate with the amount of work and preparation they put in.\n\nBefore I photographed The Property Brothers, I watched an entire season of their show and really dove deep to try and understand who they were as people. I only had a few minutes with them and ended up convincing them to sit on the roof of a building that was nearby. I was prepared and wasn't running around frantic. They felt this and obliged much to the surprise of their PR managers. After the shoot, they wanted a photo with us and ended up literally picking me and my assistant up for the photo. It's a hilarious photo that is somewhere out there!\n\nMy portrait of The Property Brothers during a very short 5 minute window: [https://www.instagram.com/p/BUAKKbAjNTB/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUAKKbAjNTB/) for The New York Times.\n\nPrior to meeting Marcus Luttrell aka The Lone Survivor at his very very secretive aka its not even on satellite maps, I rewatched The Lone Survivor movie and found moments during the shoot to stop and engage with him about a particular scene. He felt my sincerity and stopped and we had about an hour long conversation about his time as a US Navy Seal and he ended up telling me and my assistant things that he openly said he had never told anyone including the folks that made the movie about him. I was touched by that and I get chills thinking about that story and the others that he shared with me about not only his service but his own hilarious interactions with celebrities. Even if I don't agree with someone politically, they are human and so am I and they WANT to connect. They are used to very shallow interactions with folks so I have found that if you do your research, slow down and give them the respect, they will return it ten-fold.\n\nMy portrait with Marcus Luttrell at his ranch: [https://www.instagram.com/p/BeHaeV-nHAD/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeHaeV-nHAD/) for Men's Journal.\n\nPrior to each shoot, I like to build a dossier with a page of current photos of the person, docs like their wikipedia page or bio and really take the time to consume various forms of media on the person. It's not just famous musicians or athletes either. I photographed a billionaire wind energy entrepreneur here locally in Houston last year and I spent hours watching videos of him doing industry talks on wind power etc prior to the shoot. Most of it went straight over my head, but I was genuinely interested and I brought that energy to the set, he noticed and gave me more in terms of expression and time and allowing me to create the photos that I needed and wanted in exchange. It's subtle and you might not always get the scorecard at the end, but after years of doing this, it's clear that other photographers don't always have the same experience as I do.\n\nAs for the shoot itself, whether its a huge set with lots of lights or just you with 1 camera and 1 lens, solo, run through the shots you want to take and rehearse it over and over so that when you do get that 30 seconds or a minute with the person, you will have already worked out any possible hiccups or issues. It's a finely tuned dance that takes years of experience to really nail. Regardless of how much research you do, celebrities can be fickle so try and think of everything before they get there and DO NOT OVERLOOK THEIR EXPERIENCE overall. It's about the feeling they walk away with and not just the resulting photograph. \n\nI could go on forever about this, but I hope this helps!

Most photographers and people don&amp;#39;t do their research and the result they get speaks to that and the experience that they walk away with is commensurate with the amount of work and preparation they put in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I photographed The Property Brothers, I watched an entire season of their show and really dove deep to try and understand who they were as people. I only had a few minutes with them and ended up convincing them to sit on the roof of a building that was nearby. I was prepared and wasn&amp;#39;t running around frantic. They felt this and obliged much to the surprise of their PR managers. After the shoot, they wanted a photo with us and ended up literally picking me and my assistant up for the photo. It&amp;#39;s a hilarious photo that is somewhere out there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My portrait of The Property Brothers during a very short 5 minute window: &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BUAKKbAjNTB/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BUAKKbAjNTB/&lt;/a&gt; for The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to meeting Marcus Luttrell aka The Lone Survivor at his very very secretive aka its not even on satellite maps, I rewatched The Lone Survivor movie and found moments during the shoot to stop and engage with him about a particular scene. He felt my sincerity and stopped and we had about an hour long conversation about his time as a US Navy Seal and he ended up telling me and my assistant things that he openly said he had never told anyone including the folks that made the movie about him. I was touched by that and I get chills thinking about that story and the others that he shared with me about not only his service but his own hilarious interactions with celebrities. Even if I don&amp;#39;t agree with someone politically, they are human and so am I and they WANT to connect. They are used to very shallow interactions with folks so I have found that if you do your research, slow down and give them the respect, they will return it ten-fold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My portrait with Marcus Luttrell at his ranch: &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BeHaeV-nHAD/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BeHaeV-nHAD/&lt;/a&gt; for Men&amp;#39;s Journal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to each shoot, I like to build a dossier with a page of current photos of the person, docs like their wikipedia page or bio and really take the time to consume various forms of media on the person. It&amp;#39;s not just famous musicians or athletes either. I photographed a billionaire wind energy entrepreneur here locally in Houston last year and I spent hours watching videos of him doing industry talks on wind power etc prior to the shoot. Most of it went straight over my head, but I was genuinely interested and I brought that energy to the set, he noticed and gave me more in terms of expression and time and allowing me to create the photos that I needed and wanted in exchange. It&amp;#39;s subtle and you might not always get the scorecard at the end, but after years of doing this, it&amp;#39;s clear that other photographers don&amp;#39;t always have the same experience as I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the shoot itself, whether its a huge set with lots of lights or just you with 1 camera and 1 lens, solo, run through the shots you want to take and rehearse it over and over so that when you do get that 30 seconds or a minute with the person, you will have already worked out any possible hiccups or issues. It&amp;#39;s a finely tuned dance that takes years of experience to really nail. Regardless of how much research you do, celebrities can be fickle so try and think of everything before they get there and DO NOT OVERLOOK THEIR EXPERIENCE overall. It&amp;#39;s about the feeling they walk away with and not just the resulting photograph. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on forever about this, but I hope this helps!

In fact running a small business / being an entrepreneur in general is very all-consuming. I have gotten to do things many folks can only dream of, however many days I dream of being able to shut off the 24/7 stress and that lil voice in my head that is constantly reminding me to \"do more\" and \"keep pushing\". I often envy my friends that have typical 9-5's with a steady paycheck and good benefits, but in the end, that life isn't for me...at least not yet perhaps.  \n\n\nOne of the reasons why I opted to take this path was because of the variance in what I do daily. I do a good mix of editorial, commercial and corporate work. I do a lot of different kinds of shooting and working. Some days I am an army of one and other days I am leading a set with lots of different people and moving parts. This balance helps fight things from getting too boring.  \n\n\nIn addition I love learning new things. I am (trying) to teach myself new skills like 3D currently. I find something that I am passionate about and really try to learn everything I can about it whether its photo-related, music-related, etc. I learn a ton through following appropriate subs here on Reddit and soaking it all in!  \n\n\nI still love creating photos, music, art, and discovering new passions so as much as I have days where I'm a bit over it, I still love what I do and what I have the access to do.  \n\n\nThe work/life balance part is a bit different and definitely a challenge. I have a loving and supportive partner who gets it. That definitely helps!",

Generally any artist that gives me that trust back and allows me access is great and honestly more than I can ask, especially if we don't know each other as well. The first time I photographed Big Sean, I was hired by his team to shoot his I Decided tour kickoff show. I didn't know what kind of access I would be getting. Sometimes you only get to shoot the performance itself, sometimes only a certain number of songs, etc. When I arrived his manager quickly ushered me backstage, introduced me to Sean and his family and just left me there.   \n\n\nWhen I am meeting an artist for the first time I make sure to let them know, most of the time non-verbally, that I am a friend and that I can be trusted. This happens a lot of different ways. You just have to read the situation. Within minutes he was changing in front me and discussing private affairs. I know when to put the camera down and be respectful and I know when to pick it up. After several minutes Sean asked me to do some portraits and we made a bunch of really great images together. I continued to document him backstage and after a short while it was just the two of us. He mentioned to me that he had some distant cousins and family that he had never met about to come into the room. I could feel a bit of apprehension and anxiety from him about the meeting. The family came in and I grabbed some images and even helped his little cousin take some of photos of them with her cell phone. During that interaction I felt Sean give me this look like, \" Yo this is weird, but I have known you the longest out of any person in this room.\" It was subtle, but I understood what he was telling me with his eyes and after that, we I was with him all night and we made a lot of great content.   \n\n\nIt's folks like that who don't have to be nice, don't have to let me in, but that night he gave me so much in return and I will always be thankful for those interactions. It's what I strive for when working with known artists especially when meeting them for the first time.\n\nHere is one of the images we made during that first meeting:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/BZP0eMdHxFe/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZP0eMdHxFe/)",
