        "body": "Great question! It depends on the UBI supporter you ask, but in general they talk about some combination of higher taxes (returning to the more progressive tax code that helped the economy boom in the 1950s, for example), deficit spending,  and/or moving spending so UBI replaces current programs. The basic idea is that UBI is an investment that will grow the economy in the long run, ultimately paying for itself. UBI advocate Scott Santens has a good breakdown here, highly recommended: [https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7](https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7)\n\nPersonally, I think UBI is one of those economic stimuli we can't afford \\*not\\* to do -- just like the (minimal) bipartisan efforts to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic. That added a trillion dollars to the deficit at a stroke, but also if we didn't do it, we were looking at another Great Depression. We still might be if we don't provide people with more stopgap cash, such as the proposed $2,000 a month. -- Chris",

It depends on the UBI supporter you ask, but in general they talk about some combination of higher taxes (returning to the more progressive tax code that helped the economy boom in the 1950s, for example), deficit spending,  and/or moving spending so UBI replaces current programs. The basic idea is that UBI is an investment that will grow the economy in the long run, ultimately paying for itself. UBI advocate Scott Santens has a good breakdown here, highly recommended: &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7\"&gt;https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think UBI is one of those economic stimuli we can&amp;#39;t afford *not* to do -- just like the (minimal) bipartisan efforts to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic. That added a trillion dollars to the deficit at a stroke, but also if we didn&amp;#39;t do it, we were looking at another Great Depression.

Another great Dame one is the Kip, which is also really easy to hold and perfect if you're more into lipstick-style vibrators with more of a flutter sensation to it.\n\nFor dual stimulation or wearables, We-Vibe's Sync is by far the best. It's a g-spot and clitoral stimulator you wear during penetrative sex. It's less versatile in terms of positions you can use it in, but if g-spot is where it's at for you, that one's unbeatable.\n\nAnother really interesting one that's kind of like a reinvention of the cock ring (cause, let's be real, cock rings *suck* at stimulating clitorises) is Mystery-Vibe's Tenuto. That one's good for stimulating both parties at the same time.\n\nBut also keep in mind that toys not specifically made for couples can still be used during partnered sex. If we're talking hetero couples, most clitoral stimulator work for penetrative sex. Think outside the box for ways to integrate any solo toy into partnered sex. One thing I loved was using remote-controlled vibrators (like Lovense's Lush or OhMiBod's Esca) that my partner would control while I gave him oral.\n\nGeneral tip: play around with couples toy alone first. Figure out how it fits with your body, what modes you like most, or whether it works for you at all. Give every new toy a few tries before you write it off, too, because it takes time to figure out any new tech.",

It&amp;#39;s less versatile in terms of positions you can use it in, but if g-spot is where it&amp;#39;s at for you, that one&amp;#39;s unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another really interesting one that&amp;#39;s kind of like a reinvention of the cock ring (cause, let&amp;#39;s be real, cock rings &lt;em&gt;suck&lt;/em&gt; at stimulating clitorises) is Mystery-Vibe&amp;#39;s Tenuto. That one&amp;#39;s good for stimulating both parties at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also keep in mind that toys not specifically made for couples can still be used during partnered sex. If we&amp;#39;re talking hetero couples, most clitoral stimulator work for penetrative sex. Think outside the box for ways to integrate any solo toy into partnered sex. One thing I loved was using remote-controlled vibrators (like Lovense&amp;#39;s Lush or OhMiBod&amp;#39;s Esca) that my partner would control while I gave him oral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General tip: play around with couples toy alone first. Figure out how it fits with your body, what modes you like most, or whether it works for you at all. Give every new toy a few tries before you write it off, too, because it takes time to figure out any new tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Reporting on the way YouTube's algorithms surfaced violent or absurd content for children is actually partly why I stopped showing my daughter YouTube videos. If I understand correctly, YouTube has since altered its algorithm to de-emphasize videos created by content farms or bots, but the problem still exists because of the platform's massive scale. \n\nIn terms of whether AI-created content is appropriate for children (or human beings in general), I'd have to lean toward no -- at least not yet. I don't think our design ethics have caught up with the products we're making and how they're reshaping our world. \n\nIt was important to me that our list of \"safe places\" reflect products designed by human beings with thoughtful and rigorous approaches to making digital media for children. I talked to a human being responsible for every product we listed and tried to match their rhetoric against their business model, community guidelines, and safety practices. In some cases, there were products I was seriously considering including but the folks behind them couldn't or wouldn't get on the phone. Those products were not included in our roundup. \n\nIf you're interested in how the issues you're hinting at shape the app market for kids, you might find this blog post from Bjorn Jeffrey, the co-founder and former CEO of Toca Boca, fascinating.

Just between the algorithm recommending questionable or downright horrifying videos to younger viewers and the presence of trolls and strangers with bad intentions in the comments, you can start to see why it's not a safe environment for young users. That's why the company rolled out YouTube Kids, which is an experience parents can have total control over. I will say that when I tested YouTube Kids for this story, I really liked how I could vet channels and videos. Of course, we didn't recommend it in our list of the safest places.   \n\n\nBut I'll also share a personal anecdote. When my daughter was much younger, around 2 or 3, we used to show her farm animal videos on YouTube, thinking they were cute and harmless. In a way, they were. But then somehow the algorithm started recommending and autoplaying \"unboxing\" videos -- or clips of kids opening cool toys or gifts.

Here&amp;#39;s the skinny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our main website pulls re-tweet data directly from Twitter, whereas our mobile app gets information from a TweetMeme API, an aggregation service. A quick search on the TweetMeme discussion boards reveals that TweetMeme has been acting strangely, and is often failing to report the correct number of re-tweets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the re-tweet information on our main page is correct. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Alex Fitzpatrick, Community Intern, Mashable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
