So for example, when we filmed emperor penguins in the Antarctic the scientist we worked with said that thanks to our remote penguin cameras we helped save him approximately 10 years worth of research. In addition, Spy Gorilla was able to highlight the social behaviour of mountain gorillas that may have been a lot harder to film or show using traditional filming techniques. So we were able to show how the silverback commands his group very clearly with the help of Spy Gorilla. In addition we also saw a beautiful moment of a young gorilla beating his chest in front of Spy Gorilla that highlighted how youngsters beat their chest as a sign they want to play. So these interactions also help reveal behaviours more clearly for the viewer.",
