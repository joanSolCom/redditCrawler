It was  originally a political compromise with southern slave states to give them more power because their slaves were counted as 3/5th a portion for determining the apportionment of Congressional seats and electors. It is undemocratic and antiquated.\n\nNational popular vote is much better! It guarantees that a candidate who becomes president is the one who is supported by the most people (you can win under the current system with only a small fraction of the vote in theory). It also means that every state matters and not just a few swing states matter because candidates only campaign in states that are closely divided and therefore the candidate can win or lose. 2/3rd to 3/4 of states regardless of size are left out.  Candidates tend to pander to swing states even during non-election season.\n\nEvery vote from every state should count! For more information: https://www.commoncause.org/our-work/voting-and-elections/national-popular-vote/\n\nWe support a lot of other reforms in all sorts of areas.

It was  originally a political compromise with southern slave states to give them more power because their slaves were counted as 3/5th a portion for determining the apportionment of Congressional seats and electors. It is undemocratic and antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;National popular vote is much better! It guarantees that a candidate who becomes president is the one who is supported by the most people (you can win under the current system with only a small fraction of the vote in theory). It also means that every state matters and not just a few swing states matter because candidates only campaign in states that are closely divided and therefore the candidate can win or lose. 2/3rd to 3/4 of states regardless of size are left out.  Candidates tend to pander to swing states even during non-election season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every vote from every state should count!

There is a historic bipartisan support for voting rights (in 2006 the reauthorization of the VRA was passed overwhelmingly in the House and then through unanimous vote in the Senate).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the political parties have coalesced around a set of issues and view points, but we believe our democracy is far too important to be just a &amp;#39;partisan issue&amp;#39; -- voting, our elections, and our campaigns system is how we the people decide who leads us.

It was originally a political compromise with southern slave states to give them more power because their slaves were counted as 3/5th a portion for determining the apportionment of Congressional seats and electors. It is undemocratic and antiquated.\n\nThe cons are many. 1) a candidate can become president who does not have majority support and loses the popular vote, as has happened 5 times 2) only a few swing states matter because candidates only campaign in states that are closely divided and therefore the candidate can win or lose 3) 2/3rd to 3/4 of states regardless of size are left out 4) candidates tend to pander to swing states even during non-election season.\n\nNational popular vote is much better! Every vote from every state should count! For more information: https://www.commoncause.org/our-work/voting-and-elections/national-popular-vote/",

It was originally a political compromise with southern slave states to give them more power because their slaves were counted as 3/5th a portion for determining the apportionment of Congressional seats and electors. It is undemocratic and antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cons are many. 1) a candidate can become president who does not have majority support and loses the popular vote, as has happened 5 times 2) only a few swing states matter because candidates only campaign in states that are closely divided and therefore the candidate can win or lose 3) 2/3rd to 3/4 of states regardless of size are left out 4) candidates tend to pander to swing states even during non-election season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;National popular vote is much better! Every vote from every state should count!

Happily, this has worked in most states and there are only a small few who have not expanded access. \n\nBut even in those states, we are seeing record turnout in early vote and vote by mail.

Happily, this has worked in most states and there are only a small few who have not expanded access. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even in those states, we are seeing record turnout in early vote and vote by mail.

(Instead we get the FCC's compromise \"3rd Way\" protections that are not full common carrier and not, well, nothing).\n\n2) Common Carrier is about nondiscriminatory access to *lawful* content, regardless of origin [your ISP] and destination [the content you want]. Without network neutrality protections, Verizon could play gatekeeper and say to Netflix “pay up if you want access to our customers” OR tell it’s own broadband customers “Sorry, Netflix, is behind a different broadband tier – cough it up if you want to stream”. This is a very real threat, since Verizon has its own video on demand service -- it would be in Verizon’s best interest to slow down / block / degrade / add fees to Netflix to promote its own streaming service.  \n\nThis is why we say the FCC should stand ready to reclassify broadband to full common carrier protections if Verizon wins this case.\n",

To be clear on definitions for a second, poll workers are the folks who actually run the elections process. Poll monitors are the folks that are nonpartisan volunteers to help voters who have problems and support voters from outside the polling place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are lots of ways to get involved! Head to protectthevote.net and choose the role that feels that best for you in your state. States are looking for poll monitors, roving monitors (who stay in their car), social media monitors, and many more. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.Yes! Our volunteers are trained in de-escalation and many poll workers are being trained to deescalate as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This ransomware delivery system was a threat to internet facing election infrastructure systems like voter registration databases and electronic poll books. In recent weeks, U.S. Cyber Command also hacked into Trickbot’s servers and temporarily severed its ties with its victims. \n\nAdditionally, in most states, because of two decades of determined advocacy from Common Cause and our partners, voters mark paper ballots which are the ballot of record.  Paper can't be deleted or changed in a cyber attack.  Many states conduct a post election audit using those paper ballots to either spot check machine function or check the election results.  This use of paper ballots is a wonderful deterrent to cyber attacks which would affect the vote count.  \n\n\nSo, in other words, government agencies, the private sector and state and local governments have been working together to mitigate possible cyber attacks to our election infrastructure which could alter votes, delete or change voter registration data or otherwise wreck havoc with our elections.   \n\nOur long term advocacy against internet voting, for paper ballots and risk limiting audits, are acknowledged to be the best defense against vote changing attacks. Furthermore, this election cycle we have been working at the county level in target states to ensure that when electronic poll books are down, there is paper back up, and when machines fail there are paper ballots.  And states have been working with vendors and DHS to ensure there are adequate back ups to the voter registration databases.  DHS, Cybercommand and the private sector are working together to stop other kinds of attacks.\n\nThere is no 100% assurance, but we have a lot of both low tech and high tech defenses in place to stop the kind of attack you asked about.",

We don't always support one party or one candidate. Instead, we hold power accountable no matter who holds that power. We have a 50 year history of holding Democrats and Republicans accountable to the public and for our democracy. We also don't traffic in false equivalency. That report -- and the other reports we have on the abuses of power by the Trump administration -- are not reflective of a partisan bias, but our response to what we know to be true by this President and his administration. We've challenged Democrats in the past, for example in Maryland where they are the party supporting gerrymandering, or the Obama administration's misuse of the Organizing for Action group that supported his campaign. Most of all, we are fighting for defending and expanding our democracy -- in state houses controlled by Democrats or Republicans, and federally.

Being nonpartisan means we have independence. We don&amp;#39;t always support one party or one candidate. Instead, we hold power accountable no matter who holds that power. We have a 50 year history of holding Democrats and Republicans accountable to the public and for our democracy. We also don&amp;#39;t traffic in false equivalency. That report -- and the other reports we have on the abuses of power by the Trump administration -- are not reflective of a partisan bias, but our response to what we know to be true by this President and his administration. We&amp;#39;ve challenged Democrats in the past, for example in Maryland where they are the party supporting gerrymandering, or the Obama administration&amp;#39;s misuse of the Organizing for Action group that supported his campaign. Most of all, we are fighting for defending and expanding our democracy -- in state houses controlled by Democrats or Republicans, and federally.

(Instead we get the FCC's compromise \"3rd Way\" protections that are not full common carrier and not, well, nothing).\n\n2) Common Carrier is about nondiscriminatory access to *lawful* content, regardless of origin [your ISP] and destination [the content you want]. Without network neutrality protections, Verizon could play gatekeeper and say to Netflix “pay up if you want access to our customers” OR tell it’s own broadband customers “Sorry, Netflix, is behind a different broadband tier – cough it up if you want to stream”.
