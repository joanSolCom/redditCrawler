I print almost entirely on Canvas so I can't say exactly what the cost is for me to print an 8x10 photo print, it would depend mostly on the paper type used.  \n\nI use an archival quality canvas that costs just shy of $200 per 40' x 44\" roll.  I've done the math in the past to figure out my ink / paper cost (Canon actually has a little plugin that will tell you your cost per print based on your paper / ink costs) but I don't remember exactly what it comes out to at the moment. I purchase my stretcher bars from a friend who is a cabinet maker. He makes them only for me (at the moment) and to my specifications, and the price comes out pretty similar to what you'd pay an online company... something like $10 - $12 per 8ft length of stretcher bar.  \n\nMy margins on materials are really, really good, the main thing that justifies my price ($0.55 / sq in) is the time involved. \n\nI think my advice would be to set a realistically obtainable goal, like selling $1000 worth of work, before popping on a printer. While the printer is an awesome tool, it's also going to be a big distraction from the actual creation of art, and when you're early in your career and still defining your style that could be a dangerous thing.  For half of what you're planning to spend on a printer (keep in mind your cost will include materials as well as the actual machine) you can get a LOT of canvas (or other types) of prints created at either a local shop or one of the big names on line (I used to really like Canvas on Demand, their prices are insanely low and the products look great).  Once you've proven to yourself that you can move a more significant amount of work, it'll feel like a much safer investment to purchase your own printer.  \n\nAnd use that for inspiration to get it done. If you KNOW you really want to print your own work, then that's a good motivator to get to that $1k (or whatever number you choose) goal ASAP and maybe it'll only take a few weeks if you pound the pavement hard with that in mind. If you've printed all of your favorite pieces and are offering them up at a reasonable price and they're NOT moving at all, that's something to consider also before making a further investment.  It sucks to have to adjust your art to what the market likes, but we all do it to some extent. Some of my favorite photos have NEVER sold, and some of my best sellers are photos that I don't personally love. \n\nAgain best of luck my friend!",

With a nearly New Moon, the conditions were incredibly dark, clear, and perfect. The only light pollution in this area comes from the small lodge on the Northern side of the lake and was just enough to cast a slight glow on the trees without in any way impeding the view of the incredible Milky Way as it ascended above the Sierra Buttes.\n\nDisclaimer: For those not fortunate enough to have witnessed such a night sky, the answer is NO, the Milky Way does not look like this to the naked eye. My exposure time for each frame was over 3 minutes, allowing the camera to capture much more light than our eyes can perceive.\n\nSeveral landscape oriented (horizontal) photos were captured and combined in order to make one massively detailed final image.",

The only light pollution in this area comes from the small lodge on the Northern side of the lake and was just enough to cast a slight glow on the trees without in any way impeding the view of the incredible Milky Way as it ascended above the Sierra Buttes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: For those not fortunate enough to have witnessed such a night sky, the answer is NO, the Milky Way does not look like this to the naked eye. My exposure time for each frame was over 3 minutes, allowing the camera to capture much more light than our eyes can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several landscape oriented (horizontal) photos were captured and combined in order to make one massively detailed final image.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Of course your results will vary depending on the quality of the sensor and the lens, however you can start learning about this type of photography and getting some really neat results using literally almost any DSLR. \n\n2) Yes, a dark sky is required to get this level of detail, preferably less than a 15% moon and very little ground based light pollution. That being said, a moderate amount of light pollution like you'd find outside a suburb of a medium sized city is not a deal breaker. \n\n3) No, I don't know anything about telescopes, I shoot exclusively through a DSLR. \n\n4) Yes and no. My longest lens is only 300mm, and combined with a star tracker it is capable of taking some ok photos of Andromeda. To get good deep sky details definitely requires a telescope though, which again is not something that I know much about. \n\nOne more free bit of advice. To get started, take any old DSLR and a tripod out to a dark spot and try to take a photo. You'll need to follow the \"Rule of 500\" to figure out the maximum exposure length you can take before star trailing occurs. 500 / focal length = maximum exposure in seconds. So on a 50 mm lens, star trailing will start to occur at 10 seconds. At 24mm it's more like ~20 seconds. So set your camera to this max exposure length, set your f-stop to the widest possible setting, and then start increasing your ISO starting in the 1000+ range until you see interesting results. You'll need to disable auto focus, and manually focus using the screen on the back of the camera. You may need to focus on a distant man-made light if no stars are visible via your screen. You may also need to temporarily turn your ISO up as high as it will go when focusing. \n\nUsing these simple techniques you can see awesome and awe inspiring Milky Way through almost any DSLR camera, though it will be quite noisy upon close inspection. If you master this step, there are many ways to create cleaner and better images. My favorite is a star tracker, though stacking is also super effective. But that's a conversation for another day. Best of luck with the new hobby, it's a lifetime of fascination and fun.",

It may seem counter intuitive, but your own healthy habits and pursuit of your goals and the things that make you happy are even more important now than ever, as a counter to the extremely difficult situation your mom is going through. It's important for you, but also for your mom, to know that you're thriving, and it's going to bring her great joy to hear about the good things in your life and take her mind off her health for a minute. So keep on living, that is my first piece of advice, and don't be ashamed to have happy moments even in the midst of such difficulty. \n\nMy mom had a really severe form of Lymphoma a few years back (which she luckily survived due to really intense chemo) and it's so weird remembering that time. Everything is so vivid and immediate and intense, when you're worried about someone you love who is fighting for their life, and it really gave me such an added appreciation for every moment of life and health and love and beauty, and I think it has permanently changed the way I see the world (for the better). \n\nBe there for your mom however she needs you to be, and let this very real struggle remind you that every moment is so fucking precious. Love that new girlfriend (if you're using the L word yet) more fiercely, and same with your family. Be there with total openness when your mom needs you. Laugh and cry with her and set your ego aside. Thank whoever or whatever you believe in (God? The universe? Your higher self?) for every moment of good health you're lucky enough to experience, for every moment you get with your mom, and for giving you the strength to help your mom through this. Even when you're just doing her laundry for her or making her a meal, try to be grateful that you're there to repay all the kindness she showed you throughout your life. \n\nTruly wishing your mom the best of health and a full recovery.",

Love that new girlfriend (if you&amp;#39;re using the L word yet) more fiercely, and same with your family. Be there with total openness when your mom needs you. Laugh and cry with her and set your ego aside. Thank whoever or whatever you believe in (God? The universe? Your higher self?) for every moment of good health you&amp;#39;re lucky enough to experience, for every moment you get with your mom, and for giving you the strength to help your mom through this. Even when you&amp;#39;re just doing her laundry for her or making her a meal, try to be grateful that you&amp;#39;re there to repay all the kindness she showed you throughout your life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truly wishing your mom the best of health and a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I print almost entirely on Canvas so I can't say exactly what the cost is for me to print an 8x10 photo print, it would depend mostly on the paper type used.  \n\nI use an archival quality canvas that costs just shy of $200 per 40' x 44\" roll.  I've done the math in the past to figure out my ink / paper cost (Canon actually has a little plugin that will tell you your cost per print based on your paper / ink costs) but I don't remember exactly what it comes out to at the moment. I purchase my stretcher bars from a friend who is a cabinet maker. He makes them only for me (at the moment) and to my specifications, and the price comes out pretty similar to what you'd pay an online company... something like $10 - $12 per 8ft length of stretcher bar.  \n\nMy margins on materials are really, really good, the main thing that justifies my price ($0.55 / sq in) is the time involved. \n\nI think my advice would be to set a realistically obtainable goal, like selling $1000 worth of work, before popping on a printer. While the printer is an awesome tool, it's also going to be a big distraction from the actual creation of art, and when you're early in your career and still defining your style that could be a dangerous thing.  For half of what you're planning to spend on a printer (keep in mind your cost will include materials as well as the actual machine) you can get a LOT of canvas (or other types) of prints created at either a local shop or one of the big names on line (I used to really like Canvas on Demand, their prices are insanely low and the products look great).  Once you've proven to yourself that you can move a more significant amount of work, it'll feel like a much safer investment to purchase your own printer.  \n\nAnd use that for inspiration to get it done. If you KNOW you really want to print your own work, then that's a good motivator to get to that $1k (or whatever number you choose) goal ASAP and maybe it'll only take a few weeks if you pound the pavement hard with that in mind. If you've printed all of your favorite pieces and are offering them up at a reasonable price and they're NOT moving at all, that's something to consider also before making a further investment.  It sucks to have to adjust your art to what the market likes, but we all do it to some extent. Some of my favorite photos have NEVER sold, and some of my best sellers are photos that I don't personally love. \n\nAgain best of luck my friend!",

I then mounted and aligned my star tracker and camera, captured a few frames of ground detail, and settled in to wait as the incredible autumn night sky was slowly revealed. With a nearly New Moon, the conditions were incredibly dark, clear, and perfect.

Of course your results will vary depending on the quality of the sensor and the lens, however you can start learning about this type of photography and getting some really neat results using literally almost any DSLR. \n\n2) Yes, a dark sky is required to get this level of detail, preferably less than a 15% moon and very little ground based light pollution. That being said, a moderate amount of light pollution like you'd find outside a suburb of a medium sized city is not a deal breaker. \n\n3) No, I don't know anything about telescopes, I shoot exclusively through a DSLR. \n\n4) Yes and no. My longest lens is only 300mm, and combined with a star tracker it is capable of taking some ok photos of Andromeda. To get good deep sky details definitely requires a telescope though, which again is not something that I know much about. \n\nOne more free bit of advice. To get started, take any old DSLR and a tripod out to a dark spot and try to take a photo. You'll need to follow the \"Rule of 500\" to figure out the maximum exposure length you can take before star trailing occurs. 500 / focal length = maximum exposure in seconds. So on a 50 mm lens, star trailing will start to occur at 10 seconds. At 24mm it's more like ~20 seconds. So set your camera to this max exposure length, set your f-stop to the widest possible setting, and then start increasing your ISO starting in the 1000+ range until you see interesting results. You'll need to disable auto focus, and manually focus using the screen on the back of the camera. You may need to focus on a distant man-made light if no stars are visible via your screen. You may also need to temporarily turn your ISO up as high as it will go when focusing. \n\nUsing these simple techniques you can see awesome and awe inspiring Milky Way through almost any DSLR camera, though it will be quite noisy upon close inspection. If you master this step, there are many ways to create cleaner and better images. My favorite is a star tracker, though stacking is also super effective. But that's a conversation for another day. Best of luck with the new hobby, it's a lifetime of fascination and fun.",

It may seem counter intuitive, but your own healthy habits and pursuit of your goals and the things that make you happy are even more important now than ever, as a counter to the extremely difficult situation your mom is going through. It's important for you, but also for your mom, to know that you're thriving, and it's going to bring her great joy to hear about the good things in your life and take her mind off her health for a minute. So keep on living, that is my first piece of advice, and don't be ashamed to have happy moments even in the midst of such difficulty. \n\nMy mom had a really severe form of Lymphoma a few years back (which she luckily survived due to really intense chemo) and it's so weird remembering that time. Everything is so vivid and immediate and intense, when you're worried about someone you love who is fighting for their life, and it really gave me such an added appreciation for every moment of life and health and love and beauty, and I think it has permanently changed the way I see the world (for the better). \n\nBe there for your mom however she needs you to be, and let this very real struggle remind you that every moment is so fucking precious. Love that new girlfriend (if you're using the L word yet) more fiercely, and same with your family. Be there with total openness when your mom needs you. Laugh and cry with her and set your ego aside. Thank whoever or whatever you believe in (God? The universe? Your higher self?) for every moment of good health you're lucky enough to experience, for every moment you get with your mom, and for giving you the strength to help your mom through this. Even when you're just doing her laundry for her or making her a meal, try to be grateful that you're there to repay all the kindness she showed you throughout your life. \n\nTruly wishing your mom the best of health and a full recovery.",

It may seem counter intuitive, but your own healthy habits and pursuit of your goals and the things that make you happy are even more important now than ever, as a counter to the extremely difficult situation your mom is going through. It&amp;#39;s important for you, but also for your mom, to know that you&amp;#39;re thriving, and it&amp;#39;s going to bring her great joy to hear about the good things in your life and take her mind off her health for a minute. So keep on living, that is my first piece of advice, and don&amp;#39;t be ashamed to have happy moments even in the midst of such difficulty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom had a really severe form of Lymphoma a few years back (which she luckily survived due to really intense chemo) and it&amp;#39;s so weird remembering that time. Everything is so vivid and immediate and intense, when you&amp;#39;re worried about someone you love who is fighting for their life, and it really gave me such an added appreciation for every moment of life and health and love and beauty, and I think it has permanently changed the way I see the world (for the better). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be there for your mom however she needs you to be, and let this very real struggle remind you that every moment is so fucking precious. Love that new girlfriend (if you&amp;#39;re using the L word yet) more fiercely, and same with your family. Be there with total openness when your mom needs you. Laugh and cry with her and set your ego aside. Thank whoever or whatever you believe in (God? The universe? Your higher self?) for every moment of good health you&amp;#39;re lucky enough to experience, for every moment you get with your mom, and for giving you the strength to help your mom through this. Even when you&amp;#39;re just doing her laundry for her or making her a meal, try to be grateful that you&amp;#39;re there to repay all the kindness she showed you throughout your life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truly wishing your mom the best of health and a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Completely right. To continue on with the infrastructure argument, let's talk about healthcare. While it's true that we have a major healthcare _cost_ problem, our healthcare outcomes are on par with most other \"1st world\" countries. We're not the leader by every metric, but we do have a massive and robust system of private and public hospitals, University health systems, and millions of small providers, and while you may go bankrupt if you get really sick (which is a massive issue) any of these hospitals will do their best to save your life when you walk in the door with a gunshot wound. We're also still leading the way in many areas of medical research (yes, even with our science denying orange leader at the helm). What was the last major healthcare breakthrough to come out of Turkey? (Not bashing Turkey, but you can't even compare the historical innovations of the two nations)\n\nOp also mentions our \"broken\" democratic system,  but though it has its flaws, our Constitution has held up pretty well over the last few hundred years despite our two party system and the stupid electoral college. Comparing our imperfect democracy (within which there is room for open debate, criticism of the government, and even the ability to push for change to the system) to China's freedom stifling, totalitarian way of governing is comparing apples to oranges. Even looking at the horrendous \"kids in cages\" issue that was rampant a couple of years ago, the US was in that situation because so many people were seeking the protections and economic opportunities afforded to anyone within these borders. We may have handled that difficult situation poorly, but I think it's to the US's credit that 1) there was a huge public outcry, thanks to our freedom of the press and our ability to protest and speak out. 2) the government felt the pressure from that outcry and responded to it. It doesn't mean we got it right, but it's a world away from the stifled speech and unilateral power the government wields in a country like China. \n\nThe US's infrastructure, record on human rights, continued technological advancements, and freedoms of speech and the press set it world's apart from China or Turkey and most definitely put it in the class of \"developed country\".",

The animation is a little sluggish, as others have mentioned. Without looking at your code, I'm assuming that you're using a CSS blur filter to achieve the background blurring, at the same time that you animate the scale. I believe that's your bottleneck. One thing you could try to improve the animation performance would be to do the blurring of the background image in Photoshop (or similar) and put it in a separate element behind the unblurred bg (and at the correct slightly smaller scale than the unblurred image). Then simply animate opacity (OR opacity and scale if you'd rather), which I think will give a similar effect and will definitely be much more performant. I know it's not as \"fun\" technologically as applying the filter, but this is the game we play lol.\n\nOne other thing to point out is that the way you're scaling your background image, it gets badly squeezed on mobile or odd sized screens, and since Half Dome is such an iconic and well known rock it's very noticeable.

So to accomplish this we would have to stack the Senate with a bunch of new states like Puerto Rico, DC, and San Francisco &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thought it might be worth mentioning the only movement with any legs at all that is actually pushing for a NPV. Seemed relevant to the conversation, I never said it was the best path forward or even that I support it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I've touched on some of the stuff that's worked for me in a few other comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gwteo5/z/fsytvqn) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gwteo5/z/fsyxnqi). \n\nBut let me tell you, it's a constant battle to sell art online. As I said in those other comments, I've come to realize that gaining leads is how you get the best bang for your buck. You may get lucky and get a flood of attention to your site, but if you're not turning those visitors into fans / followers / leads most of them will appreciate your pretty pictures for a minute or an hour and then never return. \n\nI've done paid advertising over the years, on Google , Facebook, Instagram, and even right here on Reddit. From my experience it's incredibly difficult to directly profit from any form of paid ad in this industry. Art is such a \"personal taste\" kind of thing, people hate having it shoved down their throats. I'll still (very occasionally) boost a Facebook post (with varying degrees of success- I did make some good sales when promotng my big pre-christmas print sale last year, but the margins suffered from the high cost of ads) but unless you have a massive ad budget and can afford to burn through $1000 to test a new campaign, I'd stick to the \"organic\" approach as much as possible. That looks like: 1) have mechanisms in place to gather leads. 2) consistently keep putting your work out there to create that trickle (and hopefully occasionally FLOOD) of new fans. 3) collect underpants. 4) profit. \n\nMy DREAM would be to find a paid advertising scheme that produces a consistent positive r.o.i. I'd keep paying for it forever. But from my experience, that's near impossible.\n\nHope that gave you some ideas.",

Most canvases never require that, though. \n\n\nAs for insuring it, it couldn't hurt to add it to a homeowners' or renters' insurance policy, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to get it individually insured. I don't remember the exact dimensions of the piece, but assuming it's about 40\" on the long side the full retail value if custom ordered would be in the $600-$800 range. \n\nThanks again for finding this thread and following my work.

        "body": "Thanks for that! I started out on a cropped sensor Nikon DSLR the D5100. It's not a great low-light camera, but using any dslr and applying the rule of 500 you can start to get really interesting astro photos.\n\nThe rule of 500 says that the longest exposure you can take without getting star trailing is 500 / focal length = max exposure in seconds. So at 50mm, you can take up to a 10s exposure without star trailing.\n\nYou apply this function to take the longest exposure you can, while on a good tripod of course, open your lens up as wide as possible (smallest number, like f/3.2) and then start turning your ISO up from 1000 until you see stars appear. You'll probably be well above 3200 iso and thus will have a lot of noise on all but the best cameras, but you can get very cool photos regardless.  You'll also need to figure out manual focusing in low light, try to use your live view screen on the back of the camera and zoom way in (on the screen, not the lens) to any distant bright light, either in the sky or on land if it's sufficiently far away, then manually focus on the light.\n\nThat's how you get started, and let me tell you, the first time you see the Milky Way through the screen on the back of a camera, you may just giggle like a school girl (I did).\n\nNow I use better full frame Nikon camera bodies like the D800, as well as a handy device called a star tracker which allows you to \"break\" the rule of 500 and shoot much, much longer night sky photos without star trailing (my average exposure time is 3 - 5 minutes).\n\nIt's a great hobby!!",

I've been developing websites for over 20 years, but it's not my full time job anymore and hasn't been since I quit 3+ years ago to do my photography full time. Now I only develop my own projects, and this is one that I've had in the works for over five years (well, that's how long I've been thinking about it and shooting the video). I have to admit that my skills are a little bit out of date, and while I had thought about using this project as a good chance to teach myself react, vue, or one of the more modern js frameworks, I decided to stick with KnockoutJS on the frontend as it's a framework I know very well and works great for the functionality I needed.\n\nThe video is all hosted on Vimeo, and the audio is all hosted on S3, though the site itself lives on a small Cpanel VPS via inmotionhosting. I figured that by allowing Vimeo and S3 to carry the bulk of the file-serving load, I could handle a lot of traffic despite the limits of my VPS.\n\nI was ... sort of ... right, but when the site got popular on /r/internetisbeautiful last week and the traffic started to get close to 3,000 unique visitors per hour, the VPS started to choke. I took some quick action, and within about 1.5 hours I had it functioning (if loading slowly) and survived the hug without getting the post removed. The steps I took to mitigate the effects of the HUG were:\n\n* Move all images over to S3 (duh).\n* Disable my self-hosted Matomo analytics.\n* Move all JS over to S3.\n* Convert my live data-feeds (the lists of video and audio which were being generated on the fly via php / mysqli) into static JSON files and move those over to S3 as well.\n\nIt was hard to make these changes in real time as the site was barely accessible. I made one critical mistake and didn't realize it until about 15 minutes had gone by (corrupted data in the JSON files), but once I corrected that error things ran pretty smoothly. If it continues to be popular I'll move the main site files onto a cloud based provider as well, but that will take a bit more work.\n\nHere's a little graph of the bandwidth spike hitting the main server with the corresponding reductions as I took my mitigation efforts. Note that the number of visitors remained relatively consistent for the duration of this graph, changes are due solely to moving stuff off the server onto S3. The overall bandwidth usage here isn't really that impressive, because like I said, most of the files were served elsewhere, but I still find it interesting: [https://imgur.com/a/Ux3JWgW](https://imgur.com/a/Ux3JWgW)\n\nMy S3 instance served over 270gb of audio files in about 48 hours and Vimeo shows 56,000 views and 120,000 impressions during that same time frame.\n\nHope ya like it and find this bit of info interesting.",

Yes, mining is bad for the environment. But coins only need to be made once. Bills need to be reprinted as old ones wear out. I would like to see a study on the average wear rate for bills versus coins. \n&gt;\n&gt;I think the benefit is that urban environments are more suited for coins via subways, vending machines, etc.\n\nThat argument would be valid if we didn't already have millions of pretty damn well functioning machines and systems in place that accept dollar bills. Most subways and public transit allow you to purchase a pre loaded card so the actual usage is actually _more_ convenient than having to dig through your pocket for a coin each time you ride, you don't insert a bill each time you get on the subway, you just wave your card over the machine (or insert it) and you're on your way. \n\nAnd while this is anecdotal, I've personally had about as much trouble with coins being rejected from vending machines as I have with paper dollars (especially those damn Sparklettes water machines that shoot your dime on the floor lol). So you'd not be solving a real problem here, and it would cost untold millions to retrofit all machines to accept the new coins. \n\nAgain, while I think dollar coins would be fine and work just as well _had they always been the standard_ (despite the \"wasting\" of limited precious metals and harm from mining, which is not insignificant),  \"switching\" the country to this new standard would be incredibly expensive and doesn't solve a single real \"problem\".",

Maybe I will be proven wrong, and the accelerated expansion of access to high speed internet (&amp;quot;accelerated&amp;quot; because obviously it&amp;#39;s coming, either way, via Starlink or continued ground-based expansion, to all inhabited parts of the world) will prove to be such a wondrous thing that it is worth absolutely &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; cost. Then again, more likely, it will continue to be a nebulous thing, hard to quantify, with massively good and also massively terrible consequences for humanity. And that&amp;#39;s ok, I will deal with it (not like I have a choice), but for the time being while it&amp;#39;s still an idea and not a reality, I will also continue to voice my strong opposition to the wholesale destruction of our night sky conducted by any corporation for any purpose.

At the end of the day whether you took the photo with a phone or a high end camera, when you&amp;#39;re at a remote place like this, you&amp;#39;ve done the hardest part which is showing up. It&amp;#39;s always cool to have a photo where you know for a fact no one could have taken the exact same image, because there was no one for miles around to do so!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway congrats on all the love this picture is getting, I&amp;#39;m so glad you shared it.
