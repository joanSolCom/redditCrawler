You'll eventually crash because you overestimate yourself; or,\n2. Someone who is skilled at EQ will use your own emotions against you.",

You don&amp;#39;t do that without understanding how emotions work, and understanding how to use that knowledge to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about his reputation for being mean and manipulative of others? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When he hurt people, it was not because he was lacking in emotional awareness,&amp;quot; writes Jobs&amp;#39;s biographer, Walter Isaacson. &amp;quot;Quite the contrary: he could size people up, understand their inner thoughts, and know how to relate to them, cajole them, or hurt them at will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, even in these areas, Jobs often got what he wanted because he knew how to use other peoples&amp;#39; emotions against them. I like to call it &amp;quot;the dark side&amp;quot; of EQ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EQ is a tool; anyone can use it how they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question, I&amp;#39;m not saying you should care about EQ. Or, maybe you already have high EQ and are using it in ways that are different than I would. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;continuing to be an expert and outsmarting/outwitting [your] peers&amp;quot; while ignoring the role of emotions can lead to one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ll eventually crash because you overestimate yourself; or,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Someone who is skilled at EQ will use your own emotions against you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And thanks for the kind words, krishh--but everything I've got I learned from others.\n\nOk, so here's another one: It's called \"disagree and commit.\"\n\nAs far as I know, the principle of \"disagree and commit\" was created in the 1980s, and popularized by Intel. It's a management principle that encourages healthy discussion and disagreement during the decision-making process, but that requires full support for a decision once made.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos further popularized the principle in a letter he wrote to shareholders:\n\n*This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there's no consensus, it's helpful to say, \"Look, I know we disagree on this, but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?\"* \n\nBezos further explained that to disagree and commit doesn't mean thinking your team is wrong and missing the point. Rather, \"it's a genuine disagreement of opinion, a candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere commitment to go their way.\" \n\nThe beauty of this principle is people might agree to go your way, but they then sabotage the decision by not supporting it or through passive-aggression.\n\nBut if you can do the opposite, if you can show your partner you're willing to go all in, you can strengthen the relationship.\n\nSo, how can you apply this in real life? You can probably think of lots of ways. But here's an experience of mine I once wrote about in Inc. (The following is basically a cut and paste of that story.)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*My family just got back from a wonderful vacation on the Italian coast. It was perfect: 10 days of good food, great sun, and beautiful beaches.*\n\n*One day had the potential to ruin our trip, though.*\n\n*I had caught a bad cold, and I was contemplating staying home. But my wife had her heart set on the beach, and since we have three small children, I came along to help out.*\n\n*I thought we might head to the same beach we went to just a few days earlier. Soft white sand, clear and calm water, and a great bar where we could get food (and rent an umbrella and chairs). But my wife wanted to try a different beach, so I went along with the plan.*\n\n*We arrived, and my wife was in heaven. She loved the turquoise water, which was full of fish and great for snorkeling. The views were amazing. And she even found a little spot under a tree to give us shade.*\n\n*I wasn't as enthusiastic. The shade from the tree was great, but there were no chairs--and it was far from comfortable. The sand wasn't nearly as soft as I like. And the surf was much rougher, which certainly didn't please my 4-year old.* \n\n*As I kept comparing this beach to the other one, my mood deteriorated. I wanted to complain.* \n\n*\"Why couldn't we just have gone back to the other beach,\" I thought.*\n\n*And then I remembered three little words that have saved my relationship time and time again:*\n\n*Disagree and commit.*\n\n*I had agreed to let my wife pick the beach for the day. Sure, I could complain about her choice--but what benefit would that bring? Because of my cold, I would have found something wrong with just about any beach. And complaining would have just made everyone else miserable, too--and undermined my wife at the same time.*\n\n*So, I did the opposite.* \n\n*I looked for all the great things about the beach, and voiced them out loud. \"This water is gorgeous, honey,\" I said. \"We haven't seen this many fish our whole vacation. And the view is really spectacular!\"*\n\n*\"I know,\" she said, excitedly. \"Isn't it great?\"*\n\n*And guess what? I survived those few hours on the beach. I eventually got over my cold, and we enjoyed the rest of our vacation. I even got to go back to the other beach I enjoyed so much.*\n\n*Most important, I avoided what could have quickly snowballed into disaster--had I not remembered those three little words:*\n\n*Disagree and commit.*",

What I mean is, there are tests that can help you identify weaknesses and point you in the right direction of improving your ability to understand and manage emotions, but they’re very imperfect. It's also very difficult to validate and measure EQ because much of it is subjective.\n\n\\-A lot of people misunderstand what emotional intelligence is. (One of the articles you cited is by John Mayer, one of the “founding fathers” of the concept of emotional intelligence as we understand it today—in the article he explains some of these misunderstandings.)\n\n\\-Emotional intelligence isn’t only the “feel-good” stuff. It’s the ability to identify, understand, and manage emotions to reach a goal.
