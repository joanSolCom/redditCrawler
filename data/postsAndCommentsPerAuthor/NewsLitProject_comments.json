Biased in what way(s)? How did the bias manifest itself? How could it have been more impartial? \n\nIn general, I think that bias charts have limited use because our experience of news -- and our perceptions of bias itself -- is so subjective. These charts or ranking systems also feed into a major misperception about news media bias: that it's usually intentional and part of some larger coordinated \"agenda\" at that news outlet. But the vast majority of incidents involving bias in news coverage are 1) highly debatable and 2) the result of blindspots and unintentional lapses in judgment.\n\nCertainly there are overtly biased outlets, but at legitimate, mainstream news organizations there is no coordinated effort to skew or lean coverage one way or the other. (Even this raises questions: what do people really mean when they say an outlet \"leans left\" or has a \"rightward tilt\"? What comprises these leans and tilts, and who decides? More importantly, what counts as the \"center\" and who decides?)\n\nSo helping students dig into this complexity is really key -- because ultimately they have to make these judgments on their own.\n\nWe build an interactive lesson about this subject on Checkology (https://checkology.org/) called \"Understanding Bias\" that we think gives students a great introduction to the subject.",

We hear from teachers all across the country — over and over again, year after year — that integrating news literacy is one of their biggest challenges. \n\nTo help address this, we try to come up with a variety of resources and supports for educators. We try to supply educators with a steady stream of ideas that run the gamut in terms of lift — everything from bell-ringers and journal prompts/discussion questions to activities to lessons to more substantive things like project ideas, suggested units or strategies for integrating throughout the year (news literacy Fridays, for example — or a standing, year-long fact-checking contest). We have a weekly email newsletter for educators called The Sift ([https://newslit.org/educators/sift/](https://newslit.org/educators/sift/)) where we try our best to help meet this challenge, including by linking to classroom-ready slides for quick teachable moments.\n\nYou can also look for touchpoints in your curriculum itself. (Cindy Otis’s new book, *True or False*, is full of historical connections to misinformation, for example.) Finally, however you’re addressing current events in your classroom can easily be optimized to include news literacy as well. \n\nFinally, we’re always listening and always in need of more guidance and input from educators. So if there’s a resource teachers feel they need that doesn’t exist yet, we'd love to know so we can add it to our list.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Peter. You’ve asked a question that my team and I ask ourselves more or less constantly. We hear from teachers all across the country — over and over again, year after year — that integrating news literacy is one of their biggest challenges. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help address this, we try to come up with a variety of resources and supports for educators. We try to supply educators with a steady stream of ideas that run the gamut in terms of lift — everything from bell-ringers and journal prompts/discussion questions to activities to lessons to more substantive things like project ideas, suggested units or strategies for integrating throughout the year (news literacy Fridays, for example — or a standing, year-long fact-checking contest). We have a weekly email newsletter for educators called The Sift (&lt;a href=\"https://newslit.org/educators/sift/\"&gt;https://newslit.org/educators/sift/&lt;/a&gt;) where we try our best to help meet this challenge, including by linking to classroom-ready slides for quick teachable moments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also look for touchpoints in your curriculum itself. (Cindy Otis’s new book, &lt;em&gt;True or False&lt;/em&gt;, is full of historical connections to misinformation, for example.) Finally, however you’re addressing current events in your classroom can easily be optimized to include news literacy as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re always listening and always in need of more guidance and input from educators. So if there’s a resource teachers feel they need that doesn’t exist yet, we&amp;#39;d love to know so we can add it to our list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It also became a buzzword, so lots of media organizations started using it in headlines in ways that referred to just about any kind of false information — including memes and evidence-free assertions on social media.

The differences between distinct types of misinformation, the tactics and motivations of purveyors of falsehoods, and questions about impact all become opaque as soon as they’re lumped together this way. And when the term is used to refer to errors or other problems in standards-based news reports, it’s even more troubling and damaging.\n\nSo we favor using the term “misinformation” to refer to any kind of false information, and “disinformation” to refer to that subset of misinformation that is intentional (and largely tactical).

I try to set up a space at my desk and sort of say, “OK I’m going to do this work now and when I’m done with this work, I’ll get up and take a walk or be in a safe space with my family or do something else that feels good.” \n\nI definitely feel that online IS IRL and should be treated seriously, but it’s not MY life.

I’ve been talking to people who have lost their moms to QAnon rabbit holes and I cry with them. Last night I was investigating the repurposed child abuse photos that conspiracy theorists use to market their grifts and I cried. The mass shootings last summer that were livestreamed? I watched and sobbed for days. So it definitely gets to me. But I think it’s all about compartmentalizing The Stuff. After I covered the New Zealand mosque shooting last year I realized that I have to keep this stuff separate or I was gonna go insane. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I don’t scroll through the bad parts of the internet — white power websites or QAnon boards, anti-vaxx blogs, or whatever — when I’m with my kids. I try to set up a space at my desk and sort of say, “OK I’m going to do this work now and when I’m done with this work, I’ll get up and take a walk or be in a safe space with my family or do something else that feels good.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I definitely feel that online IS IRL and should be treated seriously, but it’s not MY life. I have to remember that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
