The typists of the early 20th century used to stress \"perfect rhythm\" as essential for typing, by which they seemed to mean typing all words at the same rate of speed.  This does not make sense to me, as some letters/parts of the keyboard/words are easier than others.  You can't type all words at the same rate of speed, so if there's a game that attempts to train you to do that, effectively it's training you to type every character as slowly as you type the slowest character.  That can be a good way of practicing accuracy, but not practicing speed.  I think the 1920s and 1930s typists were actually doing that because William F. Oswald, the 1919 champion, managed to make only one typo over an entire hour in the 1921 international typing championship (although he lost that year because other typists were faster.)  It seems like back then, typists did really slow themselves down rather than typing easier words more quickly and that may be why they got accuracy rates of 1 typo or fewer per minute, which seems astounding today (even Aaron Adams, the greatest accuracy typist today, tells me he doesn't think he can do that.)  In the age of backspace, however, I don't think this matters so much anymore so the top typists these days are all faster and less accurate than the typists of days of yore.\n\ntl;dr: I might recommend a rhythm game for someone who really struggles on accuracy, but I don't think it'll do anything to help your speed.",

        "body": "I never really identified as a gamer, and it's been a long time since I played anything other than Scrabble or typing games, but that's not to say I haven't played lots of games.  I played a couple racing games when I was a kid in the '90s, Papyrus NASCAR Racing 2 and an Al Unser, Jr.-licensed IndyCar game.  I played tons of racing fantasy games and invented a couple of my own in 1999-2000, one of which still exists almost 20 years after I stopped running it.  I didn't like graphical/visual games much and preferred text-based games.  I played '80s DOS versions of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! often along with educational games like PC Atlas and PC USA.  My favorite obscurity was this text-based adventure called Big Rig where you drove a truck hauling produce cross-country and as I recall you usually died in a crash due to sleep deprivation.  I enjoyed the text-based adventure game for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy too.\n\nAs far as conventional/mainstream video games, they were usually too violent for me.  I didn't like shooting things or anything like that so I wasn't into Doom or whatever even though many of my classmates were.  The only two shooting games I ever did like were Wizard of Wor and (like most of the people in my age demographic) The Oregon Trail.  I also liked Jumpman, which either ripped off Donkey Kong or vice versa (I don't remember which came first), and I enjoyed Tetris and its other knockoffs Welltris and Faces.  So yeah, I played a bunch of things but I didn't really consider any of those one of my biggest hobbies or something.\n\nI was I guess more of a nerd than a geek as I was way more into academic competitions: spelling bees, math league meets, and yeah, I guess Scrabble and typing sort of combine both of those skills in a weird way.\n\nScrabble was always my biggest gaming interest.  I joined the Mensa Scrabble-by-Mail SIG when I was eight years old and was the youngest player in the history of the group.  I was never a Mensa member but both of my parents were and my mom was one of the top players in that group for a while (she at one time had the second highest game score in the history of the group with a 718.)  I never had interest in joining Mensa per se because IQ boasting is obnoxious and annoying, but I did really want to join the Scrabble group.  I used to open my mom's games in the mail and the newsletters when I was like eight or something and tried to find plays on her games.  When I once found a better play than she did, she got annoyed and asked me if I wanted to play my own and I said yes.  I broke the youngest player record of Robert Slaven, a future five-time Jeopardy! champion, who joined the group when he was twelve (weirdly, his first game was against my mom in the '70s.)  Later on in high school, I became the statistician of the group and did a 20-page statistical column every other month, greatly expanding upon the previous statistical columns.  Besides Slaven and I, there were several other niche nerd celebrities in the group, including Chuck Armstrong (who won more Scrabble tournaments than any other player and only played one game in the group, set the all-time highest game score and never played again), Peter Morris (the first World Scrabble Champion), Doug Hoylman (the first person to win the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament six times), and Bob Lipton (who finished 3rd in the national and world Scrabble championships in the mid-'90s.)  It was very different from tournament play as the top players all used word-finder references but it probably helped my strategic ability.  Although I was a top ten player in the Mensa group by the time I graduated high school, it took me considerably longer to make connections to the actual tournament scene and as a result there are tons of younger players who are better than I am now.  But as with typing, it doesn't really excite me as much as it once did.  But yeah, I guess I was more of a gamer than a lot of people, but I have to say I enjoyed more academic or pseudo-intellectual games more than what would be considered conventional video games.",

I played tons of racing fantasy games and invented a couple of my own in 1999-2000, one of which still exists almost 20 years after I stopped running it.  I didn&amp;#39;t like graphical/visual games much and preferred text-based games.  I played &amp;#39;80s DOS versions of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! often along with educational games like PC Atlas and PC USA.  My favorite obscurity was this text-based adventure called Big Rig where you drove a truck hauling produce cross-country and as I recall you usually died in a crash due to sleep deprivation.  I enjoyed the text-based adventure game for the Hitchhiker&amp;#39;s Guide to the Galaxy too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as conventional/mainstream video games, they were usually too violent for me.  I didn&amp;#39;t like shooting things or anything like that so I wasn&amp;#39;t into Doom or whatever even though many of my classmates were.  The only two shooting games I ever did like were Wizard of Wor and (like most of the people in my age demographic) The Oregon Trail.  I also liked Jumpman, which either ripped off Donkey Kong or vice versa (I don&amp;#39;t remember which came first), and I enjoyed Tetris and its other knockoffs Welltris and Faces.  So yeah, I played a bunch of things but I didn&amp;#39;t really consider any of those one of my biggest hobbies or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was I guess more of a nerd than a geek as I was way more into academic competitions: spelling bees, math league meets, and yeah, I guess Scrabble and typing sort of combine both of those skills in a weird way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scrabble was always my biggest gaming interest.  I joined the Mensa Scrabble-by-Mail SIG when I was eight years old and was the youngest player in the history of the group.  I was never a Mensa member but both of my parents were and my mom was one of the top players in that group for a while (she at one time had the second highest game score in the history of the group with a 718.)  I never had interest in joining Mensa per se because IQ boasting is obnoxious and annoying, but I did really want to join the Scrabble group.  I used to open my mom&amp;#39;s games in the mail and the newsletters when I was like eight or something and tried to find plays on her games.  When I once found a better play than she did, she got annoyed and asked me if I wanted to play my own and I said yes.  I broke the youngest player record of Robert Slaven, a future five-time Jeopardy! champion, who joined the group when he was twelve (weirdly, his first game was against my mom in the &amp;#39;70s.)  Later on in high school, I became the statistician of the group and did a 20-page statistical column every other month, greatly expanding upon the previous statistical columns.  Besides Slaven and I, there were several other niche nerd celebrities in the group, including Chuck Armstrong (who won more Scrabble tournaments than any other player and only played one game in the group, set the all-time highest game score and never played again), Peter Morris (the first World Scrabble Champion), Doug Hoylman (the first person to win the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament six times), and Bob Lipton (who finished 3rd in the national and world Scrabble championships in the mid-&amp;#39;90s.)  It was very different from tournament play as the top players all used word-finder references but it probably helped my strategic ability.  Although I was a top ten player in the Mensa group by the time I graduated high school, it took me considerably longer to make connections to the actual tournament scene and as a result there are tons of younger players who are better than I am now.  But as with typing, it doesn&amp;#39;t really excite me as much as it once did.  But yeah, I guess I was more of a gamer than a lot of people, but I have to say I enjoyed more academic or pseudo-intellectual games more than what would be considered conventional video games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

A lot of people assume that the most frequent words are the easiest to type, but that really isn't the case.  Generally, more frequent words are faster than slower ones.

The most frequent word in the English language is the, but it is only 287th fastest out of 3519 words on QWERTY, which means if you are typing it expecting it to be the fastest word because of its frequency, you'll get errors a lot.  There's a reason the typo \"teh\" became a famous Internet meme.\n\nFor one of the later chapters of my book, I calculated the fastest and slowest words for each typist I included in my study by taking the average of the difference between each typist's overall average time in milliseconds and the average time in milliseconds it took to type that word.\n\nFor QWERTY typists the 50 fastest words that occurred frequently enough are these:\n\npower spite life host talk tank real nose more notes ones list moves\nnations mouse lines most sail fail hear lives past going things live\nthose admire rain move walk poet have peak person songs learn wings last something respond lies meal hate slings shoes warn times sometimes poets while\n\nGenerally, these are either words that do not force you to repeat letters or words that do not require you to move your fingers (even though sometimes repeats three sets of letters, you don't actually have to move your fingers from the s, e, or m while typing it.)

My guess is you probably type extremely common words like a, the, and of faster than you should be, and words like this not fast enough.\n\nThe slowest 50 words by the way were:\n\nI worldly scratch I'll exact oh plutonium jolly betrayed jump wizard escaped rhythm deeds initial eleven faded dictated defy I'm essence artificial succeed coffee craft sacred scattered sweetness devastating philosophy sweet expect ship's exactly extent occurred gazed acted tax severe freeze ceases unnecessary swept fixed forced defense sweetest regarded elected\n\nThis may give you an idea what kinds of words you should speed up and what kinds of words you should slow down on.  Personally, I think one of the keys to typing is maximizing your speed on the fast words and minimizing your speed on the slow words to such a degree that you are equally likely to make a typo on every word.  That is probably the best compromise between speed and accuracy.\n\nI included no words with capital letters except for I, I'd, I'll, I'm, and I've because those are the only non-proper name words do not have a lowercase form, and I included words that had apostrophes and hyphens in the middle of the word, but removed all words with any other kind of punctuation or capitalization, because naturally people will be slower on capitals and punctuation than they are on lowercase letters.",

My guess is you probably type extremely common words like a, the, and of faster than you should be, and words like this not fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The slowest 50 words by the way were:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worldly scratch I&amp;#39;ll exact oh plutonium jolly betrayed jump wizard escaped rhythm deeds initial eleven faded dictated defy I&amp;#39;m essence artificial succeed coffee craft sacred scattered sweetness devastating philosophy sweet expect ship&amp;#39;s exactly extent occurred gazed acted tax severe freeze ceases unnecessary swept fixed forced defense sweetest regarded elected&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may give you an idea what kinds of words you should speed up and what kinds of words you should slow down on.  Personally, I think one of the keys to typing is maximizing your speed on the fast words and minimizing your speed on the slow words to such a degree that you are equally likely to make a typo on every word.  That is probably the best compromise between speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I included no words with capital letters except for I, I&amp;#39;d, I&amp;#39;ll, I&amp;#39;m, and I&amp;#39;ve because those are the only non-proper name words do not have a lowercase form, and I included words that had apostrophes and hyphens in the middle of the word, but removed all words with any other kind of punctuation or capitalization, because naturally people will be slower on capitals and punctuation than they are on lowercase letters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I don't think you necessarily need to use every finger, but I personally do think you need to use both index fingers, middle fingers, and ring fingers to type letters.  Maybe you can live without using your pinkies and thumbs for letters, although I think even they can help.  Most QWERTY typists are slowest on the letter x because it has numerous obstructions from more important letters (a, c, d, e, r, and s.)  One way you can be faster on very slow letters like the x and c could be to use your left thumb.  Alpha Panda does that and he's actually very fast on x, which most of the rest of us aren't, so probably using your thumbs for letters could help, but most of us don't do it.  I don't think you actually need to use every finger, but the more fingers you do, the more it probably helps.",

Most of us actually use nine fingers and don&amp;#39;t use one of our thumbs.  I don&amp;#39;t think you necessarily need to use every finger, but I personally do think you need to use both index fingers, middle fingers, and ring fingers to type letters.  Maybe you can live without using your pinkies and thumbs for letters, although I think even they can help.  Most QWERTY typists are slowest on the letter x because it has numerous obstructions from more important letters (a, c, d, e, r, and s.)  One way you can be faster on very slow letters like the x and c could be to use your left thumb.  Alpha Panda does that and he&amp;#39;s actually very fast on x, which most of the rest of us aren&amp;#39;t, so probably using your thumbs for letters could help, but most of us don&amp;#39;t do it.  I don&amp;#39;t think you actually need to use every finger, but the more fingers you do, the more it probably helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So yeah, the closer you have to an everyday text, the better it will serve as efficient practice in my opinion.  That&amp;#39;s why TypeRacer and Nitro Type are both better for that than something like 10FastFingers is IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Other layouts are definitely faster than QWERTY on the home row, so if you do prefer QWERTY, you'd be better off focusing on where the most frequently used letters are than what letters just HAPPEN to be on the home row.\n\nThe home row letters are only where they were because the home row was originally based on the first half of the alphabet.\n\nThe original layout for QWERTY was simply this:\n\nABCDEFGHIJKLM\n\nZYXWVUTSRQPON\n\nThe first half of the alphabet, followed by the second half backwards.  You can still see this on the home row today, as DFGHJKL are 7 consecutive consonants.  The vowels and semi-vowels (W, Y) were moved to the top row later intentionally along with several other consonants and the S was moved based on the recommendations of some telegraph operators in the 1800s, at which point the B and C were moved down.  But yeah, the bottom two rows of the QWERTY keyboard are basically the alphabet.  So I find it utterly bizarre given that knowledge that people are still trained to do typing drills focused on the home row when the top row is where the only thought was done on the original QWERTY layout.  QWERTY predated the home row method, so using home row on QWERTY will certainly be inefficient when compared to using it on Dvorak and Colemak.",

        "body": "The first question that comes to my mind here is whether this is a Bodine thing or a Hendrick thing generally, because although I knew that Bodine was a much better qualifier than finisher, I knew that was true to an even more extreme degree in Ken Schrader's case.\n\nLooking it up, Tim Richmond had an average start of 4.7 and an average finish of 9.9 in 1986, with 8 poles to 7 wins.\n\nSchrader had 17 poles to 4 wins, and had a higher average start than average finish all but one year.\n\nWaltrip had many more wins than poles, but still had a higher average start in two seasons including the blockbuster 1989.\n\nI would say for most top drivers average starts are going to invariably be higher, because top drivers simply qualify more consistently than they finish. Qualifying is a one-lap speed and a single lap is less likely to be ruined by bad luck than a race containing hundreds of laps.\n\nSo all this is really saying is that Hendrick generally was much stronger in qualifying than in the races until Jeff Gordon arrived, which is no surprise, and actually Waltrip's late '80s bucked that trend a little.\n\nI really think average finish is more luck than skill. Do I think Bill Elliott's 1988 was better than his 1985, championship or not? No. He just had fewer unlucky races. Same for Bobby Labonte's 2000 vs. his 1999 or Dale Jarrett's '99 vs. his '97. In all three cases I believe the non-championship season was superior, but just unluckier.\n\nI think drivers play more of a role in their dominance than in their consistency, so I would tend to rate a dominant but inconsistent driver over a consistent, never-dominant one, which is in Bodine's favor. Although certainly he wasn't championship caliber. But I believe the peak finishes matter more and the subpar finishes (based on average finish and NASCAR's points systems) matter more than they should. The value between a 2nd and 3rd place finish should be much more than the value between a 42nd and 43rd place finish. Finish distributions should be weighted towards the higher positions, which would make your Bodines and Irvans look better. I do think both of them are hall of famers with Irvan being the stronger case, but while this is the second-strongest counterargument for Bodine (the strongest argument is easily his lackluster record vs. his teammates in 1986-89 and 1991), I think Bodine has several things in his favor that are undervalued.\n\nI think you're also wrong to assume that just because a team dominates in qualifying that they are the best team. Penske had lots of seasons in the late '90s/2000s with Wallace, Newman, and even Mayfield when they were dominating in qualifying and were they even remotely close to the best team? The same deal with Hendrick. \nWaltrip certainly did not come close to matching his Junior Johnson results while at Hendrick, so I don't think you can argue they were ever the best team pre-Jeff Gordon except for MAYBE 1986 and 1989.\n\nI think the short tracks and the road courses are where the driver has more impact and where you are most likely to overcome a horsepower disadvantage, and that is where drivers like Bodine, Rudd, Irvan, Gant, Richmond thrived which is why I like them more than superspeedway specialists like Baker, B. Labonte, and the like (who I think should be in too, as I have much lower standards than you do clearly.) Although I would certainly take Bodine last of those five. Bodine was one of only three to win on all three of the long-lasting road courses along with Rudd and Wallace, but that's admittedly sort of a quirk since not a whole lot of drivers competed on all three of them in their prime.\n\nPlus it's the NASCAR HoF, not the Cup HoF and I think that Bodine was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for years for most wins in a season with 45 NASCAR modified wins and that should really push him over the line if modified results are given as much weight as they are. I think he also did play a role in broadening NASCAR's geographic base outside the southeast, not to mention that he made certain innovations popular (isn't he credited with introducing power steering and closed-face helmets, and sadly, being the first driver to always without fail mention his sponsors in every interview, sort of starting the corporate NASCAR trend?) I also think he did a really nice job for the Bud Moore and self-owned teams in '93-'94 when I don't think those teams were as good as he was making them look. Yeah, sure, all the Hoosier drivers were qualifying up front in '94, but Bodine was the only one who was staying up there, apart from that one Pocono race, and I guess that Rockingham race Mast dominated. I also think Bodine's IROC title proves something. Although not technically NASCAR, it might as well have been by that era and should give him more cred.\n\nYes, he finished worse than he started, but I think you'll find that with most top drivers who qualified well simply because it's a lot easier to be consistent in qualifying. Yes, he was drastically outperformed by most teammates. But if you look at other arguments, I think he's HoF. If you think somebody like Benny Parsons or Carl Edwards should be the absolute lower limit, I agree he's not. But I'd go down to like Sterling Marlin and I know you'd find that ridiculous because we've talked about that on Twitter before.\n\nI'd say a top 50 driver. I think you way overestimate qualifying results in determining the strength of teams. I don't think anyone would say Ryan Newman had the best equipment most of those years, and I wouldn't throw Bodine in the Newman pile but you seem to be doing so.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first question that comes to my mind here is whether this is a Bodine thing or a Hendrick thing generally, because although I knew that Bodine was a much better qualifier than finisher, I knew that was true to an even more extreme degree in Ken Schrader&amp;#39;s case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking it up, Tim Richmond had an average start of 4.7 and an average finish of 9.9 in 1986, with 8 poles to 7 wins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schrader had 17 poles to 4 wins, and had a higher average start than average finish all but one year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waltrip had many more wins than poles, but still had a higher average start in two seasons including the blockbuster 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say for most top drivers average starts are going to invariably be higher, because top drivers simply qualify more consistently than they finish. Qualifying is a one-lap speed and a single lap is less likely to be ruined by bad luck than a race containing hundreds of laps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all this is really saying is that Hendrick generally was much stronger in qualifying than in the races until Jeff Gordon arrived, which is no surprise, and actually Waltrip&amp;#39;s late &amp;#39;80s bucked that trend a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really think average finish is more luck than skill. Do I think Bill Elliott&amp;#39;s 1988 was better than his 1985, championship or not? No. He just had fewer unlucky races. Same for Bobby Labonte&amp;#39;s 2000 vs. his 1999 or Dale Jarrett&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;99 vs. his &amp;#39;97. In all three cases I believe the non-championship season was superior, but just unluckier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think drivers play more of a role in their dominance than in their consistency, so I would tend to rate a dominant but inconsistent driver over a consistent, never-dominant one, which is in Bodine&amp;#39;s favor. Although certainly he wasn&amp;#39;t championship caliber. But I believe the peak finishes matter more and the subpar finishes (based on average finish and NASCAR&amp;#39;s points systems) matter more than they should. The value between a 2nd and 3rd place finish should be much more than the value between a 42nd and 43rd place finish. Finish distributions should be weighted towards the higher positions, which would make your Bodines and Irvans look better. I do think both of them are hall of famers with Irvan being the stronger case, but while this is the second-strongest counterargument for Bodine (the strongest argument is easily his lackluster record vs. his teammates in 1986-89 and 1991), I think Bodine has several things in his favor that are undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re also wrong to assume that just because a team dominates in qualifying that they are the best team. Penske had lots of seasons in the late &amp;#39;90s/2000s with Wallace, Newman, and even Mayfield when they were dominating in qualifying and were they even remotely close to the best team? The same deal with Hendrick. \nWaltrip certainly did not come close to matching his Junior Johnson results while at Hendrick, so I don&amp;#39;t think you can argue they were ever the best team pre-Jeff Gordon except for MAYBE 1986 and 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the short tracks and the road courses are where the driver has more impact and where you are most likely to overcome a horsepower disadvantage, and that is where drivers like Bodine, Rudd, Irvan, Gant, Richmond thrived which is why I like them more than superspeedway specialists like Baker, B. Labonte, and the like (who I think should be in too, as I have much lower standards than you do clearly.) Although I would certainly take Bodine last of those five. Bodine was one of only three to win on all three of the long-lasting road courses along with Rudd and Wallace, but that&amp;#39;s admittedly sort of a quirk since not a whole lot of drivers competed on all three of them in their prime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus it&amp;#39;s the NASCAR HoF, not the Cup HoF and I think that Bodine was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for years for most wins in a season with 45 NASCAR modified wins and that should really push him over the line if modified results are given as much weight as they are. I think he also did play a role in broadening NASCAR&amp;#39;s geographic base outside the southeast, not to mention that he made certain innovations popular (isn&amp;#39;t he credited with introducing power steering and closed-face helmets, and sadly, being the first driver to always without fail mention his sponsors in every interview, sort of starting the corporate NASCAR trend?) I also think he did a really nice job for the Bud Moore and self-owned teams in &amp;#39;93-&amp;#39;94 when I don&amp;#39;t think those teams were as good as he was making them look. Yeah, sure, all the Hoosier drivers were qualifying up front in &amp;#39;94, but Bodine was the only one who was staying up there, apart from that one Pocono race, and I guess that Rockingham race Mast dominated. I also think Bodine&amp;#39;s IROC title proves something. Although not technically NASCAR, it might as well have been by that era and should give him more cred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, he finished worse than he started, but I think you&amp;#39;ll find that with most top drivers who qualified well simply because it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to be consistent in qualifying. Yes, he was drastically outperformed by most teammates. But if you look at other arguments, I think he&amp;#39;s HoF. If you think somebody like Benny Parsons or Carl Edwards should be the absolute lower limit, I agree he&amp;#39;s not. But I&amp;#39;d go down to like Sterling Marlin and I know you&amp;#39;d find that ridiculous because we&amp;#39;ve talked about that on Twitter before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say a top 50 driver. I think you way overestimate qualifying results in determining the strength of teams. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone would say Ryan Newman had the best equipment most of those years, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t throw Bodine in the Newman pile but you seem to be doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Until the past few years, especially last year, the drivers on the first list usually overachieved relative to their Xfinity results while the drivers on the second list usually underachieved in Cup, relative to their minor-league dominance.  I think the reason for the distinction is that Cup cars had much higher horsepower in past years and that really did make other forms of racing like sprint cars which had higher horsepower than minor-league NASCAR did better practice for higher horsepower Cup cars, but now the Cup cars are not higher horsepower and this is continuing for 2016, so I would continue to expect sprint car drivers to struggle (and Larson and Stenhouse haven't been that great out of the gate) while the drivers who have been in stock cars from day one will continue to dominate.  The reduced horsepower has now pretty much shut down the odds of sprint car drivers emerging into superstars and prevented them from having any chance of major-league success, after they were already essentially shut out of IndyCar when first in the '70s USAC banned rear-engine sprint cars and then later CART moved to a mostly road-course schedule (admittedly, given Gordon and Stewart's success on road courses despite their initial relative lack of experience on them, I definitely think it's short-sighted to assume that USAC drivers COULDN'T adapt to road course racing).  I understand why Tony George felt the IRL was a necessary move, but if he was going to do that, continuing to use formula cars (albeit cheaper ones) rather than coming up with some modernized roadster meant it would inevitably fail, as he was not going to find very many drivers (okay fine, Kenny Brack and Tony Stewart, but Stewart's open wheel career is very overrated) without CART experience who would be better than CART drivers at FORMULA racing...  Not to mention that every one of the IRL drivers who were actually good (except for Stewart) were road racing veterans as well.  Brack, Wheldon, Rice, and Hornish are still the only post-split Indy 500 winners without CART experience, and the last three were all graduates of CART's feeder series anyway...  If NASCAR wants to remain open to sprint car drivers (and Gordon and Stewart have certainly been major contributors to the last 25 years of NASCAR) the reduced horsepower is a bad idea.  However, the late model veterans now dominating must be salivating at the prospect of this continuing.\n\nBut...I could be wrong.",

There are certain situations you want to defer a bingo, often if the game is close and you're trying to force your opponent to take the last tile so that you can go out first and collect the tiles on your opponent's rack, but not to avoid opening triple lines.  Sometimes if you have a blank and all your bingos are low-scoring you will want to wait (or if you have high-scoring non-bingo plays that don't use the blank and don't score MUCH less than your highest-scoring bingos do), but even that's hugely risky.  Obviously if you have a big lead, you will want to choose a more defensive bingo that doesn't open the board/keeps the board closed, but it's more about not allowing your opponent to score a bingo in response than about opening up triple lines.

There are certain situations you want to defer a bingo, often if the game is close and you&amp;#39;re trying to force your opponent to take the last tile so that you can go out first and collect the tiles on your opponent&amp;#39;s rack, but not to avoid opening triple lines.  Sometimes if you have a blank and all your bingos are low-scoring you will want to wait (or if you have high-scoring non-bingo plays that don&amp;#39;t use the blank and don&amp;#39;t score MUCH less than your highest-scoring bingos do), but even that&amp;#39;s hugely risky.  Obviously if you have a big lead, you will want to choose a more defensive bingo that doesn&amp;#39;t open the board/keeps the board closed, but it&amp;#39;s more about not allowing your opponent to score a bingo in response than about opening up triple lines.  Triple lines aren&amp;#39;t as big of a threat in tournaments as casual players think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The only people who might want to use it now would be recreational players who would probably rather end up using the TWL (if they were hardcore) or a collegiate dictionary with fewer weird words in it.  Not sure what the current OSPD niche would be.  Players not interested in tournaments who want an expansive dictionary but don&amp;#39;t want to use swear words or brand names (many of which are also removed from OSPD)?  I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s very many people.  Really it&amp;#39;s just TWL and Collins in North America, Collins alone internationally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There was a leaderboard listing the top 20 scores and the top 6 people who responded to their email and ruled eligible competed in the semifinals.  You had to be 18 years of age or older at the time and born in the US to qualify.  Jelani Nelson posted the fastest speed barely over me and although he was an MIT grad student and living in Massachusetts entirely, he was initially ruled ineligible because he was a U.S. Virgin Islands native.

        "body": "The idea of rhythm is a confusing one.  The typists of the early 20th century used to stress \"perfect rhythm\" as essential for typing, by which they seemed to mean typing all words at the same rate of speed.  This does not make sense to me, as some letters/parts of the keyboard/words are easier than others.  You can't type all words at the same rate of speed, so if there's a game that attempts to train you to do that, effectively it's training you to type every character as slowly as you type the slowest character.  That can be a good way of practicing accuracy, but not practicing speed.  I think the 1920s and 1930s typists were actually doing that because William F. Oswald, the 1919 champion, managed to make only one typo over an entire hour in the 1921 international typing championship (although he lost that year because other typists were faster.)  It seems like back then, typists did really slow themselves down rather than typing easier words more quickly and that may be why they got accuracy rates of 1 typo or fewer per minute, which seems astounding today (even Aaron Adams, the greatest accuracy typist today, tells me he doesn't think he can do that.)  In the age of backspace, however, I don't think this matters so much anymore so the top typists these days are all faster and less accurate than the typists of days of yore.\n\ntl;dr: I might recommend a rhythm game for someone who really struggles on accuracy, but I don't think it'll do anything to help your speed.",

        "body": "I never really identified as a gamer, and it's been a long time since I played anything other than Scrabble or typing games, but that's not to say I haven't played lots of games.  I played a couple racing games when I was a kid in the '90s, Papyrus NASCAR Racing 2 and an Al Unser, Jr.-licensed IndyCar game.  I played tons of racing fantasy games and invented a couple of my own in 1999-2000, one of which still exists almost 20 years after I stopped running it.  I didn't like graphical/visual games much and preferred text-based games.  I played '80s DOS versions of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! often along with educational games like PC Atlas and PC USA.  My favorite obscurity was this text-based adventure called Big Rig where you drove a truck hauling produce cross-country and as I recall you usually died in a crash due to sleep deprivation.  I enjoyed the text-based adventure game for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy too.\n\nAs far as conventional/mainstream video games, they were usually too violent for me.  I didn't like shooting things or anything like that so I wasn't into Doom or whatever even though many of my classmates were.  The only two shooting games I ever did like were Wizard of Wor and (like most of the people in my age demographic) The Oregon Trail.  I also liked Jumpman, which either ripped off Donkey Kong or vice versa (I don't remember which came first), and I enjoyed Tetris and its other knockoffs Welltris and Faces.  So yeah, I played a bunch of things but I didn't really consider any of those one of my biggest hobbies or something.\n\nI was I guess more of a nerd than a geek as I was way more into academic competitions: spelling bees, math league meets, and yeah, I guess Scrabble and typing sort of combine both of those skills in a weird way.\n\nScrabble was always my biggest gaming interest.  I joined the Mensa Scrabble-by-Mail SIG when I was eight years old and was the youngest player in the history of the group.  I was never a Mensa member but both of my parents were and my mom was one of the top players in that group for a while (she at one time had the second highest game score in the history of the group with a 718.)  I never had interest in joining Mensa per se because IQ boasting is obnoxious and annoying, but I did really want to join the Scrabble group.  I used to open my mom's games in the mail and the newsletters when I was like eight or something and tried to find plays on her games.  When I once found a better play than she did, she got annoyed and asked me if I wanted to play my own and I said yes.  I broke the youngest player record of Robert Slaven, a future five-time Jeopardy! champion, who joined the group when he was twelve (weirdly, his first game was against my mom in the '70s.)  Later on in high school, I became the statistician of the group and did a 20-page statistical column every other month, greatly expanding upon the previous statistical columns.  Besides Slaven and I, there were several other niche nerd celebrities in the group, including Chuck Armstrong (who won more Scrabble tournaments than any other player and only played one game in the group, set the all-time highest game score and never played again), Peter Morris (the first World Scrabble Champion), Doug Hoylman (the first person to win the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament six times), and Bob Lipton (who finished 3rd in the national and world Scrabble championships in the mid-'90s.)  It was very different from tournament play as the top players all used word-finder references but it probably helped my strategic ability.  Although I was a top ten player in the Mensa group by the time I graduated high school, it took me considerably longer to make connections to the actual tournament scene and as a result there are tons of younger players who are better than I am now.  But as with typing, it doesn't really excite me as much as it once did.  But yeah, I guess I was more of a gamer than a lot of people, but I have to say I enjoyed more academic or pseudo-intellectual games more than what would be considered conventional video games.",

I used to open my mom&amp;#39;s games in the mail and the newsletters when I was like eight or something and tried to find plays on her games.  When I once found a better play than she did, she got annoyed and asked me if I wanted to play my own and I said yes.  I broke the youngest player record of Robert Slaven, a future five-time Jeopardy! champion, who joined the group when he was twelve (weirdly, his first game was against my mom in the &amp;#39;70s.)  Later on in high school, I became the statistician of the group and did a 20-page statistical column every other month, greatly expanding upon the previous statistical columns.  Besides Slaven and I, there were several other niche nerd celebrities in the group, including Chuck Armstrong (who won more Scrabble tournaments than any other player and only played one game in the group, set the all-time highest game score and never played again), Peter Morris (the first World Scrabble Champion), Doug Hoylman (the first person to win the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament six times), and Bob Lipton (who finished 3rd in the national and world Scrabble championships in the mid-&amp;#39;90s.)  It was very different from tournament play as the top players all used word-finder references but it probably helped my strategic ability.  Although I was a top ten player in the Mensa group by the time I graduated high school, it took me considerably longer to make connections to the actual tournament scene and as a result there are tons of younger players who are better than I am now.  But as with typing, it doesn&amp;#39;t really excite me as much as it once did.  But yeah, I guess I was more of a gamer than a lot of people, but I have to say I enjoyed more academic or pseudo-intellectual games more than what would be considered conventional video games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "I was just as into that as typing.  I used to spend hours on end as a 3 or 4 year old messing around with my mom's scientific calculator and memorizing all the values for each function for the numbers 0 and 1, and I memorized all the powers of 2 from 2 to 67,108,664 and stuff like that.  I discovered on my own that the differences between square numbers consistently increases by the next odd number, like so:\n\n1\n1+3=4\n1+3+5=9\n1+3+5+7=16\netc...\n\nI figured out that you could take square numbers more quickly if you added and subtracted by the same number and then added the square of the difference.  For example, to calculate 98 squared:\n\n98^2 = (96*100)+4 = 9604\n\nSome of these things I discovered by myself; others I think I picked up from pop math books like Mathemagics by Arthur Benjamin and Michael Shermer.

I used to spend hours on end as a 3 or 4 year old messing around with my mom&amp;#39;s scientific calculator and memorizing all the values for each function for the numbers 0 and 1, and I memorized all the powers of 2 from 2 to 67,108,664 and stuff like that.  I discovered on my own that the differences between square numbers consistently increases by the next odd number, like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1\n1+3=4\n1+3+5=9\n1+3+5+7=16\netc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured out that you could take square numbers more quickly if you added and subtracted by the same number and then added the square of the difference.  For example, to calculate 98 squared:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;98&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (96*100)+4 = 9604&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of these things I discovered by myself; others I think I picked up from pop math books like Mathemagics by Arthur Benjamin and Michael Shermer.

I don't enjoy it as much as I did in 2011 or 2012, but when I type, I usually do a half hour a day, which for me is 50 consecutive races on TypeRacer in the main universe.  I have only ever used QWERTY, but I don't particularly follow the home row method because I put substantially more emphasis on placing my fingers around the most frequently used letters than a lot of typists do.  Other layouts are definitely faster than QWERTY on the home row, so if you do prefer QWERTY, you'd be better off focusing on where the most frequently used letters are than what letters just HAPPEN to be on the home row.\n\nThe home row letters are only where they were because the home row was originally based on the first half of the alphabet.\n\nThe original layout for QWERTY was simply this:\n\nABCDEFGHIJKLM\n\nZYXWVUTSRQPON\n\nThe first half of the alphabet, followed by the second half backwards.  You can still see this on the home row today, as DFGHJKL are 7 consecutive consonants.  The vowels and semi-vowels (W, Y) were moved to the top row later intentionally along with several other consonants and the S was moved based on the recommendations of some telegraph operators in the 1800s, at which point the B and C were moved down.  But yeah, the bottom two rows of the QWERTY keyboard are basically the alphabet.  So I find it utterly bizarre given that knowledge that people are still trained to do typing drills focused on the home row when the top row is where the only thought was done on the original QWERTY layout.  QWERTY predated the home row method, so using home row on QWERTY will certainly be inefficient when compared to using it on Dvorak and Colemak.",

I have only ever used QWERTY, but I don&amp;#39;t particularly follow the home row method because I put substantially more emphasis on placing my fingers around the most frequently used letters than a lot of typists do.  Other layouts are definitely faster than QWERTY on the home row, so if you do prefer QWERTY, you&amp;#39;d be better off focusing on where the most frequently used letters are than what letters just HAPPEN to be on the home row.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The home row letters are only where they were because the home row was originally based on the first half of the alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original layout for QWERTY was simply this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZYXWVUTSRQPON&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first half of the alphabet, followed by the second half backwards.  You can still see this on the home row today, as DFGHJKL are 7 consecutive consonants.  The vowels and semi-vowels (W, Y) were moved to the top row later intentionally along with several other consonants and the S was moved based on the recommendations of some telegraph operators in the 1800s, at which point the B and C were moved down.  But yeah, the bottom two rows of the QWERTY keyboard are basically the alphabet.  So I find it utterly bizarre given that knowledge that people are still trained to do typing drills focused on the home row when the top row is where the only thought was done on the original QWERTY layout.  QWERTY predated the home row method, so using home row on QWERTY will certainly be inefficient when compared to using it on Dvorak and Colemak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "The first question that comes to my mind here is whether this is a Bodine thing or a Hendrick thing generally, because although I knew that Bodine was a much better qualifier than finisher, I knew that was true to an even more extreme degree in Ken Schrader's case.\n\nLooking it up, Tim Richmond had an average start of 4.7 and an average finish of 9.9 in 1986, with 8 poles to 7 wins.\n\nSchrader had 17 poles to 4 wins, and had a higher average start than average finish all but one year.\n\nWaltrip had many more wins than poles, but still had a higher average start in two seasons including the blockbuster 1989.\n\nI would say for most top drivers average starts are going to invariably be higher, because top drivers simply qualify more consistently than they finish. Qualifying is a one-lap speed and a single lap is less likely to be ruined by bad luck than a race containing hundreds of laps.\n\nSo all this is really saying is that Hendrick generally was much stronger in qualifying than in the races until Jeff Gordon arrived, which is no surprise, and actually Waltrip's late '80s bucked that trend a little.\n\nI really think average finish is more luck than skill. Do I think Bill Elliott's 1988 was better than his 1985, championship or not? No. He just had fewer unlucky races. Same for Bobby Labonte's 2000 vs. his 1999 or Dale Jarrett's '99 vs. his '97. In all three cases I believe the non-championship season was superior, but just unluckier.\n\nI think drivers play more of a role in their dominance than in their consistency, so I would tend to rate a dominant but inconsistent driver over a consistent, never-dominant one, which is in Bodine's favor. Although certainly he wasn't championship caliber. But I believe the peak finishes matter more and the subpar finishes (based on average finish and NASCAR's points systems) matter more than they should. The value between a 2nd and 3rd place finish should be much more than the value between a 42nd and 43rd place finish. Finish distributions should be weighted towards the higher positions, which would make your Bodines and Irvans look better. I do think both of them are hall of famers with Irvan being the stronger case, but while this is the second-strongest counterargument for Bodine (the strongest argument is easily his lackluster record vs. his teammates in 1986-89 and 1991), I think Bodine has several things in his favor that are undervalued.\n\nI think you're also wrong to assume that just because a team dominates in qualifying that they are the best team. Penske had lots of seasons in the late '90s/2000s with Wallace, Newman, and even Mayfield when they were dominating in qualifying and were they even remotely close to the best team? The same deal with Hendrick. \nWaltrip certainly did not come close to matching his Junior Johnson results while at Hendrick, so I don't think you can argue they were ever the best team pre-Jeff Gordon except for MAYBE 1986 and 1989.\n\nI think the short tracks and the road courses are where the driver has more impact and where you are most likely to overcome a horsepower disadvantage, and that is where drivers like Bodine, Rudd, Irvan, Gant, Richmond thrived which is why I like them more than superspeedway specialists like Baker, B. Labonte, and the like (who I think should be in too, as I have much lower standards than you do clearly.) Although I would certainly take Bodine last of those five. Bodine was one of only three to win on all three of the long-lasting road courses along with Rudd and Wallace, but that's admittedly sort of a quirk since not a whole lot of drivers competed on all three of them in their prime.\n\nPlus it's the NASCAR HoF, not the Cup HoF and I think that Bodine was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for years for most wins in a season with 45 NASCAR modified wins and that should really push him over the line if modified results are given as much weight as they are. I think he also did play a role in broadening NASCAR's geographic base outside the southeast, not to mention that he made certain innovations popular (isn't he credited with introducing power steering and closed-face helmets, and sadly, being the first driver to always without fail mention his sponsors in every interview, sort of starting the corporate NASCAR trend?) I also think he did a really nice job for the Bud Moore and self-owned teams in '93-'94 when I don't think those teams were as good as he was making them look. Yeah, sure, all the Hoosier drivers were qualifying up front in '94, but Bodine was the only one who was staying up there, apart from that one Pocono race, and I guess that Rockingham race Mast dominated. I also think Bodine's IROC title proves something. Although not technically NASCAR, it might as well have been by that era and should give him more cred.\n\nYes, he finished worse than he started, but I think you'll find that with most top drivers who qualified well simply because it's a lot easier to be consistent in qualifying. Yes, he was drastically outperformed by most teammates. But if you look at other arguments, I think he's HoF. If you think somebody like Benny Parsons or Carl Edwards should be the absolute lower limit, I agree he's not. But I'd go down to like Sterling Marlin and I know you'd find that ridiculous because we've talked about that on Twitter before.\n\nI'd say a top 50 driver. I think you way overestimate qualifying results in determining the strength of teams. I don't think anyone would say Ryan Newman had the best equipment most of those years, and I wouldn't throw Bodine in the Newman pile but you seem to be doing so.",

I do think both of them are hall of famers with Irvan being the stronger case, but while this is the second-strongest counterargument for Bodine (the strongest argument is easily his lackluster record vs. his teammates in 1986-89 and 1991), I think Bodine has several things in his favor that are undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re also wrong to assume that just because a team dominates in qualifying that they are the best team. Penske had lots of seasons in the late &amp;#39;90s/2000s with Wallace, Newman, and even Mayfield when they were dominating in qualifying and were they even remotely close to the best team? The same deal with Hendrick. \nWaltrip certainly did not come close to matching his Junior Johnson results while at Hendrick, so I don&amp;#39;t think you can argue they were ever the best team pre-Jeff Gordon except for MAYBE 1986 and 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the short tracks and the road courses are where the driver has more impact and where you are most likely to overcome a horsepower disadvantage, and that is where drivers like Bodine, Rudd, Irvan, Gant, Richmond thrived which is why I like them more than superspeedway specialists like Baker, B. Labonte, and the like (who I think should be in too, as I have much lower standards than you do clearly.) Although I would certainly take Bodine last of those five. Bodine was one of only three to win on all three of the long-lasting road courses along with Rudd and Wallace, but that&amp;#39;s admittedly sort of a quirk since not a whole lot of drivers competed on all three of them in their prime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus it&amp;#39;s the NASCAR HoF, not the Cup HoF and I think that Bodine was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for years for most wins in a season with 45 NASCAR modified wins and that should really push him over the line if modified results are given as much weight as they are. I think he also did play a role in broadening NASCAR&amp;#39;s geographic base outside the southeast, not to mention that he made certain innovations popular (isn&amp;#39;t he credited with introducing power steering and closed-face helmets, and sadly, being the first driver to always without fail mention his sponsors in every interview, sort of starting the corporate NASCAR trend?) I also think he did a really nice job for the Bud Moore and self-owned teams in &amp;#39;93-&amp;#39;94 when I don&amp;#39;t think those teams were as good as he was making them look. Yeah, sure, all the Hoosier drivers were qualifying up front in &amp;#39;94, but Bodine was the only one who was staying up there, apart from that one Pocono race, and I guess that Rockingham race Mast dominated. I also think Bodine&amp;#39;s IROC title proves something. Although not technically NASCAR, it might as well have been by that era and should give him more cred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, he finished worse than he started, but I think you&amp;#39;ll find that with most top drivers who qualified well simply because it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to be consistent in qualifying. Yes, he was drastically outperformed by most teammates. But if you look at other arguments, I think he&amp;#39;s HoF. If you think somebody like Benny Parsons or Carl Edwards should be the absolute lower limit, I agree he&amp;#39;s not. But I&amp;#39;d go down to like Sterling Marlin and I know you&amp;#39;d find that ridiculous because we&amp;#39;ve talked about that on Twitter before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say a top 50 driver. I think you way overestimate qualifying results in determining the strength of teams. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone would say Ryan Newman had the best equipment most of those years, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t throw Bodine in the Newman pile but you seem to be doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "I think the horsepower reduction in 2015 really hurt drivers from nontraditional backgrounds (sprint cars: Gordon/Stewart/Newman/Kahne, desert racing: Johnson) and helped drivers from traditional late-model backgrounds (Harvick, Logano, Keselowski, Busch brothers, Junior, Truex, and so on).  Until the past few years, especially last year, the drivers on the first list usually overachieved relative to their Xfinity results while the drivers on the second list usually underachieved in Cup, relative to their minor-league dominance.  I think the reason for the distinction is that Cup cars had much higher horsepower in past years and that really did make other forms of racing like sprint cars which had higher horsepower than minor-league NASCAR did better practice for higher horsepower Cup cars, but now the Cup cars are not higher horsepower and this is continuing for 2016, so I would continue to expect sprint car drivers to struggle (and Larson and Stenhouse haven't been that great out of the gate) while the drivers who have been in stock cars from day one will continue to dominate.  The reduced horsepower has now pretty much shut down the odds of sprint car drivers emerging into superstars and prevented them from having any chance of major-league success, after they were already essentially shut out of IndyCar when first in the '70s USAC banned rear-engine sprint cars and then later CART moved to a mostly road-course schedule (admittedly, given Gordon and Stewart's success on road courses despite their initial relative lack of experience on them, I definitely think it's short-sighted to assume that USAC drivers COULDN'T adapt to road course racing).  I understand why Tony George felt the IRL was a necessary move, but if he was going to do that, continuing to use formula cars (albeit cheaper ones) rather than coming up with some modernized roadster meant it would inevitably fail, as he was not going to find very many drivers (okay fine, Kenny Brack and Tony Stewart, but Stewart's open wheel career is very overrated) without CART experience who would be better than CART drivers at FORMULA racing...  Not to mention that every one of the IRL drivers who were actually good (except for Stewart) were road racing veterans as well.  Brack, Wheldon, Rice, and Hornish are still the only post-split Indy 500 winners without CART experience, and the last three were all graduates of CART's feeder series anyway...  If NASCAR wants to remain open to sprint car drivers (and Gordon and Stewart have certainly been major contributors to the last 25 years of NASCAR) the reduced horsepower is a bad idea.  However, the late model veterans now dominating must be salivating at the prospect of this continuing.\n\nBut...I could be wrong.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the horsepower reduction in 2015 really hurt drivers from nontraditional backgrounds (sprint cars: Gordon/Stewart/Newman/Kahne, desert racing: Johnson) and helped drivers from traditional late-model backgrounds (Harvick, Logano, Keselowski, Busch brothers, Junior, Truex, and so on).  Until the past few years, especially last year, the drivers on the first list usually overachieved relative to their Xfinity results while the drivers on the second list usually underachieved in Cup, relative to their minor-league dominance.  I think the reason for the distinction is that Cup cars had much higher horsepower in past years and that really did make other forms of racing like sprint cars which had higher horsepower than minor-league NASCAR did better practice for higher horsepower Cup cars, but now the Cup cars are not higher horsepower and this is continuing for 2016, so I would continue to expect sprint car drivers to struggle (and Larson and Stenhouse haven&amp;#39;t been that great out of the gate) while the drivers who have been in stock cars from day one will continue to dominate.  The reduced horsepower has now pretty much shut down the odds of sprint car drivers emerging into superstars and prevented them from having any chance of major-league success, after they were already essentially shut out of IndyCar when first in the &amp;#39;70s USAC banned rear-engine sprint cars and then later CART moved to a mostly road-course schedule (admittedly, given Gordon and Stewart&amp;#39;s success on road courses despite their initial relative lack of experience on them, I definitely think it&amp;#39;s short-sighted to assume that USAC drivers COULDN&amp;#39;T adapt to road course racing).  I understand why Tony George felt the IRL was a necessary move, but if he was going to do that, continuing to use formula cars (albeit cheaper ones) rather than coming up with some modernized roadster meant it would inevitably fail, as he was not going to find very many drivers (okay fine, Kenny Brack and Tony Stewart, but Stewart&amp;#39;s open wheel career is very overrated) without CART experience who would be better than CART drivers at FORMULA racing...  Not to mention that every one of the IRL drivers who were actually good (except for Stewart) were road racing veterans as well.  Brack, Wheldon, Rice, and Hornish are still the only post-split Indy 500 winners without CART experience, and the last three were all graduates of CART&amp;#39;s feeder series anyway...  If NASCAR wants to remain open to sprint car drivers (and Gordon and Stewart have certainly been major contributors to the last 25 years of NASCAR) the reduced horsepower is a bad idea.  However, the late model veterans now dominating must be salivating at the prospect of this continuing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But...I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Johnson, Kenseth, Junior, and Harvick will likely follow in the next 5 years (yes, Johnson started 9 years later than Gordon, but he's only 4 years younger).  Kurt Busch, Edwards, and Hamlin will likely stay around longer but they seem to have lost their edge as they are being outpaced by drivers like Harvick and Kenseth who are older than them.  Since 2006, there have only been two lasting major stars to emerge (Logano and Keselowski) and as the quality of talent in the feeder series is shallower than it was 10-15 years ago and most recent Xfinity/truck drivers are failing, it's going to be EASIER for Kyle to win races in the next decade than it was in the last one.\n\nI think very shortly Joey, Brad, and Kyle will probably all have 5 win seasons every single year/nearly every year as the competition level is about to plummet, but it may not happen until Johnson, Kenseth, and Harvick fall off which they haven't yet (but may in the near future.)",

Stewart is doing it in 2016.  Johnson, Kenseth, Junior, and Harvick will likely follow in the next 5 years (yes, Johnson started 9 years later than Gordon, but he&amp;#39;s only 4 years younger).  Kurt Busch, Edwards, and Hamlin will likely stay around longer but they seem to have lost their edge as they are being outpaced by drivers like Harvick and Kenseth who are older than them.  Since 2006, there have only been two lasting major stars to emerge (Logano and Keselowski) and as the quality of talent in the feeder series is shallower than it was 10-15 years ago and most recent Xfinity/truck drivers are failing, it&amp;#39;s going to be EASIER for Kyle to win races in the next decade than it was in the last one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think very shortly Joey, Brad, and Kyle will probably all have 5 win seasons every single year/nearly every year as the competition level is about to plummet, but it may not happen until Johnson, Kenseth, and Harvick fall off which they haven&amp;#39;t yet (but may in the near future.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
