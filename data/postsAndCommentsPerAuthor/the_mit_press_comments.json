From his day to the present, he looms large in tonnes of thinking about the future: either as an opponent who spurs people to think of solutions to the problems, or as a prophet who foresaw not only the perils of today's world but also the insuperable limits to human ambition.\n\nBut Malthus wasn't actually himself talking about extinction. He compares the French Revolution to an impending comet that might 'scorch up and destroy the shrinking inhabitants of the Earth' at one point, but doesn't actually seriously concern himself with humanity-ending disasters, just _humanity-culling_ ones.\n\nAnother way of putting it is that he talks about human-regulating disasters. Malthus was not interested in extinction: indeed, he was so sure of the ability for population to explode that his stress was in the opposite direction. We will constantly hit up against the limits to growth, be pared back, and then return to 'normal' levels until prosperity tempts another growth spurt. He warned about misery and death, but not actually human extinction.\n\nYou can see why he was so important in inspiring Darwin to think about population dynamics in the wild and how nature's \"balance\" is actually created by competition and feedbacks.\n\nAnd, a very interesting question: would Malthus's ideas been as impactful if he was writing beforehand? In light of the above: probably, yes. In fact, you _can_ actually find Malthusian statements going back a long way - the basic idea of subsistence crisis goes back before demography was even a concerted field of study! Machiavelli, for instance, says that human populations tend to expand until nature \"purges itself\" of them through famine or plague.\n\nTo your second question, Cambridge's CSER does lots of work on global environment and sustainability! [Here](https://www.cser.ac.uk/research/extreme-risks-and-global-environment/). \n\nAnd to your final question, regarding what you call 'cool' and 'exciting' risk scenarios, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfAWI2i9y1M) addresses precisely that hypothesis.",

Yes, of course, the spectre of global catastrophe and fear of impending doomsday loomed large in popular culture during the Cold War - I wouldn't want to obscure that at all. (However, actual 'kill mechanisms' for _outright_ extinction from a nuclear event remained unclear, as far as I see it: aside from speculative weapons -like Szilard's cobalt bomb/salted bomb- that were warned of as having the potential to create enough fallout to act as omni-fatal devices, the hypothesis that a nuclear exchange could cause global 'nuclear winter' only picked up momentum during the 1980s due to attention from Carl Sagan and growing consensus that a similar 'impact winter' might have killed the dinosaurs).\n\nAnd, yes, science fiction and popular culture has been flirting with human extinction, and its tragedy, since at least the early 1800s. What I meant was that it was in the 1980s that ethicists and philosophers started assessing just how bad.\n\nAnd you _can_ give a structure to badness! Jonathan Schell in 1982's _The Fate of the Earth_ pointed out that total extinction isn't just the death of however many billions of individuals are currently alive, but would also be the loss of the entire future. That makes it significantly worse, he argued. In his words, the 'supreme' tragedy. Perhaps it's more intuitive to focus on the loss of life, and neglect the wasted opportunity, but seeing both gives more clarity to just how bad it might be. The influential philosopher Derek Parfit added to this line of reasoning - he asked the question of how _much_ worse the death of 99% of the world's population is relative to the death of 100%. Both are atrocious, but the badness of the latter is '_much_ worse' than the former, Parfit persuasively [argued](https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/videos). In his own words:\n\n_\"The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago.

You can find scientists and natural philosophers saying such things quite early on in the 1700s. For example, Baron de Montesquieu spoke of humanity going extinct through depopulation in around 1720. (Ironic, because population expanded a lot in the years after he wrote that.) Other scientists, returned to the idea throughout the 1700s.\n\nBut it remained the kind of topic that would be spoken about at soirees in Enlightenment France - i.e. only spoken about by the intelligentsia.\n\nAround the turn of the 1800s, the idea of prehistoric beasts and species extinctions became accepted science. And the public took notice: there were popular tours of American mastodon skeletons through Europe. Then in the late Romantic period, between 1810 and 1830, there was a slew of popular writing on the topic of 'the last man'. This was a new idea for the general reading public: that humanity might not end all at once, and the planet along with it... it produced some great art (see John Martin) and fiction. The topic naturally gelled with the Romantic nexus of ideas on the sublime and human insignificance in the face of nature.\n\nAfter that, the idea that the Earth could continue after humanity was there to stay: though after a 'craze' during the Romantic era, the topic of outright extinction was somewhat overshadowed, in fiction and wider culture, by fascination with evolutionary degeneration during the Victorian era (following Darwin).",

Thank you so much for such a fantastic question!\n\nSo, first thing's first, _most_ people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries lived and conducted their lives believing in the full gamut of religious ideas that give us a sense of security and make an 'existential catastrophe' an impossible supposition.\n\nThe people I trace in the book were variously pioneers and stand-outs: the positions required to seriously think about human extinction in those early days (for example, naturalism and possibly some form of atheism or, at least, agnosticism) were fringe positions if you step out of cloistered academic or intellectual circles.\n\nBut yes, amongst those scientifically minded people it is surprising how quickly they reached some rather sound conclusions about largescale threats from nature. One example is Georges Buffon, a brilliant French polymath of the 1700s. He readily accepted prehistoric species extinctions, even when his colleagues often didn't, and thought that it could well happen to us. He wondered what animal would 'inherit the Earth' after we are gone. This was a century before Darwin!\n\nFor the most part, the catastrophes that people first worried about are the ones that we all know best. Comets and asteroids were an early one (though scientists were often more worried about what would happen to Earth if a comet flew close-by, rather than if it collided head-on: they feared that gravitational pull would cause continent-consuming tidal waves or perhaps the tail of the comet would douse our planet in suffocating gas!). Plague was also an early one. The first fictional novel depicting an existential catastrophe in English is Mary Shelley's 'Last Man'. Planetary cooling and heating was another early fear. Buffon gave the first experimental calculations of how long our planet would remain habitable.\n\nSome early fears were more strange, however. Immanuel Kant was already wondering whether more 'advanced beings' would one day emerge on Earth and cause our extinction in the 1790s!

Also Toby Ord's _The Precipice_ is a place to look for more.\n\nThere is a wider question about the stability of civilizations. There's interesting work that's been done on how humanity could recover from a civilizational collapse. Check out Lewis Dartnell's _The Knowledge_, for example. The accepted definition of an existential risk is a risk that causes our outright extinction or _permanent_ curtailing of our ability to fulfil our potential. So, if its feasible to recover from a civilizational collapse, then it would be no where near as bad as a full existential catastrophe. What's important here with relation to extinction risk, however, is that a civilizational collapse _would_ obviously make us more vulnerable to 'events outside of our control', as you put it. Perhaps it's the case that a cycle of recurrent collapses prevents us from reaching a level of technical ability to [protect ourselves](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1611/1611.06096.pdf) from astrophysical disasters (supernova detonation, for e.g.) and this would -sooner or later in- be a death sentence.

This is a very important question.\n\nThere are obviously crosslinks between the ways we think about eschatology/mythology and the ways we think about human extinction in a modern and scientific sense.\n\nBut I think the more interesting question is what are the distinctions? What is novel about the way we think about our ultimate fate now?\n\nI like to say that the distinction is this: ideas like apocalypse tend to match up neatly with our ideas of justice. Judgement Day implies that there is a moral order to the cosmos, that (even if inscrutable now) gets revealed at the end.\n\nSo, you get a 'sense of an ending'.\n\nContrarily, the modern notion of human extinction is that of humanity dying out as a species and the universe continuing aimlessly without us. In this instance, nothing is revealed... it's the end of moral activity (at least in this corner of the cosmos).\n\nSo, you get an 'ending of sense'.\n\nThe important distinction is this: apocalypse allows us to sit tight, knowing that the universe will eventually align with justice and value; extinction, on the other hand, summons us to a sense of responsibility, because if we disappear then so too does everything we think of as just and humanly valuable.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for asking! This is a very important question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are obviously crosslinks between the ways we think about eschatology/mythology and the ways we think about human extinction in a modern and scientific sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think the more interesting question is what are the distinctions? What is novel about the way we think about our ultimate fate now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to say that the distinction is this: ideas like apocalypse tend to match up neatly with our ideas of justice. Judgement Day implies that there is a moral order to the cosmos, that (even if inscrutable now) gets revealed at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you get a &amp;#39;sense of an ending&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrarily, the modern notion of human extinction is that of humanity dying out as a species and the universe continuing aimlessly without us. In this instance, nothing is revealed... it&amp;#39;s the end of moral activity (at least in this corner of the cosmos).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you get an &amp;#39;ending of sense&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important distinction is this: apocalypse allows us to sit tight, knowing that the universe will eventually align with justice and value; extinction, on the other hand, summons us to a sense of responsibility, because if we disappear then so too does everything we think of as just and humanly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Crowe's book _The Extraterrestrial Life Debate_ is stellar on this topic.\n\nIn some way or other, people in the West have been pondering aliens since at least the Ancient Greeks and potentially even before. For most of history, the general attitude was a very idealistic one: aliens were considered very similar to us. After the Copernican Revolution, it was presumed most other planets were inhabited and inhabited with humanoid beings. (This means the Copernican Revolution wasn't as de-centring as people often think!)\n\nIn the 1600s, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens claimed that ET might be crustaceans, but they'd still be similar in form to humans, and also would do all the stuff we do. Later, in the 1800s, H.C. Orsted claimed that all the planets would have exactly the same principles of rationality, governance, and even aesthetics. He and others saw the principles we have on Earth as cosmically universal. The universe was not just anthropic, but philanthropic. This was one of the reasons that people didn't think clearly about human extinction on Earth: it didn't matter so much, because there were humans (or human-equivalents) everywhere else!\n\nIn my eyes, it's only toward the end of the 1800s that you start getting more obviously ambivalent representations of aliens. H.G. Wells, H.P. Lovecraft, J.-H.

The Russian rocket designer, K. Tsiolkovsky, was the first to suppose that this is a reason why we haven't yet seen evidence of them. He proposed this around the turn of the 1900s! This notion developed into the idea of a 'galactic club' (the idea that we might one day join a cosmic union of minds and learn the collective library of the universe) and the 'cosmic zoo hypothesis' (the idea that we are kept in a state of captivity by hyper-advanced ETs, of which we have no awareness), and these are ideas that have proliferated through C20th science fiction.\n\nPersonally, I don't think we are very good at looking at ourselves from the perspective of an imagined outsider. But, looking at the history, we _have_ got better (and this implies we can get even better): our representation of intelligence, and the space of its possibilities, has become far more variegated, nuanced, capacious, and expansive.

How our body knows what mode is because of the eye's detection of blue light.

Find the type of questions you want to answer and more importantly the kind of scientist you want to be. Data science is going to be a key technology that shapes culture. There will be lots of ethical questions at play, particularly in regards to privacy. Be an advocate to protect people&amp;#39;s privacy and teach us how we can do that, too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can certainly understand, there is lots of money to be made and the work is very heady, but what we really need are data scientists that help people. So find ways to do that. Make cool things, but also build a body of work you can be proud of because you feel good about the decisions you made. It might be unpopular, but that is the price of being a vanguard. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is topic I'm personally very fond of.\n\nThe idea that human intellect is both a curse and a blessing, a gift and a poison, goes back very far. When things become secularised after the Enlightenment, you get the idea that we, as a species, might overdose on the disenchanting truth of science. The Italian pessimist-poet Giacomo Leopardi said that this was the fate of humanity: extinction by truth overdose. Then, later, after Darwin, this transmuted into the idea that, as you put it, intelligence is an 'evolutionary dead end'. Around the turn of the 1900s, there was a lot of orthogenetic ideas in evolution (which, at the time, held that _all_ species have an inherent youth, maturity, and senility - often defined by increasing 'over-specialization' or 'over-adaptation'). The idea became popular that human braininess was a fatal over-specialization, like the ponderous and giant antlers of the extinct Irish Elk. You get the Japanese eugenicist and biologist Oka Asajiro saying this will soon lead to our extinction in around 1900. Then, after WW1 and WW2, this picks up a bit: with scientists and writers playing around with the alluring analogy between the exploding sizes of brainpans across hominid evolution and the exploding weapons arsenals during the Cold War. Around the same time, various scientists thinking about the Fermi Paradox (see other comment in this AMA) started playing around with the 'dead end' hypothesis. \n\nMore recently, you get the idea that evolution in the long run 'selects out' technological intelligence in science fiction. Notably P. Watts's 2006 _Blindsight_ and Karl Schroeder's 2002 _Permanence_. Both play around with the idea that self-conscious technical methods of survival (i.e. a submarine) are costly and fragile, whilst unreflective natural adaptations are cheap and resilient (i.e. flippers and gills), so over time technological beings reach a kind of 'stability' with their environment that is unreflective, non-technological, and unconscious.

He compares the French Revolution to an impending comet that might 'scorch up and destroy the shrinking inhabitants of the Earth' at one point, but doesn't actually seriously concern himself with humanity-ending disasters, just _humanity-culling_ ones.\n\nAnother way of putting it is that he talks about human-regulating disasters. Malthus was not interested in extinction: indeed, he was so sure of the ability for population to explode that his stress was in the opposite direction. We will constantly hit up against the limits to growth, be pared back, and then return to 'normal' levels until prosperity tempts another growth spurt. He warned about misery and death, but not actually human extinction.\n\nYou can see why he was so important in inspiring Darwin to think about population dynamics in the wild and how nature's \"balance\" is actually created by competition and feedbacks.\n\nAnd, a very interesting question: would Malthus's ideas been as impactful if he was writing beforehand?

Yes, of course, the spectre of global catastrophe and fear of impending doomsday loomed large in popular culture during the Cold War - I wouldn't want to obscure that at all.

        "body": "Hi there! Thank you so much for such a fantastic question!\n\nSo, first thing's first, _most_ people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries lived and conducted their lives believing in the full gamut of religious ideas that give us a sense of security and make an 'existential catastrophe' an impossible supposition.\n\nThe people I trace in the book were variously pioneers and stand-outs: the positions required to seriously think about human extinction in those early days (for example, naturalism and possibly some form of atheism or, at least, agnosticism) were fringe positions if you step out of cloistered academic or intellectual circles.\n\nBut yes, amongst those scientifically minded people it is surprising how quickly they reached some rather sound conclusions about largescale threats from nature. One example is Georges Buffon, a brilliant French polymath of the 1700s. He readily accepted prehistoric species extinctions, even when his colleagues often didn't, and thought that it could well happen to us. He wondered what animal would 'inherit the Earth' after we are gone. This was a century before Darwin!\n\nFor the most part, the catastrophes that people first worried about are the ones that we all know best. Comets and asteroids were an early one (though scientists were often more worried about what would happen to Earth if a comet flew close-by, rather than if it collided head-on: they feared that gravitational pull would cause continent-consuming tidal waves or perhaps the tail of the comet would douse our planet in suffocating gas!). Plague was also an early one. The first fictional novel depicting an existential catastrophe in English is Mary Shelley's 'Last Man'. Planetary cooling and heating was another early fear.

Thank you so much for such a fantastic question!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, first thing&amp;#39;s first, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries lived and conducted their lives believing in the full gamut of religious ideas that give us a sense of security and make an &amp;#39;existential catastrophe&amp;#39; an impossible supposition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people I trace in the book were variously pioneers and stand-outs: the positions required to seriously think about human extinction in those early days (for example, naturalism and possibly some form of atheism or, at least, agnosticism) were fringe positions if you step out of cloistered academic or intellectual circles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yes, amongst those scientifically minded people it is surprising how quickly they reached some rather sound conclusions about largescale threats from nature. One example is Georges Buffon, a brilliant French polymath of the 1700s. He readily accepted prehistoric species extinctions, even when his colleagues often didn&amp;#39;t, and thought that it could well happen to us. He wondered what animal would &amp;#39;inherit the Earth&amp;#39; after we are gone. This was a century before Darwin!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the catastrophes that people first worried about are the ones that we all know best. Comets and asteroids were an early one (though scientists were often more worried about what would happen to Earth if a comet flew close-by, rather than if it collided head-on: they feared that gravitational pull would cause continent-consuming tidal waves or perhaps the tail of the comet would douse our planet in suffocating gas!). Plague was also an early one. The first fictional novel depicting an existential catastrophe in English is Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Last Man&amp;#39;. Planetary cooling and heating was another early fear. Buffon gave the first experimental calculations of how long our planet would remain habitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some early fears were more strange, however. Immanuel Kant was already wondering whether more &amp;#39;advanced beings&amp;#39; would one day emerge on Earth and cause our extinction in the 1790s! Jean Rousseau thought that the artificial pleasures of modern consumerism were distracting us from &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; reproductive drives and causing increasing infertility that would eventually lead to human extinction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recent, but on the topic of sudden alteration of gravity, however: see &lt;a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/57440551@N03/48847619886/in/photostream/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, of course!

But the first person I've ever seen to link this, explicitly, up with the conclusion that this would cause human extinction in a naturalistic sense (rather than the end of time or the religious millennium) is Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\nBut one of his disciples, Eduard von Hartmann, noted that the human species dying out through sexual abstinence wouldn't actually guarantee an end to suffering. He thought that humanoid creatures might re-evolve on Earth, or self-conscious sufferers would exist elsewhere in the cosmos.\n\nSo, his conclusion was rather shocking: to make sure that intelligence ends suffering, here and elsewhere throughout the cosmos, then it is the duty of intelligent beings to find a way of bringing about the end of the entire universe.\n\nHe was, strangely, a bit of a philosophical celebrity in his day. Perhaps because of the radicality of his thesis.\n\nHis vision is, obviously, mad: it leads to a form of cosmic euthanasia. But it was the culmination of a strand of hyper-pessimistic thinking that reached a head in Germany in the 1800s.\n\nAlternately, Marquis de Sade also said that the destruction of Earth, and extinction of humanity, would be a good thing. He did so in the 1790s! To be blunt about it, he said this because he was a sadist, and thought that maximizing _pain_ was good. Funnily enough though, this was because he was also convinced human-like beings would re-evolve: so extinguishing humanity wouldn't put an end to suffering forever, but would merely allow it to replenish by allowing a stage of 'rest' for nature to replenish its torturous energies.

He thought that humanoid creatures might re-evolve on Earth, or self-conscious sufferers would exist elsewhere in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, his conclusion was rather shocking: to make sure that intelligence ends suffering, here and elsewhere throughout the cosmos, then it is the duty of intelligent beings to find a way of bringing about the end of the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was, strangely, a bit of a philosophical celebrity in his day. Perhaps because of the radicality of his thesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His vision is, obviously, mad: it leads to a form of cosmic euthanasia. But it was the culmination of a strand of hyper-pessimistic thinking that reached a head in Germany in the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternately, Marquis de Sade also said that the destruction of Earth, and extinction of humanity, would be a good thing. He did so in the 1790s! To be blunt about it, he said this because he was a sadist, and thought that maximizing &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;/em&gt; was good. Funnily enough though, this was because he was also convinced human-like beings would re-evolve: so extinguishing humanity wouldn&amp;#39;t put an end to suffering forever, but would merely allow it to replenish by allowing a stage of &amp;#39;rest&amp;#39; for nature to replenish its torturous energies. Pretty evil stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Crowe's book _The Extraterrestrial Life Debate_ is stellar on this topic.\n\nIn some way or other, people in the West have been pondering aliens since at least the Ancient Greeks and potentially even before. For most of history, the general attitude was a very idealistic one: aliens were considered very similar to us. After the Copernican Revolution, it was presumed most other planets were inhabited and inhabited with humanoid beings. (This means the Copernican Revolution wasn't as de-centring as people often think!)\n\nIn the 1600s, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens claimed that ET might be crustaceans, but they'd still be similar in form to humans, and also would do all the stuff we do. Later, in the 1800s, H.C. Orsted claimed that all the planets would have exactly the same principles of rationality, governance, and even aesthetics. He and others saw the principles we have on Earth as cosmically universal. The universe was not just anthropic, but philanthropic. This was one of the reasons that people didn't think clearly about human extinction on Earth: it didn't matter so much, because there were humans (or human-equivalents) everywhere else!\n\nIn my eyes, it's only toward the end of the 1800s that you start getting more obviously ambivalent representations of aliens. H.G. Wells, H.P. Lovecraft, J.-H. Rosny aine, are authors that come to mind.\n\nAside from invasion though, you also get the first ideas that aliens are far more intellectually developed than us and look on us the same way we look on ants. The Russian rocket designer, K. Tsiolkovsky, was the first to suppose that this is a reason why we haven't yet seen evidence of them. He proposed this around the turn of the 1900s! This notion developed into the idea of a 'galactic club' (the idea that we might one day join a cosmic union of minds and learn the collective library of the universe) and the 'cosmic zoo hypothesis' (the idea that we are kept in a state of captivity by hyper-advanced ETs, of which we have no awareness), and these are ideas that have proliferated through C20th science fiction.\n\nPersonally, I don't think we are very good at looking at ourselves from the perspective of an imagined outsider. But, looking at the history, we _have_ got better (and this implies we can get even better): our representation of intelligence, and the space of its possibilities, has become far more variegated, nuanced, capacious, and expansive. With modern AI research and studies of animal intelligence that 'possibility space' is slowly but surely gaining more of a structure. Our idea of intelligence has gone from extremely anthropomorphic, to comparatively less so, but I'm sure it's safe to bet we've got a lot further to go...\n\nTo borrow the words of the 20th century biologist J.B.S Haldane: I'm sure the possibilities for intelligence are not just stranger than we suppose, but stranger than we _can_ currently suppose.",

We have pretty good idea that COVID-19 spreads pretty easily, with each infecting person one to 3 other people. That is more transmissible that SARS in 2002-2003 or Ebola, but not nearly as transmissible as measles.\n\nThe big known question is how many people does the virus kill or make seriously ill. In China, the fatality rate per case was about 3 percent and one out of 7 got severely ill. That is pretty severe – the 1918 flu had a case fatality rate of about 2 and the average flu has case fatality of about 0.1 percent\n\nThat said, outside of the overwhelmed health system of Hubei province, the case fatality rate from COVID-19 has been a lot lower.

I am glad to get to have this discussion with you.  \n\nThe short answer is that we don’t know yet. It is still a relatively new virus and with each day we’re learning more.  \n\nWe are pretty certain that COVID-19 will become a pandemic (with worldwide spread), but we don’t know yet for sure if it will a mild, moderate, or severe one.  \n\nThe issue is knowing more about (1) the transmissibility of the virus and (2) its severity. We have pretty good idea that COVID-19 spreads pretty easily, with each infecting person one to 3 other people. That is more transmissible that SARS in 2002-2003 or Ebola, but not nearly as transmissible as measles.\n\nThe big known question is how many people does the virus kill or make seriously ill.  In China, the fatality rate per case was about 3 percent and one out of 7 got severely ill.  That is pretty severe – the 1918 flu had a case fatality rate of about 2 and the average flu has case fatality of about 0.1 percent\n\nThat said, outside of the overwhelmed health system of Hubei province, the case fatality rate from COVID-19 has been a lot lower. As I wrote yesterday in Foreign Affairs, China has some of the poorest lung health in the world. Singapore has had 110 cases and no deaths.    \n\nHere is the FA link for those interested: https://t.co/cmkJZ71A2N?amp=1",

Alternatively, ask them a couple of questions (e.g., can you find this image? ) then show them how to do it.  Nothing beats a good demo, especially of reverse image search.  \n\nAnother idea:  I have some VERY short VERY fast demos that I call my [1-minute morceaux](https://sites.google.com/site/dmrussell/#h.p_Mg7p-B9t3q2G) \\-- they're probably things they haven't seen before.  \n\nFor determining credible sources... alas, there are no great shortcuts.  It's mostly being discerning about what you read.  (Sound familiar?)

Alternatively, ask them a couple of questions (e.g., can you find this image? ) then show them how to do it.  Nothing beats a good demo, especially of reverse image search.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another idea:  I have some VERY short VERY fast demos that I call my &lt;a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/dmrussell/#h.p_Mg7p-B9t3q2G\"&gt;1-minute morceaux&lt;/a&gt; -- they&amp;#39;re probably things they haven&amp;#39;t seen before.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For determining credible sources... alas, there are no great shortcuts.

That is, you might be searching for information about **jaguar** (the cat), but when you do the query **\\[ jaguar \\]**  all you see is information about the car, the Jaguar.  \n\nSo, a misalignment of expectations is the worst (mostly because it's hard for the system to detect).  \n\nLuckily, adding the word \"cat\" (or similar) gets you the results you want. \n\nAnother version of this problem is when you're searching for something very common, but you don't realize that it's common and get frustrated by the results.  Example:  I had a blogger complain that he could never find his blog on Google.  But his search was (I'm NOT making this up) **\\[ john smith blog** **\\]**  He had no idea that there are THOUSANDS of bloggers named John Smith, and he was just one among thousands.",

That is, you might be searching for information about &lt;strong&gt;jaguar&lt;/strong&gt; (the cat), but when you do the query &lt;strong&gt;[ jaguar ]&lt;/strong&gt;  all you see is information about the car, the Jaguar.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a misalignment of expectations is the worst (mostly because it&amp;#39;s hard for the system to detect).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, adding the word &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; (or similar) gets you the results you want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another version of this problem is when you&amp;#39;re searching for something very common, but you don&amp;#39;t realize that it&amp;#39;s common and get frustrated by the results.  Example:  I had a blogger complain that he could never find his blog on Google.  But his search was (I&amp;#39;m NOT making this up) &lt;strong&gt;[ john smith blog&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;  He had no idea that there are THOUSANDS of bloggers named John Smith, and he was just one among thousands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

First of all, the absolute majority of countries are younger than 100 years, so as long as we believe that citizenship is granted by states, it is difficult to speak of \"hundreds of years of hard work\". Secondly, \"work\" is valued in context and here the switch in the structures of inequalities in the world which many economists document is worth mentioning. Relying on Milanovic in my book I explain how the world's inequality today -- unlike 300 years ago -- is a matter of spacial disbalances, rather than class. What matters now is not whether you are a prince or a peasant, but *where* you are a prince or a peasant. The discrepancies are huge -- glass ceilings for some spaces can be thousands of times lower, radically affecting life chances, that the blue sky of other places. As long as inequalities are about spaces and given that citizenship is about a right to enter and to stay, it is citizenship, it turns out, that becomes the key tool of preservation of glogal inequalities. Algerians work very hard, but whatever they do they are bound to be paid much less then the French and will not be able to travel freely to the majoirty of the highest-developed countries around the globe. Is it because of hundreds of years of slacking? Not quite -- still in the beginning of 1960s Algeria used to be France and Algerians -- French. The story of justification of randomly assigned overwhelming priviledge does not quite hold in the world. Once a marker of belonging to a cast (citizenship) is assigned randomly with no individual features of the bearer in mind, this fact cannot be ratinally interpreted away in the world where the belief in equality and individual worth is held in high esteem.",

        "body": "TL;DR - The blue color was added by Gilligan to make Walt's meth stand out from his competitor's product, but it's one of the few artistic licenses they take with the science. It's better for the story overall though!\n\nLong answer - I didn't come across any instances where the writing team wanted to give the blue color a related chemical, re a chiral catalyst, but I do know they wanted to keep the writing as scientifically sound as possible while allowing for some artistic license. Even if they invented a catalyst from whole cloth, catalysts speed up the rate of a reaction but aren't actually consumed by it; you can recover a catalyst after the reaction has run, so it wouldn't impart any blue color even if it existed. And then there's the fact that the purer the meth is, the whiter it gets. \n\nAs for the branding-related dye, I think that only comes into play towards the end when Walt has hung up his meth-cooking gear and Lydia is getting sub-standard \"dirty\" meth from Todd and the White Supremacists. I believe there was talk of dying it to give it its signature color for her overseas clients, even though it wouldn't pass any purity tests. Ultimately, it was better for the drama and the narrative for Jack and his gang to have to bring Jesse back into the game. (Not so great for Jesse though...)\n\nThanks!",

There's ricin (often teased, but used only once), the Lily of the Valley plant, and a very brief mention of saxitoxin; the only one not mentioned by name (but probably used by Gus to poison the cartel) is likely cyanide. \n\nThough she's the only person to actually ingest Walt's carefully crafted ricin, it’s possible that Lydia Rodarte-Quayle is actually still alive out there in the world somewhere ... especially since Walt gave her the exact manner of her poisoning and she had been exposed to the ricin about 12 hours earlier, giving her plenty of time to seek medical attention.

Quick removal and disposal of clothes, along with washing yourself, is the first step in minimizing ricin’s effects.

Chemistry as change, or chirality as mirror images of the same molecule where one can be harmless and the other can be deadly, all pointing to Walt's transformation into the villainous Heisenberg. Then there's the great montage of Walt's discussion with Gretchen about the elemental components making up the human body, intercut with scenes of Walt and Jesse disposing of a acid-dissolved Emilio Koyama. (I really do miss these scenes in later episodes when Walt moves out of the classroom and into the meth business for real.)\n\n2) As far as I know, HF isn't the go-to acid for \"evidence\" disposal. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are more common; the latter was the chemical used by the so-called \"acid bath killer\" John Haigh in the 1940s. But for proper body disposal (say in careers dealing with the disposal of animal remains, or even human remains in cremation services), strong bases like lye/sodium hydroxide do a better job of breaking down a body's softer parts. The bases tend to cleave the bonds in proteins more easily, like those in hair, muscles, and fingernails, and can break down fats and oils as well, which is one reason lye is used in the soap-making process. Acids do have the dissolving edge when it comes to eating through bones and teeth, however. \n\n3) I've been a fan of Rian Johnson since 'Brick' and have enjoyed just about everything he's directed since then. I also love a good \"bottle episode\" where we spend an hour in one location with limited cast members. And I cringe every time Walt leans a little too far off the catwalk or tries to get up on that rickety ladder without support. In short, I'm a fan! How about you?",

Sure, you can do this with the novelty noisemakers, also known as bang snaps, but they are bits of gravel coated with silver fulminate, which is more explosive but less stable; it can't be aggregated in great quantities without self-detonating. \n\nSo let's say Walt added some silver fulminate to his fulminated mercury chemistry to get it to detonate on contact. Both chemicals are known as primary explosives, meaning they can easily explode with very little provocation and are used to trigger the detonation of more powerful but more stable compounds known as secondary explosives. But it's the explosive potential of Walt's bomb bag that is a sort of Goldilock's dilemma here: 50g was not powerful enough to blow the windows out of the mock-up scene (250g decimated the replicated room completely) but it *was* enough to injure everyone in the room, at the very least. \n\nIn addition to its explosive properties, a mercury fulminate explosion can also emit toxic nitrogen oxide fumes and aerosolized mercury salts upon combustion. So even if Walt’s homemade bomb hadn’t blinded the drug dealers with science, he could have at least played the long game and threatened them with long-term respiratory disease and mercury poisoning. But, of course, that ending isn’t nearly as explosive. \n\nFun fact: The effects and production team used PRIMACORD (an \"explosive rope\") to pull off the explosive scene, though they actually had to edit around just how explosive it was. They reined the damage in a bit to make Walt and Tuco's survival a bit more realistic.",

The laptop stowed safely away in the evidence locker poses a super difficult problem for Walt, Jesse, and Mike. The team argues over a variety of approaches, but it's ultimately Jesse who delivers the answer: Magnets! Then, we go through a great sequence where Walt explains that the 21 12V batteries wired in series (from the negative terminal of one battery to the positive terminal of the next, and so on) will provide plenty of power (252V) to run the electromagnet. But he also wants 21 12V batteries wired in parallel (negative to negative, positive to positive), increasing the available current or \"capacity.\"  The strength of a magnet’s magnetic field increases or decreases proportionately to the available current. Basically, Walt wants to double the available strength of the electromagnet to make sure it gets the job done.   \n\n\nThe issue is the distance here. So in the test run, when they fire up the electromagnet and give poor Jesse a laptop and make him take small steps closer to it to see how far the disruptive field extends, viewers get to see the laptop fly through the air and smash into the side of the truck. That's great Hollywood effects for the show, but the practical effect was actually done by rigging a cable that would zip the laptop out of Aaron Paul's hands and into the side of the truck. The brilliance here is that this test scenario established the rules of magnetism in Vince Gilligan's fictional world, so most people didn't blink when all the magnetic materials went flying at the evidence locker, regardless of the complications of real-world physics and things like the Biot-Savart Law.  \n\n\nCuriously, even putting super-strong rare earth magnets on either side of a spinning hard disk drive (HDD) doesn't actually affect the integrity of the stored data on the magnetic disks.

It's still dangerous, so don't see \"weak\" and think \"safe\", but the show could have gone with HCl (hydrochloric acid) or H2SO4 (sulfuric acid).

From small-scale lab tests, to full-scale recreations, to using an amped-up acid mix known as the \"piranha solution\", the tub and the floor remained intact no matter what they did.

There have to be issues relative to a person's personality, psychosocial development, family background, and other factors for games to even start to contribute to attitudinal or behavioral problems. At the same time I think parents should definitely be active in considering what media they want their kids to consume. At a teenager I watched Salem's Lot at a friend's house and had nightmares for a while. I also can't play survival horror games for the same reason. That's just to say some kids may not be mature enough to handle the themes in certain games at certain points in their lives. But that doesn't mean that games are a 'bad influence' - they are only one thread in our complex lives.",

They enjoy practicing and improving their technique, and then trying to perform optimally for a new run record.

Many of them also point out that the speedrunning community (while definitely not perfect) can be a very fun place, with people sharing tips and tricks for improvement, rather than hoarding their secrets. If you want to know more about the practice, Rainforest Scully-Blaker, my former MA student, wrote a great thesis about the practice of speedrunning.

It&amp;#39;s a really interesting phenomenon!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In terms of general tips for the mixing process, I have a favorite mantra I repeat to myself during the mixing process.  'Follow the lines.'  In music, there's usually foreground content that gives the composition its shape.  Whatever instrument is carrying this content has to receive top priority -- it's tracing the 'line' -- creating the contours of the musical experience we want listeners to have.  When I mix, I try to 'follow the line,' and emphasize whatever instruments are giving the music its shape and sense of movement.  The line is often traded from instrument to instrument, so following the line becomes very important.  In addition to that, I try to prioritize instruments according to their importance in the overall structure of the piece.  As the composer, I have very definite ideas about what elements are most important in any ensemble I'm mixing, so I set level automation accordingly.  This is one of the reasons why it's great to be able to mix your own compositions.",

Sounds like you're putting together either a Horizontal Resequencing system or a system based on the triggering of stingers -- not sure which, but either choice is cool.    Regarding the layering music system you described... I talk about Vertical Layering a bunch in my book.  One of my first experiences with it was for The Maw video game from Twisted Pixel games.  Level layout and player progress were both determining factors when making choices about where layers would be triggered and manipulated.  The system had three layers of dynamic music per composition -- a layer for slapstick situations, a layer for exploring, and a layer for special circumstances (like flying, fighting, or fire breathing).  Depending on where the player was or what the player was doing, the layers would turn on and off or adjust their volume up and down.  When I was planning out this system, I combed through the game for good triggering points and drew up a sort-of roadmap for the audio implementation at Twisted Pixel, so they'd know how the music should behave during gameplay.

But on the other hand, it's based on the Speed Racer manga and the film by the Wachowskis, so there's this retro nostalgia and all these over-the-top visual aspects, glowing with neon colors and throw-back designs.  I knew I'd have to meld the techno genre with a lot of other eclectic musical influences in order for the music to feel right.  I ended up just hurling all kinds of elements at the score, from James Bond-type orchestral stuff to ragtime.  It's one of the zaniest scores I've ever composed, and I had a fantastic time doing it.  One of the biggest considerations was the sense of speed that the music might be able to convey.  I wanted the music to make the racing feel faster, so I experimented with fast foreground rhythm and melody contrasted against slow-moving bass lines, which made everything feel faster.  I also worked all kinds of engine sounds and doppler effects into the music.",

It&amp;#39;s one of the zaniest scores I&amp;#39;ve ever composed, and I had a fantastic time doing it.  One of the biggest considerations was the sense of speed that the music might be able to convey.  I wanted the music to make the racing feel faster, so I experimented with fast foreground rhythm and melody contrasted against slow-moving bass lines, which made everything feel faster.  I also worked all kinds of engine sounds and doppler effects into the music.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Fugues are very contrapuntal -- there are lots of different melodic lines happening simultaneously, and they interact with each other in interesting ways.  I did a lot of experimentation with Ziggurat Theme, particularly in regards to the vocals that would form the backbone of the track.

Regarding your question -- I'll delve into synthesis from time to time, depending on the project.  For the Speed Racer video game from Warner Bros. Interactive, I loaded my sound palette with a lot of synthetic sounds, and I tinkered a lot with them in order to achieve the distinctly analog/retro flavor that I wanted for that project.  The whole aesthetic of Speed Racer is focused on a retro-futuristic vibe, so I wanted the music to reflect that as well.  I also did some major synth tinkering for one of my latest projects, Sports Scramble for the Oculus Quest.  It was fun trying to recreate the feel of those antique synths we remember from techno and hip-hop sports anthems (you can hear some of that in my music for the trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om\\_q1lzbJPQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om_q1lzbJPQ)).

I have to construct everything to work within the music system, so the composition has to be geared to accommodate that.  The specific accommodations depend on the nature of the dynamic music system.  If it's horizontal resequencing, I'm going to be thinking about music in terms of segmentation, constructing it so that it locks together like interchangeable building blocks.  If it's a vertical layering structure, I'm going to be thinking about how the instrumental performances in a single composition can be disassembled and reorganized into smaller ensembles that will still be entertaining to listen to on their own.  It can get pretty complicated -- I get into much more detail in my book, A Composer's Guide to Game Music ([https://amzn.to/2YQfj1d](https://amzn.to/2YQfj1d)).  In terms of the programs, I'll use whatever the development team prefers, or sometimes I'll deliver the audio recording structured into the correct building blocks so they can be assembled by the audio team in their own implementation software.",

The PC2x isn't my first Kurzweil keyboard, so there's a bit of brand loyalty going on.  I like that this keyboard is balanced right in the middle between being a dedicated keyboard workstation and a pure controller.  The keyboard has some great pre-loaded sounds that I come back to again and again.  The keys have the weighted action I like.  But the keyboard also has a nice assortment of knobs, buttons, sliders, wheels, and everything is thoroughly assignable.  This makes it really useful for my work.  Regarding working with sound designers -- sometimes I'll have no contact with the sound designers.  Other times, a sound designer serves as my primary supervisor.  Depends on how big the audio team is, and the philosophy of the team in regards to music and sound needs for the project.",

It really helps when you have some depth in your portfolio, beyond the kind of assignments that your professors might be giving you.  Working with student dev teams can be an awesome opportunity, so be sure to make friends with all the budding game devs at your school!  Also, maybe you can connect with student teams at other schools by networking online.  Your university days can be an important chance for you to forge relationships that can turn into great professional opportunities.",

When people are experiencing game music, they're also doing something active.  They're playing a game, and that activity changes how they experience the music in a profound way.  There have been studies showing that when we hear music while we're doing something else, we tend to internalize that music and remember it more vividly than when we hear it in more passive circumstances.  So game music has the chance to really imprint itself in the minds of gamers.  In terms of recognition -- I think that situation is rapidly improving.

I talk about repetition fatigue repeatedly in my book A Composer's Guide to Game Music (in chapters 4, 9, 10 and 12).  Avoiding repetition fatigue is incredibly tricky.  Regarding how many leitmotifs and recurring themes do I use... that varies per project.  For instance, my music for the Speed Racer game only had a couple of recurring themes, but my music for Assassin's Creed Liberation had -loads- of them.  I think the depth and complexity of the narrative can exert an influence on how many leitmotifs and themes would work successfully.  If the story has lots of characters and explores a lot of important issues and ideas, then it will probably be able to support a large assortment of themes.  Otherwise, it might make more sense to use fewer themes and associate them with only the most important aspects of the game.",

I wrote a -lot- of tracks for the franchise, starting with music for LittleBigPlanet 2, then continuing on to LittleBigPlanet 3, LittleBigPlanet Cross Controller, LittleBigPlanet PS Vita, and LittleBigPlanet Toy Story.  An extra cool aspect of composing for LBP -- not only does the music exist as a part of the excellent game levels created by the development teams, but it's also available to players.  They can implement it in their own levels.  The music is constructed with interactive components, so it can be manipulated in a lot of ways by players.  I love seeing how the LBP community uses the music I've composed for the franchise.  It's so cool to see my music as a part of their creative expression.

She was producing the series for National Public Radio, hosting the series and editing the scripts.  She hired me to compose the music and do the sound design.  It was my first gig as a professional composer, and it was an -incredible- way for me to learn the craft.  The series adapted classic stories for the radio.

She hired me to compose the music and do the sound design.  It was my first gig as a professional composer, and it was an -incredible- way for me to learn the craft.  The series adapted classic stories for the radio.

        "body": "Hi, jasecom89!  You're right about the creative license that composers sometimes have to define the sound of a game.  When we're brought in before the levels are finished, our music might actually have a big impact on the design of those levels.  For instance, after I was hired to compose music for LittleBigPlanet 2, my first assignment was to create music for the Victoria's Lab level, and I was given the description of the main character as a sort of mad scientist figure.  She likes to build killer robots, and she's a bit nuts.  Always a delightful combination!  So I composed a track with a lot of dark elements -- gritty guitars, epic orchestral strings, etc.  But since it's also a LittleBigPlanet track, I made sure to infuse it with a lot of fun and wacky elements, like calliope, accordion, beat boxing, vocoder, and so on.  Later, I found out that after I'd submitted the music, the level designers had gone back to the drawing board and revised the level pretty extensively.  When I finally saw the level, Victoria was still a mad scientist, but now she was also a baker.  The level was filled with cookies and cakes, and Sackboy could attack the killer robots by hurling giant cupcakes at them.  The team at Media Molecule let me know that they'd changed the level because the music had inspired them.  I can't express how much that meant to me.  The folks at Media Molecule are profoundly gifted and amazing, so I was so touched that my contribution helped to shape their creative process!

It's challenging for a game composer, but also incredibly stimulating and inspiring.  Kind of like trying to solve a really good puzzle.  Composing interactive music for a game often requires a game composer to construct the harmonic progressions so that they can transition in several different optional directions -- allowing the game engine to pick and choose depending on what's happening in the game.  To make this happen, the composer records the music in separate distinct segments, and the game engine picks and chooses the segments according to what's happening during gameplay.  It's a complicated subject -- I actually produced a series of four tutorial videos about it in connection with my book, A Composer's Guide to Game Music.  Here's the first video: [https://youtu.be/plVLJ1OXAiE](https://youtu.be/plVLJ1OXAiE)",

You might try stopping repeatedly and listening.  Pick a favorite track as a reference, and let it teach you about itself.  Listen deeply.  Try to identify what&amp;#39;s going on.  Let it swim around in your subconscious.  It might help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Since I'm an external contractor, I'm mostly working off-site.  I don't have the kind of in-person social interactions that can become problematic for other women in the industry, so in a way I've been shielded from those problems.  I suppose it's possible that being a woman has impacted whether I'm hired for a project or not... but again, it's hard for me to tell.  Hiring decisions don't tend to be explained.  There was one time when I did notice that being a woman had put me at a disadvantage, but it wasn't a serious problem -- just a bummer.  I got hired for a project, and a team member started sending me e-mails to talk about the music needs of the game.  He was calling me 'dude' and 'man.'  I think he thought the name Winifred was male.  I suppose it's understandable - the name has 'fred' in it.  :)  Anyway, he kept saying things like, 'yeah, man it's gonna be great.

As a bit of backstory -- when working on the Victoria's Lab music for LittleBigPlanet 2, I relied on a classical structure called an 'Aria et Fugato.'  It included a mini-fugue, which is a kind of music composition with a lot of counterpoint.  Very complex.  After doing that, I got extra ambitious and though, well... heck!  I did a mini-fugue.

Maybe if an orchestral sample library was created that was incredibly expressive but so compact that it could be used directly in a game engine, so that the composer could just create the entire score in MIDI... that would be rad.

It invites me to invent a futuristic development in my field that would make my life infinitely easier.  I&amp;#39;m enjoying this thought process!  Maybe if computers became powerful enough so that I could host all my instruments on one PC.  That would be nice.  Maybe if an orchestral sample library was created that was incredibly expressive but so compact that it could be used directly in a game engine, so that the composer could just create the entire score in MIDI... that would be rad.  Thanks, immerc!  That was fun.  Back to reality.  :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Regarding your question -- the difference between game music and normal music?  Well, normal music has a beginning, that proceeds to a middle, and then concludes with an ending.  Game music usually doesn't have any of those things.  At its simplest, game music is composed so that it can be repeated indefinitely, which means that it must be composed with a very different composition structure than traditional music.  As game composers, we have to think about what qualities will help players to enjoy a piece of music that repeats, and what qualities will lessen that enjoyment.  Beyond this simplest of considerations, as game music gets more interactive and responsive to the actions of the player, the whole situation grows exponentially more complex.  The music starts getting fragmented into many different segments that can be juggled around according to the action of the game.  It can be very challenging for a traditional composer to understand how fundamentally different game music composition is.",
