She would check in with me if she read a script where they had me doing something crazy to make sure that I was cool with it.\n\nAmy was our leader for sure.  When you're on a show the lead actor has a responsibility (whether they want it or not) to set the tone for the show.  P&amp;R became a show that other actors wanted to do because they had heard what a wonderful set it was.  Amy set the down and we all happily followed.  People also have to remember that when you do a show that goes on for seven years that things in our home lives aren't always wonderful.  Amy went through a divorce during Parks but still brought her smile and kindness to set every day.  That's not to say that she wasn't upset and having to deal with a terrible situation but she's the ultimate pro and brought laugher every day.  I truly can't say enough about her Amy is as a person.

When you&amp;#39;re on a show the lead actor has a responsibility (whether they want it or not) to set the tone for the show.
