There are a couple of sites that aggregate published Snowden documents, including [https://snowdenarchive.cjfe.org/greenstone/cgi-bin/library.cgi](https://snowdenarchive.cjfe.org/greenstone/cgi-bin/library.cgi). There may be a better one. Someone here should pipe up if they know.\n2. \"On file with author\" usually means I'm not prepared to publish the original, but serious researchers can ask me for exceptions. No promise.\n3. I'm not sure what you mean about poor formatting, but I used Microsoft Office where Open Office did not seem to show docs as they were meant to display.\n4. There are many forms of finished intelligence. None of the more formal ones were in the archive, but there were Intellipedia articles and memos that made use of raw material and analysis.\n5. The stories definitely did not come out in an orderly way, due to scale and time pressure. I wrote first about what caught my eye and was easy to understand and confirm. Many, many stories were not told in full by one or several documents. I had to mine them for clues, assemble pieces from multiple documents, and seek outside information to understand what the story would be. And there was another class of data in the files that presented serious dilemmas, journalistically, which took a lot of time to resolve. One example: I had 160,000 raw intercepts of private conversations that the NSA collected.
