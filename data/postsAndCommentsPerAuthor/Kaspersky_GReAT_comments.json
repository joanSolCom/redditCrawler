Our products and services are developed with the full SDL cycle, including:  \n* Static analysis in blocking mode – code can’t be submitted to VCS if the analyzer finds any problems  \n* All code has to pass our review process, certain critical code is sent in blocking mode  \n* Parser code (including unpackers) is fuzzed on a constant basis  \n \nWe drive the whole SDL, including fuzzing, and support for the whole infrastructure.

That’s a cool question, thanks for asking it!  \nAs geeks, I like to think we do a lot of cool technical stuff behind the doors and rarely have the chance to talk about them. The usage of AI and big data are pretty much omnipresent nowadays and probably not just for us. For instance, we recently started working on KTAE, the Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine, a tool that allows us to correlate new cyberattacks to known threat actors. This allows us to speed up investigations and response and generally have better and quicker detections. While designing some KTAE algorithms for n-gram extraction, we realized that we could use machine learning to identify the most effective values for n, as well as the entropy of the extracted string. To give an example, there are 99,991 10-byte strings (that we can move as a “window”) inside a 100,000 bytes file. To look for similarities, we could extract all these individually, then check them against our malware database. Then, we can do the same with 8 byte strings, 7 byte, 6 byte, or even 11 bytes, 12 bytes and so on. The volume of data to extract and parse will soon get very large. To optimize the extraction and matching we put the data through a system that used machine learning to find the most effective combinations. This allowed us to reduce the number of extracted n-grams to a few hundred for 100,000 bytes. Nevertheless, for our malware collection, which is over 5 petabytes in size, the data is still huge - hence, big data. Combining big data with machine learning we built a solution that is practical and works. Going forward, we will likely have to use AI and data science more and more. This year, the average number of malware we receive daily, which used to be in the range of 320k samples per day, grew significantly. Back in the days, our analysts, including myself, would spend the entire day processing between 50 and 300 samples each. Obviously, this is no longer feasible.To process all the new malware, we have a multitude of systems, which combine feature extraction, similarity, dynamic and static analysis and push this through expert systems that decide the likelihood of a program being malware or not. Meanwhile, our analysts can focus on other things, such as targeted ransomware, while users are getting faster and  more effective protection. Just some of the wonders of modern computing :-)",

I personally know the folks working on Windows Defender and I can say wholeheartedly they are smart, thorough, dedicated, hard working and doing some great things to advance Windows security. Especially during the past years, Defender has become a basic protection tool that raises the bar for threat actors willing to infect users. For some, this basic level of protection may be enough. Others might want to get some additional protection. Looking at this from a car analogy point of view - when you buy your car from the dealer, it comes with keys and some basic locks. If you live in a tough neighborhood, you may want to install an alarm, so more advanced protections. Sadly, in the past years, the internet is looking more and more like a tough neighbourhood, so my advice is: do get the extra protection. As for keeping viruses away, here’s a few checkpoints:  \n\n* keep your OS and third party apps up to date\n* don’t use pirate software or cracks (I know you’ve said you don’t, good!!)\n* use strong, different and unique passwords for all your online resources\n* use a VPN when connecting from untrusted locations\n* block running untrusted applications with a whitelisting / default deny policy\n* use a modern, secure browser, such as Chrome or Firefox\n* use an Adblocker, cookie blocker and enforce HTTPS connections\n* regularly backup your data to encrypted offline storages  \n\nStay safe!",

So when something truly severe is happening we don’t panic and start doing something that’s up to us. By the way, talking about your example with WannaCry our antivirus detected it and our users were protected from that threat.   \n\nVitaly: I remember the emergence of ransomware in 2006. It was the first type of asymmetric cryptography ransomware using RSA (a family called GpCode at that time). We kept warning that it was going to become a big problem and we should address that as soon as possible. We even broke several of their attempts to improve that ransomware. They disappeared for a decade, but look where we are now: organized crime is using that in targeted fashion with high stakes, demanding millions of dollars for decryption.  \n\nDmitry here: The KIDO aka Conficker one was another big thing. It relied on a Windows vulnerability and the disinfection process was painful enough and unsuccessful if no patch applied. No surprise to find it yet in some countries, spreading via removable devices. Crazy!",

By the way, talking about your example with WannaCry our antivirus detected it and our users were protected from that threat.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vitaly: I remember the emergence of ransomware in 2006. It was the first type of asymmetric cryptography ransomware using RSA (a family called GpCode at that time). We kept warning that it was going to become a big problem and we should address that as soon as possible. We even broke several of their attempts to improve that ransomware. They disappeared for a decade, but look where we are now: organized crime is using that in targeted fashion with high stakes, demanding millions of dollars for decryption.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dmitry here: The KIDO aka Conficker one was another big thing. It relied on a Windows vulnerability and the disinfection process was painful enough and unsuccessful if no patch applied. No surprise to find it yet in some countries, spreading via removable devices. Crazy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Nevertheless, you can find reports from our ICS team in our blogs.  \n\nAriel here: Some threat actors target industrial systems, although targeting their ‘normal’ (non-PLC) systems. We recently published about MontysThree for example, which exclusively attacked Industrial companies. There are also more widely known APT groups such as Lazarus which won’t shy away from attacking Industrial systems too, simply because it’s fitting their campaign goal. We in GReAT collaborate with the ICS team in Kaspersky whenever we encounter such attack campaigns.",

There are also other researchers from other companies who invest a lot of their time and effort in this area. The reason you hear less about such attacks is that they are rare because they require very specific knowledge and skills to implement and of course are a lot more difficult to investigate as well. Nevertheless, you can find reports from our ICS team in our blogs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ariel here: Some threat actors target industrial systems, although targeting their ‘normal’ (non-PLC) systems. We recently published about MontysThree for example, which exclusively attacked Industrial companies. There are also more widely known APT groups such as Lazarus which won’t shy away from attacking Industrial systems too, simply because it’s fitting their campaign goal. We in GReAT collaborate with the ICS team in Kaspersky whenever we encounter such attack campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I’d highlight the increase in the number of malware written in Go or Perl, which is bulky and somehow more difficult to detect by traditional heuristics. Usage of scripting languages, such as Powershell and Javascript is also increasing, these are cheap and effective methods to kickstart an APT operation from scratch, which is something more and more popular these days. In terms of initial access, the landscape is split between good old MS Office macros and various exploits, both patched and 0days. If you’d like us to expand on any of these, just let me know!   \n\nKurt here: ransomware and more ransomware   \n\nAriel: if you want to get a deeper look into this, you can check out our latest APT trends report here: https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/ We do these every quarter.",

I’d highlight the increase in the number of malware written in Go or Perl, which is bulky and somehow more difficult to detect by traditional heuristics. Usage of scripting languages, such as Powershell and Javascript is also increasing, these are cheap and effective methods to kickstart an APT operation from scratch, which is something more and more popular these days. In terms of initial access, the landscape is split between good old MS Office macros and various exploits, both patched and 0days. If you’d like us to expand on any of these, just let me know!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kurt here: ransomware and more ransomware   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ariel: if you want to get a deeper look into this, you can check out our latest APT trends report here: &lt;a href=\"https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/\"&gt;https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/&lt;/a&gt; We do these every quarter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

General knowledge of reverse engineering helps, although we know many people who write Yara rules without ever having reversed any samples! A general feel of how malware looks like, how malware works and things like file formats is probably a good start. In case you haven’t seen it yet, do check out this short webinar I did on Yara back in March: https://securelist.com/hunting-apts-with-yara/96386/   \n\nPS: Our PR and sales are kindly asking me to try to sell you this training :) Some people say it’s pretty good actually: https://xtraining.kaspersky.com/   \n\n\nVitaly here: To add to what Costin said and give him some credits, please watch this short presentation written entirely in Yara about Costin using Yara to catch 0-days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbidgtOXvc0   \n\nIn essence, those skills are not required, but the more you know the more tools you have to create your own perfect Yara rule!",

General knowledge of reverse engineering helps, although we know many people who write Yara rules without ever having reversed any samples! A general feel of how malware looks like, how malware works and things like file formats is probably a good start. In case you haven’t seen it yet, do check out this short webinar I did on Yara back in March: &lt;a href=\"https://securelist.com/hunting-apts-with-yara/96386/\"&gt;https://securelist.com/hunting-apts-with-yara/96386/&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: Our PR and sales are kindly asking me to try to sell you this training :) Some people say it’s pretty good actually: &lt;a href=\"https://xtraining.kaspersky.com/\"&gt;https://xtraining.kaspersky.com/&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vitaly here: To add to what Costin said and give him some credits, please watch this short presentation written entirely in Yara about Costin using Yara to catch 0-days: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbidgtOXvc0\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbidgtOXvc0&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In essence, those skills are not required, but the more you know the more tools you have to create your own perfect Yara rule!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That’s a cool question, thanks for asking it!  \nAs geeks, I like to think we do a lot of cool technical stuff behind the doors and rarely have the chance to talk about them. The usage of AI and big data are pretty much omnipresent nowadays and probably not just for us. For instance, we recently started working on KTAE, the Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine, a tool that allows us to correlate new cyberattacks to known threat actors. This allows us to speed up investigations and response and generally have better and quicker detections. While designing some KTAE algorithms for n-gram extraction, we realized that we could use machine learning to identify the most effective values for n, as well as the entropy of the extracted string. To give an example, there are 99,991 10-byte strings (that we can move as a “window”) inside a 100,000 bytes file. To look for similarities, we could extract all these individually, then check them against our malware database. Then, we can do the same with 8 byte strings, 7 byte, 6 byte, or even 11 bytes, 12 bytes and so on. The volume of data to extract and parse will soon get very large. To optimize the extraction and matching we put the data through a system that used machine learning to find the most effective combinations. This allowed us to reduce the number of extracted n-grams to a few hundred for 100,000 bytes. Nevertheless, for our malware collection, which is over 5 petabytes in size, the data is still huge - hence, big data. Combining big data with machine learning we built a solution that is practical and works. Going forward, we will likely have to use AI and data science more and more. This year, the average number of malware we receive daily, which used to be in the range of 320k samples per day, grew significantly. Back in the days, our analysts, including myself, would spend the entire day processing between 50 and 300 samples each. Obviously, this is no longer feasible.To process all the new malware, we have a multitude of systems, which combine feature extraction, similarity, dynamic and static analysis and push this through expert systems that decide the likelihood of a program being malware or not. Meanwhile, our analysts can focus on other things, such as targeted ransomware, while users are getting faster and  more effective protection. Just some of the wonders of modern computing :-)",

I remember that getting on the stage, there was some tension in the air, kind of unexplained, but definitely there. At the very back of the room I saw three people standing, with a look that suggested they weren’t happy with this talk. I later asked the organizer who they were and the answer was, “We don’t know; they came at the last minute, paid in cash and only stayed for the Stuxnet talk.” A week or two later, after returning home, I got back from work and found a rubber cube on the table in the living room, with the message: “Take a break”. I can tell you this felt pretty scary at that time, a proof that cyberthreat research may have some unpleasant, real repercussions in the real world.",

Your question reminds me of a story: back in 2010, I presented on Stuxnet, which was relatively new at that time, at the Virus Bulletin conference in Vancouver. I remember that getting on the stage, there was some tension in the air, kind of unexplained, but definitely there. At the very back of the room I saw three people standing, with a look that suggested they weren’t happy with this talk. I later asked the organizer who they were and the answer was, “We don’t know; they came at the last minute, paid in cash and only stayed for the Stuxnet talk.” A week or two later, after returning home, I got back from work and found a rubber cube on the table in the living room, with the message: “Take a break”. I can tell you this felt pretty scary at that time, a proof that cyberthreat research may have some unpleasant, real repercussions in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In August 2016 we identified and blocked attempts to hack into a bank in Indonesia, where the attackers tried to deploy SWIFT data harvesting malware which is very similar (implementation of some functions such as logging) to the one we suspect were used to attack the Bangladesh bank. While the general opinion is that Lazarus were behind it, we attributed this activity to BlueNoroff.   \n\nDan here: check out some of the videos we talked about te Lazarus group: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vh2n6nC0t4 .

In August 2016 we identified and blocked attempts to hack into a bank in Indonesia, where the attackers tried to deploy SWIFT data harvesting malware which is very similar (implementation of some functions such as logging) to the one we suspect were used to attack the Bangladesh bank. While the general opinion is that Lazarus were behind it, we attributed this activity to BlueNoroff.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan here: check out some of the videos we talked about te Lazarus group: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vh2n6nC0t4\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vh2n6nC0t4&lt;/a&gt; . We also presented more info about Lazarus during our 2017 Security Analyst Summit conference, in St Maarten&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I personally know the folks working on Windows Defender and I can say wholeheartedly they are smart, thorough, dedicated, hard working and doing some great things to advance Windows security. Especially during the past years, Defender has become a basic protection tool that raises the bar for threat actors willing to infect users. For some, this basic level of protection may be enough. Others might want to get some additional protection. Looking at this from a car analogy point of view - when you buy your car from the dealer, it comes with keys and some basic locks. If you live in a tough neighborhood, you may want to install an alarm, so more advanced protections. Sadly, in the past years, the internet is looking more and more like a tough neighbourhood, so my advice is: do get the extra protection. As for keeping viruses away, here’s a few checkpoints:  \n\n* keep your OS and third party apps up to date\n* don’t use pirate software or cracks (I know you’ve said you don’t, good!!)\n* use strong, different and unique passwords for all your online resources\n* use a VPN when connecting from untrusted locations\n* block running untrusted applications with a whitelisting / default deny policy\n* use a modern, secure browser, such as Chrome or Firefox\n* use an Adblocker, cookie blocker and enforce HTTPS connections\n* regularly backup your data to encrypted offline storages  \n\nStay safe!",

It comes from the Tétrade umbrella, which targets victims in Latin America and some selected countries worldwide. We just dropped a public blogpost about it here: https://securelist.com/ghimob-tetrade-threat-mobile-devices/99228/   \nAmong other stuff, there is a Prilex resurrection;they are back to business targeting PoS devices with a MaaS scheme.

We write private intelligence reports for our customers, but we also publish some of it in our quarterly APT report on Securelist. Here’s the last one - &lt;a href=\"https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/\"&gt;https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dmitry here: Ghimob is a good example of what is going on in the financial world of attacks. It comes from the Tétrade umbrella, which targets victims in Latin America and some selected countries worldwide. We just dropped a public blogpost about it here: &lt;a href=\"https://securelist.com/ghimob-tetrade-threat-mobile-devices/99228/\"&gt;https://securelist.com/ghimob-tetrade-threat-mobile-devices/99228/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAmong other stuff, there is a Prilex resurrection;they are back to business targeting PoS devices with a MaaS scheme. They introduced a new method to perform the fraud instead of replay-attacks.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kurt here: Always.

That’s what results in great work!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kurt here: focus your work on what you are interested in. Try to get your name and good work in front of people - bsides and other conferences are out there too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In some countries your entire life is connected to your cell phone number. So, when you go shopping and make other payments, they might ask for your phone number. If provided, it will connect  those purchases on that number. Potentially if fraudulent purchases are made,  it might lead to unwanted actions and situations in general.   \n\n**Question 2**\n\nNoushin here: Security should not be an afterthought. In order to have a secure platform, you need people who deeply understand security to be involved in your design phase, implementation, and all the way to the support phase. These people need to have a thorough knowledge and sometimes years and years of experience working in the industry.

The best way is not to hunt for certifications but  learn how to break and fix things.

En otras palabras, qué tan probable es que las exploten y si es que lo hacen, qué impacto podrán causar. Ahora que todos estamos con el teletrabajo, probablemente lo que más se ha de proteger son los sistemas de acceso remoto, lo que incluye el protocolo de Escritorio Remoto y las aplicaciones de las VPN comerciales que dan acceso a las redes corporativas.

If so, there have been cases of true “technical genius” but rarely do these make the news :)  The issue with revealing some of these is simply divulging your sources and methods to the really smart bad guys that we’re all afraid of losing visibility on.  But I will challenge your question with my own...What makes an expert adversary? Technical genius or the uncanny MacGyver-like ability to get things done whenever they want with the tools they have available?  I’ve seen some very difficult adversaries who refuse to use nothing more than open source malware and macros.  I’ve also seen some VERY technically savvy adversaries make really dumb mistakes and blow an entire operation.  ",

If so, there have been cases of true “technical genius” but rarely do these make the news :)  The issue with revealing some of these is simply divulging your sources and methods to the really smart bad guys that we’re all afraid of losing visibility on.  But I will challenge your question with my own...What makes an expert adversary? Technical genius or the uncanny MacGyver-like ability to get things done whenever they want with the tools they have available?  I’ve seen some very difficult adversaries who refuse to use nothing more than open source malware and macros.  I’ve also seen some VERY technically savvy adversaries make really dumb mistakes and blow an entire operation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
