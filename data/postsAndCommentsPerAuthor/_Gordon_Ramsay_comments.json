        "body": "That's a personal question. I've never had any problems answering that. I've never been at home seven night a week cooking for the kids. What I've instilled in the kids, from day one, is a work ethic. So, the time we spend together is limited, but it's quality. But, I made a conscious decision eighteen years ago when I opened the restaurant *Gordon Ramsay*, to strive to earn my third Michelin Star, I never wanted to open it weekends, so we closed Saturday and Sunday. So, they wouldn't see me eighteen hours a day Monday through Friday and they'd see me absolutely fucked on Saturday morning. But, we got to spend the quality time together. How does that resonate today? I only took them there for the first time two years ago. Because there was no way on earth that I was ever going to introduce to them that level of food and be served by twenty waiters and waited hand and foot on because it was their daddy's restaurant. I need to protect them and respect the restaurant and team in my restaurant. I made them as normal as possible, like I said, from the beginning they had a work ethic. They've all got jobs, they've all taken care of animals, they've all got housework. There's a rotor. They get pocket money, but they have to earn that pocket money. The well-respected Megan is at Oxford Brookes studying, she's doing a degree in Philosophy. Jack wants to be a marine. Holly was to go into fashion. And Tilly, Matilda, is the chef of the family. She has her own show on CBVCs on the BBC in the UK. They're all hard-working, passionate individuals that have respect for others and respect for life. And, more importantly, understand that if you want something in life, it's not passed over, a hand-me-down. They got to work for it. That's really important for me. \n\nListen, I was there. At his age at 39 and 29 and 19 behind the line. You have to make sacrifices. There's no fast-track to becoming successful. Yes, you can make it. 39 is not old and more importantly, be selective on what restaurant you're going to work in. If you're gonna go and spend eight to ten to twelve hours in a restaurant as a line cook then make sure it's a fucking great restaurant. Make sure they deserve your time and make sure every six months, you're climbing the ladder. Because if you're not then you're not working correctly and you're not playing to your strengths. Set aside that fact that your son is only five and don't look at the current situation and dictate that for the rest of your life. Climb the ladder, but make sure you're in a great restaurant. Don't try to climb the ladder in an average restaurant because you're not going anywhere. So, get yourself into a good restaurant. \n\nVery kind. Thank you. But there's one thing I learned as a young chef growing up and working my ass off in these restaurants. The sacrifice I was making was coming back tenfold in experience. There's nothing wrong with being behind the line, but being behind the line in a great place because at the end of that shift or that service, you're going back a much better person than you started the day with and that's what cooking is all about.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a personal question. I&amp;#39;ve never had any problems answering that. I&amp;#39;ve never been at home seven night a week cooking for the kids. What I&amp;#39;ve instilled in the kids, from day one, is a work ethic. So, the time we spend together is limited, but it&amp;#39;s quality. But, I made a conscious decision eighteen years ago when I opened the restaurant &lt;em&gt;Gordon Ramsay&lt;/em&gt;, to strive to earn my third Michelin Star, I never wanted to open it weekends, so we closed Saturday and Sunday. So, they wouldn&amp;#39;t see me eighteen hours a day Monday through Friday and they&amp;#39;d see me absolutely fucked on Saturday morning. But, we got to spend the quality time together. How does that resonate today? I only took them there for the first time two years ago. Because there was no way on earth that I was ever going to introduce to them that level of food and be served by twenty waiters and waited hand and foot on because it was their daddy&amp;#39;s restaurant. I need to protect them and respect the restaurant and team in my restaurant. I made them as normal as possible, like I said, from the beginning they had a work ethic. They&amp;#39;ve all got jobs, they&amp;#39;ve all taken care of animals, they&amp;#39;ve all got housework. There&amp;#39;s a rotor. They get pocket money, but they have to earn that pocket money. The well-respected Megan is at Oxford Brookes studying, she&amp;#39;s doing a degree in Philosophy. Jack wants to be a marine. Holly was to go into fashion. And Tilly, Matilda, is the chef of the family. She has her own show on CBVCs on the BBC in the UK. They&amp;#39;re all hard-working, passionate individuals that have respect for others and respect for life. And, more importantly, understand that if you want something in life, it&amp;#39;s not passed over, a hand-me-down. They got to work for it. That&amp;#39;s really important for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Listen, I was there. At his age at 39 and 29 and 19 behind the line. You have to make sacrifices. There&amp;#39;s no fast-track to becoming successful. Yes, you can make it. 39 is not old and more importantly, be selective on what restaurant you&amp;#39;re going to work in. If you&amp;#39;re gonna go and spend eight to ten to twelve hours in a restaurant as a line cook then make sure it&amp;#39;s a fucking great restaurant. Make sure they deserve your time and make sure every six months, you&amp;#39;re climbing the ladder. Because if you&amp;#39;re not then you&amp;#39;re not working correctly and you&amp;#39;re not playing to your strengths. Set aside that fact that your son is only five and don&amp;#39;t look at the current situation and dictate that for the rest of your life. Climb the ladder, but make sure you&amp;#39;re in a great restaurant. Don&amp;#39;t try to climb the ladder in an average restaurant because you&amp;#39;re not going anywhere.

Honestly, I'd say about 12 years ago, I was struggling under immense pressure and I was finding it very difficult to switch off, so I started running. I ran like a sack of shit for the first 18 months, I was terrible. I remember my first match, someone shouted by the bridge halfway, \"Ramsey, where's your sports bra?\" So, apart from taking abuse on my first ever match and finishing in the dark, I started running. That gave me more time to myself and I could sort of process the pressure and recharge my battery. It sounded a bit weird because I was in the kitchen since 7:30 in the morning breaking at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, in the gym for an hour, and then back at 5:30 or 6, and stay until around 11 or midnight. That one hour in the gym a day completely distressed me. I couldn't run every day.  Every other day, I could run. After marathon, I took up triathalon because that gave me a little bit more time to myself. Weather it was swim in the morning. A long bike ride on the weekends. Triathlons saved my life. That put things in perspective in a way I could claw back, valuable, independent time that took me away from the hustle of running production companies to major networks, to the pressure of the Michelin Guide. I found that balance and that release, and that's really important. The busier I got, the fitter I got. I think it's the same in science, in the way that you need to be disciplined to take that time out, spend 90 minutes every other day processing what you got and what you're doing. I think a lot of the bike, I think a lot on a swim, I think a lot on the run and that's really good important time for me. ",

The best way to get a start in any top kitchen in Europe is to knock on the back door because you don't get paid, just go and spend a couple of days, it will open your eyes up tremendously. Once you got in with one chef and you show them that you are that determined and focus, that's all you need to do. Once you've got your foot in the door, ask their help for the 2nd inside and the 2nd job. Once you've done one chef a great favor, by working in their kitchen, use him to get you into the 2nd and the 3rd restaurant. That's the way you look after talent, what we do in our kitchen. \n\nRegarding the job on the boat, I'd recommend any young chef, once they've chocked up some great knowledge and insight, to understand another culture, a different language. The only way I got to work on a boat, in the south of France, I went down there and I was very fortunate, I knew a couple of friends and customers. Go, literally, up to the boats, ask to speak to the captain. The best time in the south of France is March, April right through to September. For the Caribbean it's around November to March. Literally, walk up to the dock, ask to speak to the captain, show them your resume and tell him how hungry you are, in terms of drive and commitment, and that's the best way to get a job.\n\nBest marathon I ever did, my 4th of 5th London marathon, I've done 12, but #4 was my best time, at 3:30. My dream was to get under 3:30 but I missed it by 14 seconds. I came running down the strand, running past Buckingham Palace, and they stopped me! The BBC stopped me for an interview! I spent 35 seconds on an interview, knowing full well that I had broken my time, had I done my PB. I was coming down with like 100 meters to go, and I could see the clock turning like 3:29:55, I thought \"Oh shit!,\" \"Shiitake!\" So, I missed it by 14 seconds. Our eldest daughter, we have a foundation for the Great Ormond Children's Hospital. Megan, who is 18, she's got her first London marathon this April.

I thought that it was going to be a little bit more adventurous. \n\nThe best thing to do first is put your cheese into the freezer for five minutes before you put them in the breadcrumbs. Most importantly, make sure that you flour, egg wash, and breadcrumb them totally because you need to seal the cheese to prevent it from leaking. You don't need to cook the cheese. So, the best thing to do is to cook them shallow fried very, very quickly and all you're doing is, literally, turning the breadcrumbs golden brown. But, there's a great way of doing this quickly and that is take your Panko bread crumbs and blend them in a blender, so they become finer and therefore, they cook quicker. Because if you overcook them then obviously the cheese will start melting and it will burst through there. Or you can double coat them. So, flour, egg wash, breadcrumb and then do that again. If you put a second coating on top, slightly thicker, it will protect the cheese. But, the easiest way is to put the cheese in the freezer for fives minutes to get it nice and firm before you flour, egg wash, and breadcrumb. ",

Eric from the Firehouse in Brooklyn, New York, made an incredible dish in the early rounds of Masterchef regarding a New York strip, and he garnished it with these wild mushrooms, but the sauce was *incredible*.

So that was a family-built hotel; mom and dad fragmented through the loss of their son through a tragic accident, but the place was just gorgeous. And the parents were incredible, and it was just devastating to see the heartache that was caused on losing their son, and how they became recluses and then gave up. So, giving them that confidence and support in reestablishing that lodge and putting that back on the map was one of the best and most heartfelt programs ever.\n\nOne of the most frustrating programs, well probably the hotel last night, the Brick Hotel outside of Philadelphia, where the restrooms in the hotel were almost stuck in a time warp, and the grey curtains were white curtains back in 1991. And just the filth, and just the general sort of deterioration of this building. As a pillar of the community, and having a hotel on your doorstep with the local community is really important, but it doesn't mean to say that you have to make money from that community. But supporting that community, and being open to locals, as opposed to closing your door on locals, was the worst they could ever do. So I think last night's program was the one that, for me, was one of the most frustrating hotels because the manager / owner was sort of ripping off the locals. And out of season, the locals--and in season--man that's your bread and butter. You have to look after them. And there is one or two ways across that hotel that you can appeal to them without sounding cheap or without sounding that you're degrading. ",

We have a national Wellington Day here in Britain now, and it's so nice to see everybody attempting to do it. I get thousands of messages and pictures a week of people across the world showing me their Wellingtons. So if I see a Wellington on some other chef's menu, that's the first thing I'll go to. And even though it's often done for two, I'll order it for one, and pay double just to make sure I get to see it.\n\nBased on the success of the burger I served in Vegas with Planet Hollywood, we have a percentage of chuck, all beef with a fat percentage of 10%, brisket and chuck, and then short rib. So for me, the secret behind any great burger is the fat content. But, if you want to take it to another level, as it's caramelizing on the charcoal grill, or a wood-burning grill, basting your burger with Devonshire butter puts a completely different spin on it. If you can put fresh chiles in that butter, or a red wine reduction, and make that butter unctuous, delicious, rich...wait until you see the flavor difference, the profile of basting your burger with butter. Brushing it over. The difference is night and day.\n\nMarco was great, I mean a total hard-ass. The guy has turned into a pussycat now, and Australia loves him. I remember him for the way he taught me to put food on the plate with such disciplined fingers. But one of the most inspirational chefs I've ever had a chance to work with, that would have to be Guy Savoy in Paris. You know, I was 22 years of age, I was on my knees, I didn't have a pot to piss in, and I was working on the lowest salary anywhere in France. But, that guy gave me hope, he gave me light, and he gave me support. So yeah, I'd say Guy Savoy in Paris. It's funny now, but we see each other in Vegas, because we've got restaurants in Vegas now, and his name's above Caesar's Palace and I'm behind him. So, it's pretty incredible.",

Those aren&amp;#39;t necessary all those who came in first of second in the competition, I&amp;#39;m talking about contestants who have been in the top ten, top five, so yea, there&amp;#39;s a lot that I&amp;#39;m proud of. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But don't be scared to take a break. I did it myself, traveled the world, through Sardinia, Sicily, and had the most amazing time, and what i *learned* after that experience was that I could do in 1 hour on a boat what i was doing in 14-15 hours in the professional kitchen.

It's a guy who is judging you incognito. We have a lot of guys in this country, and Europe, who are a bit too familiar, too chummy with chefs, and they overindulge - food editors, they'll know, and tip off the chef. With a Michelin guide, you have *no* idea when they'll be in, or when they'll review you. And that's why they're the most feared and respected by chefs.\n\nNow I'm always asked - you're a hands-on chef, you're on TV, how come you're still with these stars? Who does the cooking when you're not there? \n\nWhen I'm not there, I have trusted proper chefs - like Clare Smyth, the chef de cuisine in Chelsea - even when I'm there, she's still running the ship. She's been running it there for 10 years.\n\nSo the stars are awarded to the restaurant. And sometimes the chefs think the stars belong to the chefs, but they belong to the restaurant. The service is just as important. Michelin's had a hard time in America, because it was late coming to the table. But if there's one thing I respect, it's consistency. They manage to identify consistently, and it's all there for the customer.\n\nSo when people ask me \"What do you think of Michelin?\" I don't cook for the guide, I cook for *customers.* ",

Who does the cooking when you&amp;#39;re not there? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m not there, I have trusted proper chefs - like Clare Smyth, the chef de cuisine in Chelsea - even when I&amp;#39;m there, she&amp;#39;s still running the ship. She&amp;#39;s been running it there for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the stars are awarded to the restaurant. And sometimes the chefs think the stars belong to the chefs, but they belong to the restaurant. The service is just as important. Michelin&amp;#39;s had a hard time in America, because it was late coming to the table. But if there&amp;#39;s one thing I respect, it&amp;#39;s consistency. They manage to identify consistently, and it&amp;#39;s all there for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when people ask me &amp;quot;What do you think of Michelin?&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t cook for the guide, I cook for &lt;em&gt;customers.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
