        "body": "Good question. Many of the “medical” and in almost all surgical masks that you see on the market are mostly made from polypropylene (plastic). The raw plastic undergoes a variety of pretty sophisticated processes that turn it into different fabric-like soft nonwoven materials. A typical approved surgical mask for instance usually consists of 3 layers (3-ply) of these materials. One of the operative words here is non-woven. When things are woven they end up with a predictable or grid like like pattern that enables air and its accompanying particles to pass through relatively seamlessly. Nonwoven materials are made of fibers that are highly randomized and more tightly entangled. This makes it much more difficult for particles to pass through uninterrupted. Each of the 3 layers of these masks also has a relatively high degree of water repellency. They aren’t water “proof” per se but their permeability is very low, such that water will bead up on them and can be poured off as if it were being poured from a hard surface. The middle layer in masks is a nonwoven meltblown polypropylene material. This is the filter layer and is the least permeable of all 3. Between the 3 layers they help keep your stuff in",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good question. Many of the “medical” and in almost all surgical masks that you see on the market are mostly made from polypropylene (plastic). The raw plastic undergoes a variety of pretty sophisticated processes that turn it into different fabric-like soft nonwoven materials. A typical approved surgical mask for instance usually consists of 3 layers (3-ply) of these materials. One of the operative words here is non-woven. When things are woven they end up with a predictable or grid like like pattern that enables air and its accompanying particles to pass through relatively seamlessly. Nonwoven materials are made of fibers that are highly randomized and more tightly entangled. This makes it much more difficult for particles to pass through uninterrupted. Each of the 3 layers of these masks also has a relatively high degree of water repellency. They aren’t water “proof” per se but their permeability is very low, such that water will bead up on them and can be poured off as if it were being poured from a hard surface. The middle layer in masks is a nonwoven meltblown polypropylene material. This is the filter layer and is the least permeable of all 3. Between the 3 layers they help keep your stuff in&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
