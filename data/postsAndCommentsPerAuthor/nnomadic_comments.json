        "body": "I can promise you as someone diagnosed with ADHD I wish it was this simple. I was diagnosed late in life and thought this way too once. \n\nI literally can feel thoughts sliding off a plate sometimes, memory lapses, forgetfulness even on my best days when I am quite happy. These things I thought were normal until I actually understood what is happening. And it can be detected on an MRI and is hereditary. I am successful and have long term goals but I sure as hell had to work a lot harder than my peers with a lot of tutors and help. \n\nI actually developed a stutter from it which led me to being diagnosed at 30. Medication stopped it instantly. I wish I didn't spend years hating myself for  executive dysfunction. I would have had a much easier and happier life. A lot of people who have ADHD have been previously misdiagnosed for depression. It's not just an attention thing, I don't have normal filters for stimuli around me and it makes me sensitive to sound, especially and touch. \n\nPlease don't assume these things. It's not easy. And people with ADHD, a chemical imbalance, actually do respond from the medication differently. Legal speed is literally a chill pill for me and some days it just doesn't work at all and I revert to severe anxiety to the point I can't use the phone. My fight or flight response is fundamentally broken and I exhibited developmental delays, also common in ADHD, because of this.\n\nThese things are subtle and I was misdiagnosed with depression for years. It's estimated that up to 10% of the pop has it, mostly undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. I'm lucky enough to be diagnosed but I only knew to self refer because my dad was diagnosed in his sixties, otherwise I would have contually gone to the eighth+ doctor in ten years and three countries who would have just thrown SSRIs at me after expressing that they don't work and make everything worse at nauseum.\n\nStimulants fixed so many problems that I did not know I had as well as most of the ones I knew I had. I can actually reconnect with people again. Please don't assume this is just a modern issue. There are historic basis as well for why this is so misunderstood by the general public. If you're curious to know more go to the YouTube channel How to ADHD. One of the videos about women with ADHD describes this quite a bit.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can promise you as someone diagnosed with ADHD I wish it was this simple. I was diagnosed late in life and thought this way too once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally can feel thoughts sliding off a plate sometimes, memory lapses, forgetfulness even on my best days when I am quite happy. These things I thought were normal until I actually understood what is happening. And it can be detected on an MRI and is hereditary. I am successful and have long term goals but I sure as hell had to work a lot harder than my peers with a lot of tutors and help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually developed a stutter from it which led me to being diagnosed at 30. Medication stopped it instantly. I wish I didn&amp;#39;t spend years hating myself for  executive dysfunction. I would have had a much easier and happier life. A lot of people who have ADHD have been previously misdiagnosed for depression. It&amp;#39;s not just an attention thing, I don&amp;#39;t have normal filters for stimuli around me and it makes me sensitive to sound, especially and touch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t assume these things. It&amp;#39;s not easy. And people with ADHD, a chemical imbalance, actually do respond from the medication differently. Legal speed is literally a chill pill for me and some days it just doesn&amp;#39;t work at all and I revert to severe anxiety to the point I can&amp;#39;t use the phone. My fight or flight response is fundamentally broken and I exhibited developmental delays, also common in ADHD, because of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These things are subtle and I was misdiagnosed with depression for years. It&amp;#39;s estimated that up to 10% of the pop has it, mostly undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. I&amp;#39;m lucky enough to be diagnosed but I only knew to self refer because my dad was diagnosed in his sixties, otherwise I would have contually gone to the eighth+ doctor in ten years and three countries who would have just thrown SSRIs at me after expressing that they don&amp;#39;t work and make everything worse at nauseum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stimulants fixed so many problems that I did not know I had as well as most of the ones I knew I had. I can actually reconnect with people again. Please don&amp;#39;t assume this is just a modern issue. There are historic basis as well for why this is so misunderstood by the general public. If you&amp;#39;re curious to know more go to the YouTube channel How to ADHD. One of the videos about women with ADHD describes this quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And you *DIDN'T* mess that flair up. The ecology is the most important part, but I may be a bit biased. :)\n\nI study this stuff. Here's a bit about my project: [https://theconversation.com/bogs-are-unique-records-of-history-heres-why-100627](https://theconversation.com/bogs-are-unique-records-of-history-heres-why-100627)\n\nChapter 3 of this book will give you a lot more detail on this: Peatlands and Environmental Change by Dan Charman - [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peatlands-Environmental-Change-Dan-Charman/dp/0471969907](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peatlands-Environmental-Change-Dan-Charman/dp/0471969907) Let me know if you need some scans, though if you are working in this area you might want to check out the real deal, and google around because that seems overpriced for what I paid for that book. I am due for flipping through this book again anyway. I would highly recommend it upon rereading what you wrote, as it can help define a lot of the nuisance of the different parts of these kinds of environments.\n\nThis is actually an ideal location. We study these locations in the UK, but from a palaeoenvironmental perspective. There are many locations like this across the British Isles and Ireland and this is where they form.\n\nA quick and dirty tl;dr: These areas are giant sponges, at around 90%+ water. There's not much solid to them and the things that live in them enjoy quite shit, acidic anoxic and wet conditions, in fact, I often measure more biodiversity after these areas are drained out for cultivation (but that is not an indicator of environmental health, be wary! we need lots of these areas too). The tidal regime keeps it saturated during the dry months and keeps other dryland species from colonising and naturally infilling the area.

And be careful Mire and Saltmarsh are two seperate things! And you &lt;em&gt;DIDN&amp;#39;T&lt;/em&gt; mess that flair up. The ecology is the most important part, but I may be a bit biased. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I study this stuff. Here&amp;#39;s a bit about my project: &lt;a href=\"https://theconversation.com/bogs-are-unique-records-of-history-heres-why-100627\"&gt;https://theconversation.com/bogs-are-unique-records-of-history-heres-why-100627&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 of this book will give you a lot more detail on this: Peatlands and Environmental Change by Dan Charman - &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peatlands-Environmental-Change-Dan-Charman/dp/0471969907\"&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peatlands-Environmental-Change-Dan-Charman/dp/0471969907&lt;/a&gt; Let me know if you need some scans, though if you are working in this area you might want to check out the real deal, and google around because that seems overpriced for what I paid for that book. I am due for flipping through this book again anyway. I would highly recommend it upon rereading what you wrote, as it can help define a lot of the nuisance of the different parts of these kinds of environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is actually an ideal location. We study these locations in the UK, but from a palaeoenvironmental perspective. There are many locations like this across the British Isles and Ireland and this is where they form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick and dirty tl;dr: These areas are giant sponges, at around 90%+ water. There&amp;#39;s not much solid to them and the things that live in them enjoy quite shit, acidic anoxic and wet conditions, in fact, I often measure more biodiversity after these areas are drained out for cultivation (but that is not an indicator of environmental health, be wary! we need lots of these areas too). The tidal regime keeps it saturated during the dry months and keeps other dryland species from colonising and naturally infilling the area.

They will have you experience your highest highs with your lowest lows. That's what makes them so hard to escape. They are also confusing and messy, obscuring the door.\n\nThere is a lot of pain and heartache down the road you desperately want to seek and I would discourage you from it. If you want to try, there is the couple therapy's route, but if he rejects the idea then you have your answer. You cannot help people that do not want to change and that isn't healthy for you.\n\nThere are public resources in most countries for escaping these situations, though and you will not be alone in the journey. If you need help searching for these, drop me a PM and we can take a look. \n\nBreak ups, especially at your age, are the most painful as they are a new experience and your body and brain are still developing. You also need help, this isn't just him. You will need time to heal and how to protect yourself from this kind of behaviour in the future. \n\nI am going to PM you a book you may want to read through. It's called  The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence. You can read a bit more about what people have to say here: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gift-Fear-Survival-Signals-Violence/dp/0747538352/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gift+of+fear&amp;qid=1606505963&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1",

They are also confusing and messy, obscuring the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of pain and heartache down the road you desperately want to seek and I would discourage you from it. If you want to try, there is the couple therapy&amp;#39;s route, but if he rejects the idea then you have your answer. You cannot help people that do not want to change and that isn&amp;#39;t healthy for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are public resources in most countries for escaping these situations, though and you will not be alone in the journey. If you need help searching for these, drop me a PM and we can take a look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Break ups, especially at your age, are the most painful as they are a new experience and your body and brain are still developing. You also need help, this isn&amp;#39;t just him. You will need time to heal and how to protect yourself from this kind of behaviour in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am going to PM you a book you may want to read through. It&amp;#39;s called  The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence. You can read a bit more about what people have to say here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gift-Fear-Survival-Signals-Violence/dp/0747538352/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=gift+of+fear&amp;amp;qid=1606505963&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1\"&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gift-Fear-Survival-Signals-Violence/dp/0747538352/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=gift+of+fear&amp;amp;qid=1606505963&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Chile literally just toppled an American placed system this year. Ever hear of School of the Americas? We placed war criminals in to fuck up the third world royally. \n\nOf course EU is similar. Half of them had empires as well and current trends are populist reactions towards migration, which, spoiler alert, are because of imperialist policies and environmental change. Hell, even the new EU climate policy changes are based on off shoring a lot of pollution to these places. \n\nThis is a fundamental flaw in these old systems and they need reformed to not be based on exploitation of those at home or abroad. It's not sustainable and it does not have to be this way. We have a large population now with mass communication and literacy. We can do better.\n\nFor the downdooters: Let me tell you about the Powell Memorandum, the reaction to the formation of the EPA. This shit is nothing new. \n\n\"On August 23, 1971, less than two months before he was nominated to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Lewis F. Powell, Jr. mailed a confidential memorandum to his friend Eugene B. Sydnor, Jr., Chair of the Education Committee of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The memo was titled Attack On American Free Enterprise System and outlined ways in which business should defend and counter attack against a \"broad attack\" from \"disquieting voices.\"\n\nDocuments:\nhttps://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/\n\nAnd you know what? This is why we are here today, more of the same bullshit. This is why we have the Chamber of Commerce, who's job is to make government put buisness before people. This is why Fox News exists. \n\nWhy do you think nearly every major civil rights activist we know as household names identified as a socialist? No one ever talks about it, that's by design. \n\nMore context for the memorandum here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.commondreams.org/views/2011/08/25/lewis-powell-memo-corporate-blueprint-dominate-democracy%3famp\n\nLong read open access:\nhttps://scalar.usc.edu/works/growing-apart-a-political-history-of-american-inequality/the-powell-memorandum",

Chile literally just toppled an American placed system this year. Ever hear of School of the Americas? We placed war criminals in to fuck up the third world royally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course EU is similar. Half of them had empires as well and current trends are populist reactions towards migration, which, spoiler alert, are because of imperialist policies and environmental change. Hell, even the new EU climate policy changes are based on off shoring a lot of pollution to these places. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental flaw in these old systems and they need reformed to not be based on exploitation of those at home or abroad. It&amp;#39;s not sustainable and it does not have to be this way. We have a large population now with mass communication and literacy. We can do better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the downdooters: Let me tell you about the Powell Memorandum, the reaction to the formation of the EPA. This shit is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;On August 23, 1971, less than two months before he was nominated to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Lewis F. Powell, Jr. mailed a confidential memorandum to his friend Eugene B. Sydnor, Jr., Chair of the Education Committee of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The memo was titled Attack On American Free Enterprise System and outlined ways in which business should defend and counter attack against a &amp;quot;broad attack&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;disquieting voices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Documents:\n&lt;a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/\"&gt;https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you know what? This is why we are here today, more of the same bullshit. This is why we have the Chamber of Commerce, who&amp;#39;s job is to make government put buisness before people. This is why Fox News exists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you think nearly every major civil rights activist we know as household names identified as a socialist? No one ever talks about it, that&amp;#39;s by design. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More context for the memorandum here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.commondreams.org/views/2011/08/25/lewis-powell-memo-corporate-blueprint-dominate-democracy%3famp\"&gt;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.commondreams.org/views/2011/08/25/lewis-powell-memo-corporate-blueprint-dominate-democracy%3famp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long read open access:\n&lt;a href=\"https://scalar.usc.edu/works/growing-apart-a-political-history-of-american-inequality/the-powell-memorandum\"&gt;https://scalar.usc.edu/works/growing-apart-a-political-history-of-american-inequality/the-powell-memorandum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

They are very different equations.\n\nMorisita is more useful when you have accurate counts with modern data, though it's variant, Horn-Morisita might be used (?), but is not standard.\n\nTo break this down a bit to help explain (and to help me too!):\n\nMorisita:\n\n* Morisita assess the spatial clustering of organisms.\n   * *Morisita's overlap index* is a statistical measure of dispersion of individuals in a population. It is used to compare overlap among samples (Morisita 1959).\n      * This formula is based on the assumption that increasing the size of the samples will increase the diversity because it will include different habitats (i.e. different faunas).\n* Morisita's measure was formulated for counts of *individuals* and not for other measures of usage like proportions or biomass.\n   * If your data are not formulated as numbers of individuals, you can use the next measure of niche overlap, the Simplified Morisita Index, or Horn-Morisita index\n* The Morisita and the Horn-Morisita indices measure the probability that individuals drawn one from each vector will belong to different species, relative to drawing from each vector separately.\n* The Morisita index is formulated for count data only, whereas the Horn-Morisita index can be used with transformed counts or proportions.\n* The Horn-Morisita can also be used to measure niche overlap.\n\nB-C:\n\n* Bray-Curtis is a statistic used to quantify the compositional dissimilarity between two different sites, based on counts at each site.\n* Bray-Curtis, or Polar ordination (PO), begins with the computation of a dissimilarity matrix, then two observations are chosen to serve as \"poles.\"\n   * Ideally, these observations represent opposite ends of an environmental gradient and thus are likely to have the largest, or close to the largest, dissimilarity value.\n* The equation computes ordination scores by projecting observations onto the axis formed by connecting the two endpoints.\n* Observations of similar environmental makeup (or, e.g., species composition) will ordinate near each other.\n* The distance (E) off the axis of a sample entity measures the extent to which the ordination fails to define the location of the entity's position in the multidimensional dissimilarity space and indicates the presence of additional gradients (or stochastic variation).\n   * Large values of E indicate that much of the data structure is not captured by the PO axis and additional axes may be useful.\n\nB-C Pros:\n\n1. Allows you to subjectively determine the ordination gradient making environmental interpretation of the results is relatively direct.\n2. It is very useful when the investigator is specifically interested in the organizationand relationship among entities on a predetermined, well-specified gradient (e.g. transitional gradients along a river).\n3. PO makes no assumption about random sampling and does not require a multivariate normal distribution of points.\n4. PO is unaffected by clusters of observations and outliers, as long as outliers are not selected as endpoints.\n\nB-C Cons:\n\n1. PO is criticized heavily for its subjectivity in assigning endpoints.\n2. PO is subject to serious distortions leading to erroneous conclusions ifo utliers are inadvertently selected as endpoints.\n3. PO axies do not represent true independent relationships.\n4. Last, like PCA, later axes can under certain conditions suffer from the \"arch effect\" and \"compression effect\"  which often limits the use of PO to situations in which only the first polar axis is of interest.\n\nTL;DR  Morisitia measures niche overlap for individual species (*what is there).* It is not great for palaeodata because it is inherently fragmented. B-C measures habitats and asks *what aren't we seeing/how varied is this environment*.\n\nThere is a wide range of different equations to use for things like this depending on your questions, would be better to check with some peers before going gung-ho with one equations as their subtle differences can be a bit confusing. It would help if we knew what question you are asking of the data! For purely biodiversity numbers, I would use another equation altogether (e.g. Rarefaction - see below)!

It seems suited for more chaos brains, hence the messy professor meme. \n\nHere's some resource I pulled together that might help you as you start this. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/nnomadic/comments/jg5k3v/software\\_for\\_working\\_with\\_an\\_adhd\\_brain/](https://www.reddit.com/user/nnomadic/comments/jg5k3v/software_for_working_with_an_adhd_brain/)\n\nI am also going to pm you a guidebook I wish I found before I started my project! You're gonna rock it. I didn't know until my 3rd year I even had ADHD. It was a total game changer. \n\nTime blindness is the biggest issue I've had with the PhD, but you're more aware of it than I was. It's hard not to study all of the things and it is also hard not to get overwhelmed by everything that you need to do. My advisor and I now joke about my rabbit holing and I asked her to let me know when I am letting the drunk little man inside of me steer the brain... These things are not a total loss though, it's actually provided some interesting and innovating results. \n\nMake sure you find a good kind and caring advisor who you get along with emotionally. It's so important, some of the tougher old guards break people and cause them to drop/burn out. There will be times that you feel like you are lost and adrift or doubt your abilities, but even the most normie of students go through that, you kind of get past it though. I have found it to be more of a personal journey than work even in a STEM field.",

It seems suited for more chaos brains, hence the messy professor meme. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some resource I pulled together that might help you as you start this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nnomadic/comments/jg5k3v/software_for_working_with_an_adhd_brain/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/user/nnomadic/comments/jg5k3v/software_for_working_with_an_adhd_brain/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also going to pm you a guidebook I wish I found before I started my project! You&amp;#39;re gonna rock it. I didn&amp;#39;t know until my 3rd year I even had ADHD. It was a total game changer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time blindness is the biggest issue I&amp;#39;ve had with the PhD, but you&amp;#39;re more aware of it than I was. It&amp;#39;s hard not to study all of the things and it is also hard not to get overwhelmed by everything that you need to do. My advisor and I now joke about my rabbit holing and I asked her to let me know when I am letting the drunk little man inside of me steer the brain... These things are not a total loss though, it&amp;#39;s actually provided some interesting and innovating results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure you find a good kind and caring advisor who you get along with emotionally. It&amp;#39;s so important, some of the tougher old guards break people and cause them to drop/burn out. There will be times that you feel like you are lost and adrift or doubt your abilities, but even the most normie of students go through that, you kind of get past it though. I have found it to be more of a personal journey than work even in a STEM field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Hey, I am in my 4th year of my PhD and I literally got diagnosed six months ago. It's really, really hard, but you have the advantage of knowing why this is happening so you can work with it I just posted some advice for another student in this sub, let me shift it to your needs.\n\nI often hit this wall (and often and it's exhausting and soul crushing), there are tools for this. You have the added bonus of dependents which does not help. I cannot emphasise how important for someone in your position to have a strict schedule. My partner and I are both ADHD and here are the tools we use to help:\n\n\\- A shared e-calendar.\n\n\\- White boards beside the front door. (Grocery, calendar, &amp; to do list)\n\n\\- Personal whiteboards (weekly calendar + notes)\n\nYou need to take time on Sundays to plan out your week or you are going to be chasing strings and you need to take a good 5-10 minutes a few times per week to meditate and help focus your brain. This is a skill and it helps just stop the noise.\n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasise how important the medicine is. The side effects are rough but lessen over time the more regularly and \\*scheduled\\* you use them. We set up an alarm 1hr before we have to wake up and I placed a small mini desk fridge beside the bed so that we can roll over, take the meds with a protein or yogurt drink, and go back to sleep and wake up later, medicated without issues.\n\nIf what you are taking is too harsh, call your doctor and tell them exactly what is happening. They may have suggestions for different things to try.\n\nIf you can afford it, find an e-therapist for even 25 minute sessions once per week. You need to schedule self care time, because I know I sure as hell did. I crashed during my 3rd year of my PhD because my outlet, climbing, has been put on hold due to a severe unrelated injury and I no longer had that outlet. I then dove into work and way too much. I became no fun. My partner and I nearly broke up because I became so dysfunctional and work took over so much that I was no longer being actually productive.\n\nAs for writing, which I am sure you are doing a lot of: write in bullet points then organise, and now even better I write first with mind mapping software that I can export into MS Word. (I use Edraw Mindmaster, but there are others), and use a referencer software to avoid last minute scrambles. If you like to tinker, try and automate your processes as much as possible to work around procrastination (e.g. citation generator in reference software).\n\nSomething I also use when I don't feel like I am getting enough done is this app called Toggl, where I can push a play and stop button and categorise what I worked on. At the end of the week I am always quite surprised at how much I did do and it keeps an encouraging loop.\n\nWe need lots of tools to keep ourselves organised and to help us break things down into small baby steps. I made this list for my ADHD partner of tools, and maybe it will help you too.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hatlla/software\\_for\\_working\\_with\\_an\\_adhd\\_brain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hatlla/software_for_working_with_an_adhd_brain/)\n\nWhen we fall off the wagon on using these tools (which happens often, more than I'd like to admit), we can't punish ourselves, but pick up and try again. That makes it easier next time. Something that is good for practicing this skill (and it is a skill) is meditation. Headspace is a great app for this.\n\nIntroducing these small steps over time (not as to overwhelm you at first), does help in the long run. You are in a place for learning and please register with your SpLD team. They can provide you resources, an outlet and also defend you or support you when you really just need an extension.\n\nCommunicate with your professors too, and the earlier the better. Give them a heads up that you struggle with these things and when the time comes they will be a lot more likely to be understanding of these things. Covid has them all under A LOT of pressure right now, transferring their lessons to different formats and covering for people who are high risk (e.g. I have refused to teach in person this semester and I know others who cannot and will not as well).\n\nIf you need any advice or a vent please drop me a pm. Hang in there, you'll get through this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: BTW I am not much younger than you at 30.\n\nAlso here's this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jc0dsv/any\\_app\\_out\\_there\\_that\\_does\\_texttovoice\\_for/g8yu008/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/jc0dsv/any_app_out_there_that_does_texttovoice_for/g8yu008/?context=3)\n\nUse multiple senses when trying to read papers. I know I use captions on the TV to help me pay attention.... 'Work places' are also good for this, but need to be respected as that so when you do sit in that spot your brain says work. I am horrible for this, however.\n\nExpect to fuck up and often, but that's part of what you are there for. You're there to learn not to prove anything. The biggest thing to learn in any grad program is communication skills. :)",

It is the number of people who die from a disease among everyone who has the disease, regardless of the presence of symptoms. Epidemiologists prefer this rate because it includes all people who have the virus -- not just the ones with symptoms -- and is there considered more accurate.\n\n&gt;The problem is, we don't know the true infection fatality ratio in the United States because in many regions, only people with symptoms receive a test. Right now, the CDC's best guess is that the IFR is 0.0065, meaning that fewer than 1% of all people infected with the coronavirus -- regardless of whether they have symptoms -- die from the disease.\n\n&gt;The next best estimate is the case fatality ratio (CFR), a metric that is used often in literature and by the media. This measures the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. In the U.S., confirmed cases generally implies that those individuals had symptoms.\n\n&gt;Right now, the case fatality ratio is 3.6%, meaning that out of every 100 Americans diagnosed with COVID-19, about 3 to 4 are expected to die. By this metric, the U.S. is better off than some hard-hit European countries but worse than many other countries that have more successfully contained the virus and implemented widespread testing.  \n\n&gt;Still, experts warn, it's difficult to use the case fatality ratio to compare countries. \"While a useful measure, we need to be careful in the interpretation of the CFR,\" Brownstein said. \"Differences between countries could be driven by a range of factors including testing capacity, demographic characteristics of the population, and health care system quality and capacity.\"\n\nThere is a huge problem with metrics for both of these measurement as we do not have concrete numbers of what is happening in the USA. We have an idea, but as the article mentions it is not perfect.  \n\nThis article I linked earlier covers excess deaths, an even more robust metric than either ones we just argued.    \n\n&gt;The US has the highest COVID-19-attributed infections and deaths, accounting for 21% of global deaths. Defenders of the US’s pandemic policy record assert that such figures are misleading since reported COVID-19 cases depend on the testing regime and many countries under-count COVID-19-related deaths.   \n\n&gt;Using excess mortality data is a more rigorous way to compare the pandemic’s death toll. Excess mortality counts deaths from all causes relative to what would normally have been expected. This avoids miscounting deaths due to the under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths and other health conditions left untreated, or potentially misattributing deaths to COVID-19 that had other causes. Measures taken by governments and individuals may influence death rates – for example, deaths from traffic accidents may decline but suicide rates may rise. Excess mortality captures the net outcome of all these factors. We show that the P-score – a measure of the rate of excess deaths (actual deaths minus ‘normal’ deaths) relative to normal deaths – is preferable to measuring excess deaths relative to population.   \n\n&gt;...  \n\n&gt;US policymakers had at least four advantages over their European counterparts in countries such as Italy and Spain that should have led to lower excess mortality rates than in Europe:\n\n&gt;First, there was more time to prepare. Genomic evidence suggests that Europe was the source of most infections that became evident in New York in early March. The US administration had three weeks’ more warning given the lag between initial rises in excess mortality in Italy and Spain versus the US Northeast. For the South, West and Midwest (accounting for 83% of the US population), the delayed spread of the virus should have provided an even greater advantage.  \n\n&gt;Second, the US has a younger population4 and COVID-19 mortality is significantly correlated with age.  \n\n&gt;Third,  the US has a lower population density than Europe as a whole and for large conurbations within, and viral spread is greater in more dense populations.5  \n\n&gt;Fourth, the later onset should have enabled US authorities to take advantage of rapidly improving medical knowledge and capacity (the nature of the disease, treatment regimes, testing capacity, and the effectiveness of policies such as social distancing and masks).  \n\n&gt;These multiple advantages should have reduced US excess mortality rates relative to Europe, but instead rates far exceed those of Europe and its countries (see Figure 1).  \n\nSauce: https://voxeu.org/article/us-excess-mortality-rate-covid-19-substantially-worse-europe-s\n\nI'm still going to go with the USA is not doing as well as you think right now as this will compound with later issues of people with unaffordable health issues, economic buffers and grief.

I&amp;#39;m talking way earlier than concepts of the modern state, this is back before there were states. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also you would be interested in the link I posted above.

During 1972–2018, California experienced a fivefold increase in annual burned area, mainly due to more than an eightfold increase in summer forest‐fire extent. Increased summer forest‐fire area very likely occurred due to increased atmospheric aridity caused by warming. Since the early 1970s, warm‐season days warmed by approximately 1.4 °C as part of a centennial warming trend, significantly increasing the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). These trends are consistent with anthropogenic trends simulated by climate models. The response of summer forest‐fire area to VPD is exponential, meaning that warming has grown increasingly impactful. Robust interannual relationships between VPD and summer forest‐fire area strongly suggest that nearly all of the increase in summer forest‐fire area during 1972–2018 was driven by increased VPD. Climate change effects on summer wildfire were less evident in nonforested lands. In fall, wind events and delayed onset of winter precipitation are the dominant promoters of wildfire. While these variables did not change much over the past century, background warming and consequent fuel drying is increasingly enhancing the potential for large fall wildfires. Among the many processes important to California's diverse fire regimes, warming‐driven fuel drying is the clearest link between anthropogenic climate change and increased California wildfire activity to date.  \n\nFuture predictions on wildfire in California: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-007-9363-z  \nIncorporating Anthropogenic Influences into Fire Probability Models: Effects of Human Activity and Climate Change on Fire Activity in California: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153589\n\nPeer review, with some minor criticisms of the effects of climate change: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39284-1  (quoted below)\n\n&gt;Our results demonstrate that after correcting for potential over-estimates of the effects of climate-driven increases in area burned, California is likely to continue facing significant wildfire and air quality challenges with on-going climate change.\n\nGuidance from California:  \nWILDFIRE SIMULATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT: PROJECTING CHANGES IN EXTREME WILDFIRE EVENTS WITH A WARMING CLIMATE  http://ibecproject.com/PREDEIR_0002479.pdf  \n\nLook, I realise that this is very political in America, but Science says:  \n&gt;Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree*: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.  \n&gt;....  \n&gt;*Technically, a “consensus” is a general agreement of opinion, but the scientific method steers us away from this to an objective framework. In science, facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis (a statement of a possible explanation for some natural phenomenon), which can then be tested and retested until it is refuted (or disproved).  \n\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/  \n\nThe observed effects are there and thus action needs to be taken on both management practices and climate change.\n\nEdit: Almost forgot: Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770  \n\nI'm not one of those collapse types.

Among the many processes important to California&amp;#39;s diverse fire regimes, warming‐driven fuel drying is the clearest link between anthropogenic climate change and increased California wildfire activity to date.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Future predictions on wildfire in California: &lt;a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-007-9363-z\"&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-007-9363-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nIncorporating Anthropogenic Influences into Fire Probability Models: Effects of Human Activity and Climate Change on Fire Activity in California: &lt;a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153589\"&gt;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153589&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peer review, with some minor criticisms of the effects of climate change: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39284-1\"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39284-1&lt;/a&gt;  (quoted below)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that after correcting for potential over-estimates of the effects of climate-driven increases in area burned, California is likely to continue facing significant wildfire and air quality challenges with on-going climate change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guidance from California:&lt;br/&gt;\nWILDFIRE SIMULATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA&amp;#39;S FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT: PROJECTING CHANGES IN EXTREME WILDFIRE EVENTS WITH A WARMING CLIMATE  &lt;a href=\"http://ibecproject.com/PREDEIR_0002479.pdf\"&gt;http://ibecproject.com/PREDEIR_0002479.pdf&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I realise that this is very political in America, but Science says:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree*: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.&lt;br/&gt;\n....&lt;br/&gt;\n*Technically, a “consensus” is a general agreement of opinion, but the scientific method steers us away from this to an objective framework. In science, facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis (a statement of a possible explanation for some natural phenomenon), which can then be tested and retested until it is refuted (or disproved).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/\"&gt;https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The observed effects are there and thus action needs to be taken on both management practices and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Almost forgot: Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770\"&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not one of those collapse types.

The earth is a system of systems and we are not so separate as we often like to think...\n\nBiogeography is a subdiscipline of physical geography. Here is a quick bit from the wiki:\n\n&gt;Knowledge of spatial variation in the numbers and types of organisms is as vital to us today as it was to our early human [ancestors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestors), as we adapt to heterogeneous but geographically predictable [environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment). Biogeography is an integrative field of inquiry that unites concepts and information from [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology), [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology), [taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)), [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology), [physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography), [palaeontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeontology), and [climatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A biogeographer's main focus is on how the environment and humans affect the distribution of species as well as other manifestations of Life such as species or genetic diversity.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography)\n\nPersonally, I think leaving out the human aspects takes away a huge piece of this puzzle, especially considering modern conditions. Here in the UK, geoarchaeology, for example, is also taught in physical geography modules and many of us are in these departments. Human population distribution borders on Human Geography (perhaps a tag would be good?), but nevertheless, has to be considered when analysing why things came to be as they are today.\n\nJust my 2 cents. I post what I find interesting and would welcome other posters. My posts are to encourage more discourse in the hopes that others partake as well. :)\n\ntl;dr going for a holistic approach; physical geography is a giant umbrella and more communications between the moving parts is desperately needed.\n\nEdit:\n\nCompare the overlaps here:\n\nHuman Geography perspective: [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B4diAUN9174/VA8Cz7KAhCI/AAAAAAAAAWw/MHcZlzY4zwE/s1600/humangeog.jpg](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B4diAUN9174/VA8Cz7KAhCI/AAAAAAAAAWw/MHcZlzY4zwE/s1600/humangeog.jpg)\n\nPhysical Geography/Earth Systems Perspective: [http://www.virtualfieldwork.org/Rainbow\\_Charts.html](http://www.virtualfieldwork.org/Rainbow_Charts.html)",

The earth is a system of systems and we are not so separate as we often like to think...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Biogeography is a subdiscipline of physical geography. Here is a quick bit from the wiki:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of spatial variation in the numbers and types of organisms is as vital to us today as it was to our early human &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestors\"&gt;ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, as we adapt to heterogeneous but geographically predictable &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment\"&gt;environments&lt;/a&gt;. Biogeography is an integrative field of inquiry that unites concepts and information from &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology\"&gt;ecology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology\"&gt;evolutionary biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography\"&gt;physical geography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeontology\"&gt;palaeontology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology\"&gt;climatology&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A biogeographer&amp;#39;s main focus is on how the environment and humans affect the distribution of species as well as other manifestations of Life such as species or genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think leaving out the human aspects takes away a huge piece of this puzzle, especially considering modern conditions. Here in the UK, geoarchaeology, for example, is also taught in physical geography modules and many of us are in these departments. Human population distribution borders on Human Geography (perhaps a tag would be good?), but nevertheless, has to be considered when analysing why things came to be as they are today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just my 2 cents. I post what I find interesting and would welcome other posters. My posts are to encourage more discourse in the hopes that others partake as well. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr going for a holistic approach; physical geography is a giant umbrella and more communications between the moving parts is desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compare the overlaps here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Human Geography perspective: &lt;a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B4diAUN9174/VA8Cz7KAhCI/AAAAAAAAAWw/MHcZlzY4zwE/s1600/humangeog.jpg\"&gt;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B4diAUN9174/VA8Cz7KAhCI/AAAAAAAAAWw/MHcZlzY4zwE/s1600/humangeog.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physical Geography/Earth Systems Perspective: &lt;a href=\"http://www.virtualfieldwork.org/Rainbow_Charts.html\"&gt;http://www.virtualfieldwork.org/Rainbow_Charts.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You got an already weak system being exposed to unusual conditions, creating the perfect storm for poor management practices to reek havoc to their full potential. Things that would normally survive and recover, can&amp;#39;t due to both fire and climate conditions, making the system even weaker the next time it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "&gt;A quote that's now contradicting you (and frankly inaccurate), you recognize land management is an issue, but then they don't, and claim climate change is THE (not one of, but THE) cause.\n\nIt's more than one cause. It's both! It's not so black and white! The author is generalising the results. The decrease, he is directly correlating to the increase in managed farmland. This is different from the situation in California, a poorly managed woodland stressed from climatic changes.\n\n&gt;You do realize there are only two things that influence wild fires right? Precipitation and Evaporation are the only two climate related phenomenon that impact fires.\n\nThis is not true! Ecology has massive effects on wildfires. This is based on the idea of forest degradation. Almost every year, forests fires are witnessed across different forest regions which persistently reduce the quality of certain forest features like soil fertility, biodiversity, and ecosystems. We need fire, don't get me wrong. I think you may have misunderstood that. This is how ecology affects fires and vice versa:\n\n&gt;Forest fires are a natural and necessary part of the ecosystem. Even healthy forests contain dead trees and decaying plant matter; when a fire turns them to ashes, nutrients return to the soil instead of remaining captive in old vegetation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And, when fire rages through dry underbrush, it clears thick growth so sunlight can reach the forest floor and encourage the growth of native species. Fire frees these plants from the competition delivered by invasive weeds and eliminates diseases or droves of insects that may have been causing damage to old growth. Wildflowers begin to bloom abundantly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most young, healthy trees are resilient enough to survive a forest fire and will soon have a growth spurt, thanks to flames that thin light-banning canopies above \\[source: National Geographic\\]. And scientists report young-growth forests recovering from fire are home to more diverse species, in both plants and animals. This is because the remnants of burned trees offer attractive habitats to birds and small mammals, and nutrients from burned vegetation continue to leach into the soil to fuel the birth of new plants.\n\n[https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/how-forest-fire-benefit-living-things-2.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/how-forest-fire-benefit-living-things-2.htm)\n\nThe problem is when you have these massive fires, they kill the stuff that was supposed to make it through to recover these systems, making the situation worse. Young patches of woodland can no longer persist through them.\n\nThese environmental changes create more climate change in the long run, affecting other areas exponentially. We have changed the earth drastically in the last 30 years, and there is a 40 year lag with a lot of climatic affects to these changes.\n\n[https://skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html](https://skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)\n\nNot only that,  different trees and shrubs have different levels of flammability and rates of consumption.\n\n&gt;First of all I don't even know what \"weaker environments\" means. Please clarify this, because as far as I know environmental changes simply shift where organisms can live, it doesn't change the fitness of said organisms to live in an environment.\n\nThis is what I mentioned above. Forest degradation.\n\nIn California:\n\n&gt;The 2012–2015 drought has left California with severely reduced snowpack, soil moisture, ground water, and reservoir stocks, but the impact of this estimated millennial-scale event on forest health is unknown. We used airborne laser-guided spectroscopy and satellite-based models to assess losses in canopy water content of California’s forests between 2011 and 2015. Approximately 10.6 million ha of forest containing up to 888 million large trees experienced measurable loss in canopy water content during this drought period. Severe canopy water losses of greater than 30% occurred over 1 million ha, affecting up to 58 million large trees. Our measurements exclude forests affected by fire between 2011 and 2015. If drought conditions continue or reoccur, even with temporary reprieves such as El Niño, we predict substantial future forest change.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/E249.short](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/E249.short)\n\nMore management info on this trend:\n\n[https://www.conservationgateway.org/Documents/The%20Hidden%20Frontier%20of%20Forest%20Degradation.pdf](https://www.conservationgateway.org/Documents/The%20Hidden%20Frontier%20of%20Forest%20Degradation.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And I provided data for precipitation, there's literally no upward or downward trend in precipitation on a month by month basis. Perhaps El ninos and la ninas will become more prominent, but I don't see that in the data either.\n\n[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ca.pdf](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ca.pdf)\n\nAgain, you can't only look at precipitation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And no, woodlands in the west NEED fire, they evolved to not only survive it but THRIVE AND DEPEND ON IT. We do not want less fires, that's what's causing all these problems to begin with.\n\nThis was never an argument.\n\n&gt;[https://statesummaries.ncics.org/chapter/fl/](https://statesummaries.ncics.org/chapter/fl/)\n\nFrom your link it says directly beneath that graph:\n\n&gt;Florida has experienced below average precipitation in the last decade (2005–2014) characterized by a simultaneous increase in the occurrence of drought and wild fires.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Have you ever considered that I never once claimed that climate change does not affect California? Have you also considered the planet is homogenous and climate change isn't a monolithic term, but rather an umbrella term referring to different changes in weather patterns. Climate change in California is much different than climate change in Uganda, and no, Climate Change is not synonymous with the word bad.\n\nI never said climate change itself is a bad thing. I am saying the current iteration of climate change, which is 100% anthropogenically influenced is bad because of the velocity of change. This rate of change is much faster than anything the earth has experienced in the last 300 million years and the plants and animals that live here have evolved to those rates.\n\nThe earth is a system of systems and each of these parts are gears. When you change one of these things, it will affect the others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In California's case there is little to no change in precipitation, evaporation has increased, meaning there's more time for fires to burn land, but that does not have any meaningful impact on the size of fires. A 5% change in how much water evaporates over the course of 100 years does not cause small fires to become less common while making large fires increase in frequency. Again, there's no mechanism in nature that could even remotely drive this.\n\nWater evaporation rates affect the ecology within the land, creating vulnerable ecological, water stressed environments. These changes, even so slow, do affect these things. That change is a lot faster than these flora have evolved to deal with. The nature link I posted earlier goes into effects of velocity in a lot more detail.\n\n&gt;Except future changes aren't relevant to what happening NOW or what HAS happened.",

        "body": "Global fires are decreasing, this is interesting! I am learning too, and these conversations help. This is why I am on here, and to become a better conversationalist.\n\nI found another link to that study that gives a better story: [https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145421/building-a-long-term-record-](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145421/building-a-long-term-record-of-fire) the author gives the caveat that:\n\n&gt;One of the most interesting things researchers have discovered since MODIS began collecting measurements, noted Randerson, is a [decrease](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/90493/researchers-detect-a-global-drop-in-fires) in the total number of square kilometers burned each year. Between 2003 and 2019, that number has dropped by roughly 25 percent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As populations have increased in fire-prone regions of Africa, South America, and Central Asia, grasslands and savannas have become more developed and converted into farmland. As a result, long-standing habits of burning grasslands (to clear shrubs and land for cattle or other reasons) have decreased, explained NASA Goddard Space Flight scientist [Niels Andela](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/niels.andela).

        "body": "Please refrain from using the word 'bud,' it comes off as rude. This is a place for learning, not this. See rules on the side.\n\n&gt;Bud, I know that If transpiration increases fuel availability will increase as well, but you also need to realize that that increase in fuel availability happens over the course of a century, while fires occur annually.    \n\n&gt;This means that fuel load would be burned slowly over the course of decades. What this would cause is an increase in burn area, hence why is stated that grasslands would expand (perhaps you should read my comment before responding).  \n\n&gt;But this increase in transpiration will NOT increase the size, intensity, or temperature of fires like we've seen. There's no mechanism in nature to allow such an increase to occur, while small fires become substantially less frequent.  \n\nI was not arguing this and I am fully aware of this mechanism, but there is more nuance to this. You cannot blame just one side or the other. And why does this come down a need to blame one side? Both will need to be addressed in the coming decades in order to mitigate these events.    \n\n&gt;We can tell it is the fault of land management because this issue didn't occur when precipitation in the west plummeted during the early 1900s, we didn't see this issue in the central western U.S. when massive heat waves tore through the area, we didn't see this problem start to occur until the 1950s, after the planet had already warmed 1-1.5°C from 1750.  \n\nWhat you are missing here is not the issue that these megafires were initially caused by land management, of course that is the case, no one is arguing that at all. What the issue is, is that climate is changing globally and this is only going to get worse.   \n\n&gt;Florida actually suffered from the same issue as California for a time.  \n\n&gt;Poor land management and fire suppression caused Florida's forest to over grow and get burdened with copious amounts of litter.  \n\n&gt;By the 1990s this got so bad that a fire started on Florida's east coast in-between Jacksonville and Daytona, and the fire burned 500,000 acres of land.  \n\n&gt;Since then Florida's has taken over fire management from the federal level for the most part, and while fires have become more frequent, Florida no longer sees mega fires like it used to, in a bad year a fire might burn 5,000 acres now.  \n\n&gt;And it's not like Florida's climate is in a different boat, much like California Florida has seen little to no change in it's precipitation for the last century while temperatures have increased.  \n\nAgain, no one is arguing land management as a cause. California precipitation is changing and so is Florida's.... This last sentence is inaccurate.   \n\nCalifornia: \nhttps://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/future-extreme-precipitation-california/\n\n&gt;Climate change promises to make managing California’s water even more challenging. Projections from global climate models — the computer simulation tools that inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scientific assessments — lead us to expect that future precipitation in California will change. However, it’s unlikely the biggest change will be in overall amount of precipitation the state gets. Instead, it’s currently thought the character of precipitation will probably change, with more intense atmospheric rivers and longer dry spells between them. In other words, California’s already variable climate may become even more extreme.  \n\nFlorida: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Florida#Impact_of_climate_change_on_Florida_hurricanes  \n\nThis comes down to a matter of ecology and the rate of change. The problem with today's version of climate change is not simply that the climate is changing. It's the velocity of it:\n\n&gt;Today's global warming is happening at a much faster rate today it did in the warm periods between ice ages over the last million years. The transition from the last ice age to the current interglacial period is estimated to have spanned 5,000 years. Humans could witness the same magnitude of global warming within a span of about 110 years. In other words, if our world warms by as much as 7°F (4.1°C) from 1990 to 2100, as some climate models project could happen, then that warming rate is about 45 times faster than the warming Earth experienced when it emerged from the last ice age.  \n\nhttps://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/how-current-global-warming-trend-different-previous-warming-periods-earths  \n\nPlants can only migrate, reproduce and evolve at certain rather fixed rates and this warming is happening too fast for them to keep up. Changes, even like the ones listed above have big consequences on a plant's ability to reproduce and survive. They won't if conditions aren't right. This creates ecosystems which are fragile  to outside threats and would struggle to recover.  \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/velocity-climate-change/  \n\nStudy: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08649  \n\nThis is a good explainer of the relationships (sorry forgot to add, meant to): https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-climate-change-is-affecting-wildfires-around-the-world  \n\n&gt;And bud, this isn't a global occurence, NASA has data on this if your curious, Globally fire burn areas have been in a decline for decades now.\n\nAgain, this is untrue. I would like to see your sources for this information. As quoted above:\n\n&gt;Climate scientists have correlated the growing incidence and intensity of wildfires with rising global temperatures. Few places seem immune: Australia; Indonesia; Canada; Alaska; the American northwest, southwest and southeast; Chile; and Western Europe have all seen massive and destructive wildfires in recent years. In federally managed forests in the western U.S. today, wildfires larger than 1,000 acres have become nearly five times more frequent and burned areas 10 times as large as in the 1970s, according to research by LeRoy Westerling at the University of California at Merced.

See rules on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bud, I know that If transpiration increases fuel availability will increase as well, but you also need to realize that that increase in fuel availability happens over the course of a century, while fires occur annually.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that fuel load would be burned slowly over the course of decades. What this would cause is an increase in burn area, hence why is stated that grasslands would expand (perhaps you should read my comment before responding).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this increase in transpiration will NOT increase the size, intensity, or temperature of fires like we&amp;#39;ve seen. There&amp;#39;s no mechanism in nature to allow such an increase to occur, while small fires become substantially less frequent.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was not arguing this and I am fully aware of this mechanism, but there is more nuance to this. You cannot blame just one side or the other. And why does this come down a need to blame one side? Both will need to be addressed in the coming decades in order to mitigate these events.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can tell it is the fault of land management because this issue didn&amp;#39;t occur when precipitation in the west plummeted during the early 1900s, we didn&amp;#39;t see this issue in the central western U.S. when massive heat waves tore through the area, we didn&amp;#39;t see this problem start to occur until the 1950s, after the planet had already warmed 1-1.5°C from 1750.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you are missing here is not the issue that these megafires were initially caused by land management, of course that is the case, no one is arguing that at all. What the issue is, is that climate is changing globally and this is only going to get worse.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Florida actually suffered from the same issue as California for a time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor land management and fire suppression caused Florida&amp;#39;s forest to over grow and get burdened with copious amounts of litter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the 1990s this got so bad that a fire started on Florida&amp;#39;s east coast in-between Jacksonville and Daytona, and the fire burned 500,000 acres of land.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then Florida&amp;#39;s has taken over fire management from the federal level for the most part, and while fires have become more frequent, Florida no longer sees mega fires like it used to, in a bad year a fire might burn 5,000 acres now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not like Florida&amp;#39;s climate is in a different boat, much like California Florida has seen little to no change in it&amp;#39;s precipitation for the last century while temperatures have increased.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, no one is arguing land management as a cause. California precipitation is changing and so is Florida&amp;#39;s.... This last sentence is inaccurate.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;California: \n&lt;a href=\"https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/future-extreme-precipitation-california/\"&gt;https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/future-extreme-precipitation-california/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Climate change promises to make managing California’s water even more challenging. Projections from global climate models — the computer simulation tools that inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scientific assessments — lead us to expect that future precipitation in California will change. However, it’s unlikely the biggest change will be in overall amount of precipitation the state gets. Instead, it’s currently thought the character of precipitation will probably change, with more intense atmospheric rivers and longer dry spells between them. In other words, California’s already variable climate may become even more extreme.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florida: &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Florida#Impact_of_climate_change_on_Florida_hurricanes\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Florida#Impact_of_climate_change_on_Florida_hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This comes down to a matter of ecology and the rate of change. The problem with today&amp;#39;s version of climate change is not simply that the climate is changing. It&amp;#39;s the velocity of it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s global warming is happening at a much faster rate today it did in the warm periods between ice ages over the last million years. The transition from the last ice age to the current interglacial period is estimated to have spanned 5,000 years. Humans could witness the same magnitude of global warming within a span of about 110 years. In other words, if our world warms by as much as 7°F (4.1°C) from 1990 to 2100, as some climate models project could happen, then that warming rate is about 45 times faster than the warming Earth experienced when it emerged from the last ice age.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/how-current-global-warming-trend-different-previous-warming-periods-earths\"&gt;https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/how-current-global-warming-trend-different-previous-warming-periods-earths&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plants can only migrate, reproduce and evolve at certain rather fixed rates and this warming is happening too fast for them to keep up. Changes, even like the ones listed above have big consequences on a plant&amp;#39;s ability to reproduce and survive. They won&amp;#39;t if conditions aren&amp;#39;t right. This creates ecosystems which are fragile  to outside threats and would struggle to recover.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/velocity-climate-change/\"&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/velocity-climate-change/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08649\"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08649&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a good explainer of the relationships (sorry forgot to add, meant to): &lt;a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-climate-change-is-affecting-wildfires-around-the-world\"&gt;https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-climate-change-is-affecting-wildfires-around-the-world&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And bud, this isn&amp;#39;t a global occurence, NASA has data on this if your curious, Globally fire burn areas have been in a decline for decades now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, this is untrue. I would like to see your sources for this information. As quoted above:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists have correlated the growing incidence and intensity of wildfires with rising global temperatures. Few places seem immune: Australia; Indonesia; Canada; Alaska; the American northwest, southwest and southeast; Chile; and Western Europe have all seen massive and destructive wildfires in recent years. In federally managed forests in the western U.S. today, wildfires larger than 1,000 acres have become nearly five times more frequent and burned areas 10 times as large as in the 1970s, according to research by LeRoy Westerling at the University of California at Merced. This time period corresponds to significant warming documented around the globe: Two-thirds of the 1.4-degree rise in average global temperatures since 1880 has occurred since 1975, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/wildfires.html\"&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/wildfires.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of Australia, it is also in a different boat than the western U.S., unlike the west, Australia&amp;#39;s climate, specifically in the southern portions from Perth to Sydney, is getting drier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the issue of fires in the Blue Mountains bus still much the same as in the western U.S., poor land management, Australia suffers from the same poor land management practices as America for the most part (I would suggest you also read through their practices before responding again).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just contradicted yourself there...

Fire regimes range from being limited by climate (i.e., flammability of fuel) to being limited by fuel availability.  \n\n&gt;In climate-limited systems, there is typically enough fuel for fire to spread, but moisture is too high; these systems are characterized by large infrequent fires, which historically only occurred during climate extremes. However, warming is lengthening growing seasons across the western U.S.,  promoting plant water stress, and increasing fuel aridity. This leads to larger and more severe fires, particularly in climate-limited systems where fuels are abundant. In highly climate-limited systems, management strategies are not always straightforward because forests are not especially receptive to direct fuel manipulation. Recommendations include: “fire-use strategies” that allow natural wildfires to burn, encouraging forest resilience by reducing stressors, and using post-fire conditions to implement adaptation.  \n\n&gt;Over the last decade, a global satellite-based record of fire activity has enabled fire scientists to make major progress in understanding climate–fire relationships. We know that at large scales (e.g., across the western U.S.), there is a clear link between climate warming and increases in area burned.  \n\n&gt;In fuel-limited systems, the climate is relatively arid and conducive to fire, so fire activity is mostly driven by the amount of live and dead plant material present; these systems typically experience frequent, low-severity fires. In many fuel-limited regions (such as in southwestern Ponderosa Pine forests), extensive 20th-century fire suppression has led to overstocked forests, accumulation of dead materials, and ladder fuels that propagate fires into the forest canopy, making them larger and more destructive. In these forests, fuel management such as controlled burns and thinning can help restore resilient forest structure.  \n\n&gt;However, many ecosystems fall at intermediate positions along this climate to fuel-limitation continuum, and it remains unclear how climate change and historical fire suppression have contributed to the changes in fire activity that we are seeing at local scales (e.g., where management is implemented). In some regions, climate change is projected to push fire regimes from climate to fuel-limited. Ongoing research in the Hanan Fire &amp; Dryland Ecosystems Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno suggests that some Northern Rocky locations are just beginning to see such a shift.\n\nAnd these shifts in temperature have massive consequences:  \nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/iois-0oa091620.php\n\nAnd these wildfires are not just happening in America:    \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/climate/wildfires-globally.html\n\n&gt;Climate scientists have correlated the growing incidence and intensity of wildfires with rising global temperatures. Few places seem immune: Australia; Indonesia; Canada; Alaska; the American northwest, southwest and southeast; Chile; and Western Europe have all seen massive and destructive wildfires in recent years. In federally managed forests in the western U.S. today, wildfires larger than 1,000 acres have become nearly five times more frequent and burned areas 10 times as large as in the 1970s, according to research by LeRoy Westerling at the University of California at Merced. This time period corresponds to significant warming documented around the globe: Two-thirds of the 1.4-degree rise in average global temperatures since 1880 has occurred since 1975, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.\n\nSource: https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/wildfires.html\n\nFires have increased globally, last year we were up 5x:\nhttps://phys.org/news/2019-10-earth-wildfires-year.html\n\nWhen you play the blame game everyone loses, We need solutions for both. These causes do not act in isolation and we cannot keep pretending they are. Management set the setting and climate made it much worse.\n\n&gt;For an ignition to grow into a catastrophic megafire, climate and fuel conditions have to be right. For example, one reason the 2020 California lightning complexes spread so explosively is because high-density lightning strikes coincided with extreme temperatures and dry fuels. California’s fuel landscape has also been modified by the 2012-2016 drought (driven in part by climate change), which caused widespread forest mortality and left more than 100 million dead trees on the landscape. Drought mortality is confounded by forest health issues, including beetle and pathogen outbreaks, which are themselves exacerbated by climate change. In the Sierra Nevada, these conditions have combined with wind events, warming, and fuel accumulation (due to fire suppression) to enable lightning and human-caused ignitions to grow into massive wildfires.  \n\n&gt;Fire regimes vary across the western U.S. As a result, plants have a variety of fire adaptations depending on which fire regime they evolved under. Problems arise when fire regimes are pushed outside their historical range of variability–that can mean more frequent fire in climate-limited systems that typically experience infrequent, high severity fires (e.g., lodgepole pine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) or more severe fire in fuel-limited systems that are adapted to frequent, low severity fire (e.g., southwestern Ponderosa Pine forests and yellow pine and mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada).   \n\n&gt;Our ability to mitigate the risks associated with extreme fires, and their effects on communities, lives, and the environment, depends in part on why these fires are increasing in the first place. The underlying causes of wildfire cannot be reduced to a simplistic dichotomy between climate change and management. Solutions to the growing wildfire problem must be multifaceted and location-based. They must include an aggressive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, ecologically appropriate fuel management that incorporates indigenous knowledge, consideration of local communities and resources, and strategies for living with fire.",

Ongoing research in the Hanan Fire &amp;amp; Dryland Ecosystems Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno suggests that some Northern Rocky locations are just beginning to see such a shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And these shifts in temperature have massive consequences:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/iois-0oa091620.php\"&gt;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/iois-0oa091620.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And these wildfires are not just happening in America:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/climate/wildfires-globally.html\"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/climate/wildfires-globally.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Climate scientists have correlated the growing incidence and intensity of wildfires with rising global temperatures. Few places seem immune: Australia; Indonesia; Canada; Alaska; the American northwest, southwest and southeast; Chile; and Western Europe have all seen massive and destructive wildfires in recent years. In federally managed forests in the western U.S. today, wildfires larger than 1,000 acres have become nearly five times more frequent and burned areas 10 times as large as in the 1970s, according to research by LeRoy Westerling at the University of California at Merced. This time period corresponds to significant warming documented around the globe: Two-thirds of the 1.4-degree rise in average global temperatures since 1880 has occurred since 1975, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/wildfires.html\"&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/wildfires.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fires have increased globally, last year we were up 5x:\n&lt;a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-10-earth-wildfires-year.html\"&gt;https://phys.org/news/2019-10-earth-wildfires-year.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you play the blame game everyone loses, We need solutions for both. These causes do not act in isolation and we cannot keep pretending they are. Management set the setting and climate made it much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For an ignition to grow into a catastrophic megafire, climate and fuel conditions have to be right. For example, one reason the 2020 California lightning complexes spread so explosively is because high-density lightning strikes coincided with extreme temperatures and dry fuels. California’s fuel landscape has also been modified by the 2012-2016 drought (driven in part by climate change), which caused widespread forest mortality and left more than 100 million dead trees on the landscape. Drought mortality is confounded by forest health issues, including beetle and pathogen outbreaks, which are themselves exacerbated by climate change. In the Sierra Nevada, these conditions have combined with wind events, warming, and fuel accumulation (due to fire suppression) to enable lightning and human-caused ignitions to grow into massive wildfires.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fire regimes vary across the western U.S. As a result, plants have a variety of fire adaptations depending on which fire regime they evolved under. Problems arise when fire regimes are pushed outside their historical range of variability–that can mean more frequent fire in climate-limited systems that typically experience infrequent, high severity fires (e.g., lodgepole pine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) or more severe fire in fuel-limited systems that are adapted to frequent, low severity fire (e.g., southwestern Ponderosa Pine forests and yellow pine and mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada).   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our ability to mitigate the risks associated with extreme fires, and their effects on communities, lives, and the environment, depends in part on why these fires are increasing in the first place. The underlying causes of wildfire cannot be reduced to a simplistic dichotomy between climate change and management. Solutions to the growing wildfire problem must be multifaceted and location-based. They must include an aggressive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, ecologically appropriate fuel management that incorporates indigenous knowledge, consideration of local communities and resources, and strategies for living with fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We went private for ADHD here, and it sounds like the process is fairly similar, but fortunately we are in a good place to be able to do that. \n\nMy gp has treated myself for depression before (pre-ADHD diagnosis) and it was no trouble trying different things. We are going to start there, then go from there. He is already in CBT, but needs help with managing symptoms. I was wondering if there was something more to it (a better route?), but I guess I was overthinking it.\n\nMental healthcare is rough because it affects literally everything.

I am so thankful to the NHS right now otherwise I would be totally crippled right now physically and mentally. It does have it&amp;#39;s downsides but it could be far worse. We went private for ADHD here, and it sounds like the process is fairly similar, but fortunately we are in a good place to be able to do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My gp has treated myself for depression before (pre-ADHD diagnosis) and it was no trouble trying different things. We are going to start there, then go from there. He is already in CBT, but needs help with managing symptoms. I was wondering if there was something more to it (a better route?), but I guess I was overthinking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mental healthcare is rough because it affects literally everything.
