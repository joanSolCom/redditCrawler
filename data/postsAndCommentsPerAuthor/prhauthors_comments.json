It was so great to go to readings and meet them, some brought their own files, for some I was able to share my research. And it wasn&amp;#39;t just relatives of the D-Day Girls, but of other agents too, so I learned a lot more about family lore, how agents felt about Buckmaster. (There was a lot of anger) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got a letter from baby Claudine -- that was pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Also, this was 2015 and I knew that as of January 1, 2016, the US armed forces would be fully integrated for women in combat roles. So I was reading about women in Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, interviewing members of the military, digging in, when I wondered to myself: who was the first woman in combat? There's always a FIRST for everything. After a little more digging I realized that the 39 women of SOE were the first mobilized force of women in war -- and largely they had been forgotten about in that context. \n\nThere have been women in combat from time immemorial -- Joan of Arc! -- and several women who went to war dressed as a man, but by way of recruitment, answering to command and control, in uniform, organized, in war \\*AS\\* women, the women of SOE tie with Soviet women on the Eastern front for the very first unit. \n\nSo, they were the first women in combat AND they fought Nazis AND they were from Churchill's pet agency...the story announced itself at that point.",

Also, this was 2015 and I knew that as of January 1, 2016, the US armed forces would be fully integrated for women in combat roles. So I was reading about women in Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, interviewing members of the military, digging in, when I wondered to myself: who was the first woman in combat? There&amp;#39;s always a FIRST for everything. After a little more digging I realized that the 39 women of SOE were the first mobilized force of women in war -- and largely they had been forgotten about in that context. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been women in combat from time immemorial -- Joan of Arc! -- and several women who went to war dressed as a man, but by way of recruitment, answering to command and control, in uniform, organized, in war *AS* women, the women of SOE tie with Soviet women on the Eastern front for the very first unit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, they were the first women in combat AND they fought Nazis AND they were from Churchill&amp;#39;s pet agency...the story announced itself at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

With the UAE’s Hope orbiter, which launched a few days ago, we’ll get some incredible measurements of the global Martian atmosphere. Late last night (here on the East Coast at least!), China launched an orbiter, a lander, *and* a rover. If all three work, it will be an incredible feat, and will mean a lot of data about Mars! For a scientist, there is nothing better than data. And of course I’m tremendously excited about NASA’s Perseverance rover, which will launch as soon as a week from today. Perseverance is kicking off a breathtakingly ambitious campaign to cache samples and bring them back to Earth. The rover will touch down in a place called Jezero Crater, where there is an exquisitely preserved river delta that may preserve ancient biosignatures, or ancient traces of life. After two years in Jezero, the plan is for Perseverance to continue up and over the crater’s rim, and hopefully make it far enough to explore a place called Midway. I’m especially excited about the terrain at Midway because it may harbor very different kinds of biosignatures, including those that might have been preserved in the subsurface. \n\nLooking forward to 2022, there is also a European mission in the works called ExoMars that will be carrying the Rosalind Franklin rover, which will be able to drill down two meters under the rover. That’s much farther down than we’ve looked before, and it will allow us to study territory that is sheltered from the planet’s punishing radiation environment. So that’s also a very exciting mission to keep an eye on.",

It was crazy-making at first, trying to put together a whole picture when what the archives provided was barely swiss cheese.  Ultimately I realized that was in fact my job -- to see all the dead ends and write it as if they all made sense, as if it were one coherent narrative. A novelist could just fill in the blanks, but a historian, a reporter, can only work with what is there.  And in the end, that's what I love about this job. \n\nIf I could have one mystery solved...golly...maybe I'm a historical fatalist? Or a completist. I am happy with the book as it stands. The questions don't dog me, now that I've put down my pen, now that I can see the story as written with what I had at hand. \n\nIt's not a mystery, but if I could just stumble on a box full of new information, I think it would be more about Andree's inner life. Aside from her prison letters, everything we have is second hand, other people's impressions, and there's very little even at that. I felt I really knew Odette and Lise from the wealth of first person material, with Andree I had to craft a character with very few handholds. I hope I did her justice. Everything I knew about her went into the book.",

It was crazy-making at first, trying to put together a whole picture when what the archives provided was barely swiss cheese.  Ultimately I realized that was in fact my job -- to see all the dead ends and write it as if they all made sense, as if it were one coherent narrative. A novelist could just fill in the blanks, but a historian, a reporter, can only work with what is there.  And in the end, that&amp;#39;s what I love about this job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I could have one mystery solved...golly...maybe I&amp;#39;m a historical fatalist? Or a completist. I am happy with the book as it stands. The questions don&amp;#39;t dog me, now that I&amp;#39;ve put down my pen, now that I can see the story as written with what I had at hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a mystery, but if I could just stumble on a box full of new information, I think it would be more about Andree&amp;#39;s inner life. Aside from her prison letters, everything we have is second hand, other people&amp;#39;s impressions, and there&amp;#39;s very little even at that. I felt I really knew Odette and Lise from the wealth of first person material, with Andree I had to craft a character with very few handholds. I hope I did her justice. Everything I knew about her went into the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Thank you! The missions this year are really exciting. With the UAE’s Hope orbiter, which launched a few days ago, we’ll get some incredible measurements of the global Martian atmosphere. Late last night (here on the East Coast at least!), China launched an orbiter, a lander, *and* a rover. If all three work, it will be an incredible feat, and will mean a lot of data about Mars! For a scientist, there is nothing better than data. And of course I’m tremendously excited about NASA’s Perseverance rover, which will launch as soon as a week from today. Perseverance is kicking off a breathtakingly ambitious campaign to cache samples and bring them back to Earth. The rover will touch down in a place called Jezero Crater, where there is an exquisitely preserved river delta that may preserve ancient biosignatures, or ancient traces of life. After two years in Jezero, the plan is for Perseverance to continue up and over the crater’s rim, and hopefully make it far enough to explore a place called Midway. I’m especially excited about the terrain at Midway because it may harbor very different kinds of biosignatures, including those that might have been preserved in the subsurface. \n\nLooking forward to 2022, there is also a European mission in the works called ExoMars that will be carrying the Rosalind Franklin rover, which will be able to drill down two meters under the rover. That’s much farther down than we’ve looked before, and it will allow us to study territory that is sheltered from the planet’s punishing radiation environment. So that’s also a very exciting mission to keep an eye on.",
