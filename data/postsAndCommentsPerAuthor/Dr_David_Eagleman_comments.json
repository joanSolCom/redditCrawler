Imagine that you had a friend born blind, and she were to say to you &amp;quot;how in the world can you concentrate when you are capturing and analyzing billions of photons all the time? Don&amp;#39;t you find that overwhelming?&amp;quot;  Or imagine you have a deaf friend who says &amp;quot;how could you possibly concentrate when you&amp;#39;re getting bombarded with air compression waves that carry information about all of the world around you?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe fact is, new senses get incorporated into our daily lives such that they are somewhere between interesting and boring, but we don&amp;#39;t really need to attend to them very much at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The open question about them has simply been whether they lead to any 'transfer' of the skills learned. That is, if you learn how to solve a particular kind of puzzle in the app, does that actually help you cognitively in other skills of daily living?  The jury is still out on this question, but that is where the debate lies. In any case, I suspect that for people who are retired, it is worth doing apps like this (along with anything/everything else to stay cognitively active).",

There&amp;#39;s no question that apps like Lumosity do this. The open question about them has simply been whether they lead to any &amp;#39;transfer&amp;#39; of the skills learned. That is, if you learn how to solve a particular kind of puzzle in the app, does that actually help you cognitively in other skills of daily living?  The jury is still out on this question, but that is where the debate lies. In any case, I suspect that for people who are retired, it is worth doing apps like this (along with anything/everything else to stay cognitively active).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Note that auditory signals (speech) are easier to encode than vision: sound is just a single dimension, while visual signals are two dimensional.  Our preliminary data show that participants can reach almost 70% word recognition (in a test where chance is 25%)... and that was after a week and a half of a very easy training paradigm. We're now designing much more sophisticated (but not difficult) training paradigms -- for example, combining the buzzing of the Vest with lip reading -- which we expect will make learning even faster.\n\n3) Algorithm?  One of our algorithms is *essentially* what you describe, where each motor represents a basis function that we've derived from a corpus of spoken text.  Incoming speech is divided into 20 ms packets and the coefficients for each basis function are computed on the fly. \n\n4) Is lip reading better?  Presumably not, because of limitations with telephones, people standing behind you, etc.  Additionally, note that we're developing this system with the long-term goal of being a general-purpose data-input device (i.e. not just sound, but any data stream).  \n\nThanks for your questions!",

This requires a detailed answer that might be better answered offline... but essentially, we&amp;#39;re currently comparing 3 different algorithms for converting sound into patterns of vibration. Approaches from discrete cosine transform to determining basis sets from deep learning algorithms.  (Let me know if you want more detail on this point and I can add more).\n3) Would there be faster learning with a new input stream? Great question. We have no data on that yet, as we&amp;#39;re only using sound.  But stay posted over the next few months!      &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
