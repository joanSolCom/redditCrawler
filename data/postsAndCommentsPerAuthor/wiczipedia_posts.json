The question no one seems to be able to answer is: what can the West do about it?\n\nMy book, How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict is out now and seeks to answer that question. The lessons it contains are even more relevant in an election year,  amid the coronavirus infodemic and accusations of \"false flag\" operations in the George Floyd protests. \n\nThe book reports from the front lines of the information war in Central and Eastern Europe on five governments' responses to disinformation campaigns. It journeys into the campaigns the Russian and domestic operatives run, and shows how we can better understand the motivations behind these attacks and how to beat them. Above all, this book shows what is at stake: the future of civil discourse and democracy, and the value of truth itself. \n\nI look forward to answering your questions about the book, my work, and disinformation more broadly ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
