The past few months have been tough for everyone but there are always brighter moments amongst even the darkest ones.Fortunately, hopefully, this is one of those brighter days. After over 3 years of development, we’ve finally reached the finish line. Reaching this milestone wouldn’t be possible without you all. Maybe we are repeating ourselves but that's a simple truth. You pushed us forward and carried us here. You encouraged and gave insights during this marathon of a development.\n\nHere we are then, Ladies and Gents!\n\nSUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE has been released!\n\n[SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Launch Trailer](https://reddit.com/link/hscetv/video/xddo5dxfn8b51/player)\n\n**What comes with this update**SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE began as a tiny project, meant as free DLC for owners of SUPERHOT – a love letter to the fans who both supported us and craved even more SUPERHOT gameplay. During the development of MCD we added, we tweaked, we explored and redesigned many things from scratch. We never compromised on quality so our tiny little DLC grew into the full, standalone game that is SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE.\n\nThe game has changed.\n\nA lot of time has passed between the last MIND CONTROL DELETE update and the final release version. We have tweaked, improved and removed tons from the game. There is no point to go into detail (there’s just too much to talk about) but if you need to know MORE there is a lengthy changelog at the end of this post.\n\nAmongst general tweaks and improvements you might have noticed that you now have an option to pause the game. This might not sound like much but just wait and reach final stages of the game. You will be more than happy to have this option ;)\n\nWithout getting into spoilers, we’ve also changed some of the more hmmm “hidden” parts of gameplay. We have slightly tweaked the access to them so that even the hardiest of MCD veteran players will have a fresh challenge.\n\nA lot of love has been shown to replays. They run smoother than ever. You can share them without a hassle on all the socials. There is even a special secret photo mode but it’s a secret so let’s not spoil the fun.\n\nAlong the way, we've also added achievements to fulfil your progress hunting needs.\n\nVisually speaking the game went through an overhaul. Our Art Director went to town and relit the levels, improved shaders and rebaked every single lightmap. The game looks and performs better than ever.\n\nCheck out the changelog at the end of this post for further details.**SUPERHOT/MCD Bundle Sale**If for some unfortunate reason you missed the boat and didn’t get MCD for free, we've prepared deep discounted bundles for y'all.

Time has finally come to release it into the world.\n\nToday we are happy to announce that we are finally, once and for all, leaving Early Access!\n\nOur official launch day is July 16th, just one week away!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/ho5s5a/video/4t07u9ttmu951/player\n\nWe first need to thank all of you for supporting us throughout the entire MCD journey. Without your constant feedback, suggestions and encouragement this long road would have been way bumpier. We sure tripped a few times and took some wrong turns along the way, but you all patiently stuck with us. It has been a crazy adventure to evolve MCD together.\n\n**THANK YOU! YOU ARE AWESOME. REALLY.**\n\nAs a thank you from us,. for those that haven’t done so already, you can still immortalize yourself as a brave Early Access supporter in MCD’s credits by entering your name [here](https://superhotgame.com/more-thanks-always-more/):\n\n**We are giving away 2 million copies of MCD.

That just wouldn’t be fair.\n\nConsult the [FAQ](https://superhotgame.com/mcd-faq/) for more details.\n\n**MCD OST featuring Zardonic**\n\nTo make the wait a bit sweeter we’ve decided to gift you with the cyber-hellish sounds of MCD OST by the crazy talented Zardonic. Why Zardonic?\n\nThis dude brought the cream to the cake that is MCD. We stumbled upon his music. Fell in love with it. Contacted Zardonic. Fell in love with Zardonic.\n\nHe is a talented, hard-working artist who clicked with us so hard that it made working with him an ecstatic pleasure. He gets SUPERHOT and understands perfectly where we were going with MCD.\n\nSo, have you ever wondered what is the sound of concrete yelling into the white void?

Preparing a game to work in this environment well requires re-making it from scratch. It’s not only a different platform, it's a whole different world with its own design and hardware challenges.\n\n\\*\\*But maybe it could be easy to make it VR if...?\\*\\*No. Not yet at the very least. No such plans yet.For further info head over to our MCD FAQ.[https://superhotgame.com/mcd-faq/](https://superhotgame.com/mcd-faq/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee you very soon.July 16th, save the date.SUPERHOT Team",

That just wouldn’t be fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consult the &lt;a href=\"https://superhotgame.com/mcd-faq/\"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCD OST featuring Zardonic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make the wait a bit sweeter we’ve decided to gift you with the cyber-hellish sounds of MCD OST by the crazy talented Zardonic. Why Zardonic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This dude brought the cream to the cake that is MCD. We stumbled upon his music. Fell in love with it. Contacted Zardonic. Fell in love with Zardonic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is a talented, hard-working artist who clicked with us so hard that it made working with him an ecstatic pleasure. He gets SUPERHOT and understands perfectly where we were going with MCD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, have you ever wondered what is the sound of concrete yelling into the white void? &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmC_na-XRiW1lhQNRJbAR-w\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; is your answer. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can get SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE for free?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only those who purchased SUPERHOT before the launch of SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE are eligible for a free copy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**What is the final date to buy SUPERHOT and receive MCD for free?&lt;strong&gt;SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE will be free to anyone who purchased the original SUPERHOT before July 16th 2020&lt;/strong&gt;Will SUPERHOT Kickstarter backers get a free copy of MCD as well?**Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Is MCD coming to VR?**We don’t have any plans at the moment to redesign MCD for VR. Preparing a game to work in this environment well requires re-making it from scratch. It’s not only a different platform, it&amp;#39;s a whole different world with its own design and hardware challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**But maybe it could be easy to make it VR if...?**No. Not yet at the very least. No such plans yet.For further info head over to our MCD FAQ.&lt;a href=\"https://superhotgame.com/mcd-faq/\"&gt;https://superhotgame.com/mcd-faq/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See you very soon.July 16th, save the date.SUPERHOT Team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        "selftext": "Hey there!A couple of weeks have passed since we released SUPERHOT VR for Quest. Reception so far has been awesome and we are humbled, thank you!Dust has settled, bugs crawled to the surface, community feedback came knocking and here we are with the first patch for SUPERHOT VR on Quest.We added a few community-requested features such as the ability to use save slots and dim the brightness. We fixed quite a few issues and added a whole lotta love to general gameplay.Let’s get into a bit more detail, shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Say hello to piOS**\n\npiOS is the safe place where you go for your VR settings needs. Within piOS, you’ll be able to adjust SUPERHOT VR’s gameplay.In order to enter piOS Setup Utility, hold A and X whilst the game boots up (you’ll see an on-screen prompt).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbwam09hfw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8900f4bb0b0651a3b4d01460e9eac90be862272c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen this sexy beast will appear.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsfukccdfw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d95044f82fc89ca5a0224ba5334bfa5996c241b\n\n**pIOS Setup Utility features:**\n\n* Multiple save slots added\n* Easier way to access Guest Mode (no longer have to dig the floppy out of the trashcan)\n* Ability to revert to original pyramid flow\n* Ability to lower brightness of white space within the game – reduces peripheral vision flickering\n* Ability to lower overall brightness (includes objects within the game)\n* Ability to turn off/on the new auto-rotation system\n* Ability to turn off/on the new auto-flow system\n* Ability to skip certain scenes.\n\n**Ch-ch-ch-changes**From now on the guest mode will be available without completing the game first.With piOS Setup Utility you can enter it through settings in piOs or if you prefer to be a bit more oldschool, you can just grab the floppy in the hacker room.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbfpblg2kw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73e14beaaa558eced9d224e41bdaa5ca4c052dbd\n\nOh, and regarding floppies – now you can drop some of them too. They no longer get “glued” to your hand. Don’t drop it too far, you’ll have to crawl under the desk to retrieve it.\n\nWe also removed the secret floppy from trashbin. You can revert to the old pyramid gameflow in piOS instead of going through the trash in search of floppies.Speaking of gameflows – every time you load the game, you load into the hacker room rather than mid-level (except for the early tutorial levels). This makes it smoother to come back after being away for a while, or handing the game to a friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xjavhhukw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33b3eafb47c5443b3a341923df56338f1ad312c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Killed plenty of bugs**\n\n* Fixed challenges\n* Collision issues fixed (Chinatown and other levels)\n* Endless mode improvements (score displays properly, added a proper way to exit the Endless mode)\n* Multiple graphics fixes and improvements\n* Text rendering improvements and fixes\n* Enemy pathing improved\n* Headset in the hacker room now doesn’t escape through the wall\n* Improved pyramid locations throughout game\n* Speedrunning time displays correctly\n* Force-grab for guest floppy reduced to avoid it magically appearing in your hand\n* Hacker room hands now display the correct model\n* Oculus spatializer added\n* Many text improvements for non-English languages\n\nThat’s it!Drink lots of water.Cheers!SUPERHOT Team",

Reception so far has been awesome and we are humbled, thank you!Dust has settled, bugs crawled to the surface, community feedback came knocking and here we are with the first patch for SUPERHOT VR on Quest.We added a few community-requested features such as the ability to use save slots and dim the brightness. We fixed quite a few issues and added a whole lotta love to general gameplay.Let’s get into a bit more detail, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say hello to piOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;piOS is the safe place where you go for your VR settings needs. Within piOS, you’ll be able to adjust SUPERHOT VR’s gameplay.In order to enter piOS Setup Utility, hold A and X whilst the game boots up (you’ll see an on-screen prompt).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bbwam09hfw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8900f4bb0b0651a3b4d01460e9eac90be862272c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bbwam09hfw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8900f4bb0b0651a3b4d01460e9eac90be862272c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then this sexy beast will appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lsfukccdfw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4d95044f82fc89ca5a0224ba5334bfa5996c241b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/lsfukccdfw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4d95044f82fc89ca5a0224ba5334bfa5996c241b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pIOS Setup Utility features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Multiple save slots added&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Easier way to access Guest Mode (no longer have to dig the floppy out of the trashcan)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to revert to original pyramid flow&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to lower brightness of white space within the game – reduces peripheral vision flickering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to lower overall brightness (includes objects within the game)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to turn off/on the new auto-rotation system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to turn off/on the new auto-flow system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to skip certain scenes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ch-ch-ch-changes&lt;/strong&gt;From now on the guest mode will be available without completing the game first.With piOS Setup Utility you can enter it through settings in piOs or if you prefer to be a bit more oldschool, you can just grab the floppy in the hacker room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kbfpblg2kw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73e14beaaa558eced9d224e41bdaa5ca4c052dbd\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kbfpblg2kw631.jpg?width=1912&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73e14beaaa558eced9d224e41bdaa5ca4c052dbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and regarding floppies – now you can drop some of them too. They no longer get “glued” to your hand. Don’t drop it too far, you’ll have to crawl under the desk to retrieve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also removed the secret floppy from trashbin. You can revert to the old pyramid gameflow in piOS instead of going through the trash in search of floppies.Speaking of gameflows – every time you load the game, you load into the hacker room rather than mid-level (except for the early tutorial levels).

We are super keen to make this happen, however. Work is already underway to determine how to bring the best arcade features back home.\n\nFor more info head over to [https://superhotgame.com/arcades](https://superhotgame.com/arcades) or contact us through [vrarcade@superhotgame.com](mailto:vrarcade@superhotgame.com) or just hit me up here.",

We are super keen to make this happen, however. Work is already underway to determine how to bring the best arcade features back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more info head over to &lt;a href=\"https://superhotgame.com/arcades\"&gt;https://superhotgame.com/arcades&lt;/a&gt; or contact us through [&lt;a href=\"mailto:vrarcade@superhotgame.com\"&gt;vrarcade@superhotgame.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:vrarcade@superhotgame.com\"&gt;vrarcade@superhotgame.com&lt;/a&gt;) or just hit me up here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The visual language of SUPERHOT games and how we use it. \n\n\nAnyone who did any quality and usability tests with their game will tell you that watching someone else play your projects for the first time can be really painful experience.

Player should understand your game from the get go without you saying a word.\n\n\nBy limiting SUPERHOT to three colors we gave ourselves a clear and easy to read visual language.

Clear enough?\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/8GIXqib\n\n\nWhile this set up is easy to understand for the player it poses a bit of design difficulties and limitations.

We decided to add more umpf to the way game tells you when the hotswitch is possible. It needed to be obvious and clear for the player so he could hotswitch without any overthinking.  Marcin our art director added this sweet shader that makes red guy glitch whenever you hover your crosshair over them and hotswitch is ready.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/26JWh0z\n\nThis small addition does two things:\nLet’s you know when you can hotswitch but also lends itself visually to the glitchy aspect of MCD. \n\n\nEven the way we approach level design in SUPERHOT: MIN CONTROL DELETE follows certain rules imposed by our visual language. I’ll let Marcin The Art Dir do the talking.

That’s  creating and following a clear vocabulary of visual language. Everything so that the players might enjoy time bending gameplay of SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE without hassle.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can’t immediately see most of our visual design choices in MCD and honestly, you shouldn’t be able to.

        "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nToday's update will add content that we plan to build upon in the future. Yeah, it will “lay the foundations” for future iterations. Hence the cheezy name, forgive me for that ;). We updated various corners of SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE, traveled far into the system all for the bettering of your experience.\nSo let’s take a peek at what did we prepare for ya’ll this time:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**UI**\n\n***Pyramid pop up menu***. \n\n\nWe came up with an entirely new menu system.\nIt will lay groundwork for making the progression clearer and more meaningful. Your run through the game will be far more unique due to your own choices. You might go straight through the runs or you might try unlocking a certain parts of the pyramid. You might just be hardcore and try to unlock every single stage in the pyramid. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/0JXPO3R\n\nMore details about new pyramid menu over[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhot/comments/88kzvu/mcd_friday_devlog_10_the_pyramid/?st=jfwykdzs&amp;sh=229d90c0)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Levels**\n\n***Glitch Barriers*** \n\nIt’s a system that makes geometry suddenly pop out in the middle of a level. \nThe further you go into the game the more glitched barriers will appear. Levels that you thought you knew will change along with your progression in MCD. This is also an intro to our concept of “glitch in the system”. We are still doing some heavy iterating on this so both how they look and how we use them might change. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/boVmHwy\n\nA bit more on the Glitchy Goodness [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhot/comments/8ahrls/mcd_friday_devlog11_glitch/?st=jfwyk96z&amp;sh=5e9b6214).\n\n\n*Mushrooms*\n\nWe decreased number of mushrooms on higher difficulties. Personally, me love me some shrooms but we noticed people complain about them spawning like crazy so we listened and complied. Here to serve.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**MINDS**\n\nWe did some minor gameplay optimalisation for all minds:\nAll MINDs move 10% faster.\nMINDs bounce off enemies when jumping on them.\n\n***Ninja***\n\nI am a shameless Ninja main so all the tweaks for this mind always make me happy. There has been some minor movement of skills in mods menu for general gameplay sake. But important change comes with the addition (or tweak actually) of TrickThrow, previously BouncyShuriken. It will make easier catching thrown projectiles and on top of that it will unlock piercing enemies on all knife throwables . After current update you will be able to pull off some spectacular and ridiculous combos.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ob2oDlo\n\n**Exact Ninja changes :**\n\n* Moved Faster Movement MOD to different category.\n* HiddenShuriken moved to tier 1 (from tier 3)\n* Recall shuriken moved to tier 2.\n* Changed BouncyShuriken to TrickThrow.\n* Moved TrickThrow to tier 3.\n* TrickThrow makes all shuriken-like throwables bounce back toward the player after hitting an enemy.\n* TrickThrow makes all knife-like throwables pierce through enemies.\n* Added DeathStomp MOD as tier 2 MOD.\n* Cutting bullets is easier even without deflect bullets MOD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***Enemies***\n\nAgain, you made some valid and reasonable comments regarding enemies so we tried to deliver. Someone made a good point about concrete guys not feeling as “concrete”. We try to make them feel different by changing how certain actions work on them. One of those experiments led to changes in throwables. From now on they will stick to them instead of killing.\nAnother change comes to Red Dudes (or Agents as some of you pointed out) with katanas. Up to this point they weren’t really creating much danger. As Czarek once called them, they were “Katana delivery” rather than an actual threat. \nSo we gave those poor guys an option to cut off your hands if you try to attack them unarmed.\nThey even wave you goodbye :)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/QIOsARt\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nP.S.\nA lot of you pointed out at the lack of story updates (who knew, people actually care about story, damn). We had to steal all the guys responsible for Story Updates to fill up the ranks for Mechanical Updates.At the moment we are looking for new peeps to help out with shaping the content of MCD plot.\n**tl;dr** Story updates are suspended until we refill our story driven ranks.\n\nThat's it. Go test this update out and let us know what you think.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHug people. All of them.\n\nSzymon from SUPERHOT Team",

Yeah, it will “lay the foundations” for future iterations. Hence the cheezy name, forgive me for that ;). We updated various corners of SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE, traveled far into the system all for the bettering of your experience.\nSo let’s take a peek at what did we prepare for ya’ll this time:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pyramid pop up menu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We came up with an entirely new menu system.\nIt will lay groundwork for making the progression clearer and more meaningful. Your run through the game will be far more unique due to your own choices. You might go straight through the runs or you might try unlocking a certain parts of the pyramid. You might just be hardcore and try to unlock every single stage in the pyramid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/0JXPO3R\"&gt;https://imgur.com/0JXPO3R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More details about new pyramid menu over&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/superhot/comments/88kzvu/mcd_friday_devlog_10_the_pyramid/?st=jfwykdzs&amp;amp;sh=229d90c0\"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glitch Barriers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a system that makes geometry suddenly pop out in the middle of a level. \nThe further you go into the game the more glitched barriers will appear. Levels that you thought you knew will change along with your progression in MCD. This is also an intro to our concept of “glitch in the system”. We are still doing some heavy iterating on this so both how they look and how we use them might change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/boVmHwy\"&gt;https://imgur.com/boVmHwy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit more on the Glitchy Goodness &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/superhot/comments/8ahrls/mcd_friday_devlog11_glitch/?st=jfwyk96z&amp;amp;sh=5e9b6214\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mushrooms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decreased number of mushrooms on higher difficulties. Personally, me love me some shrooms but we noticed people complain about them spawning like crazy so we listened and complied. Here to serve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did some minor gameplay optimalisation for all minds:\nAll MINDs move 10% faster.\nMINDs bounce off enemies when jumping on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninja&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a shameless Ninja main so all the tweaks for this mind always make me happy. There has been some minor movement of skills in mods menu for general gameplay sake. But important change comes with the addition (or tweak actually) of TrickThrow, previously BouncyShuriken. It will make easier catching thrown projectiles and on top of that it will unlock piercing enemies on all knife throwables . After current update you will be able to pull off some spectacular and ridiculous combos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/ob2oDlo\"&gt;https://imgur.com/ob2oDlo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exact Ninja changes :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moved Faster Movement MOD to different category.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HiddenShuriken moved to tier 1 (from tier 3)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recall shuriken moved to tier 2.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changed BouncyShuriken to TrickThrow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moved TrickThrow to tier 3.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TrickThrow makes all shuriken-like throwables bounce back toward the player after hitting an enemy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TrickThrow makes all knife-like throwables pierce through enemies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added DeathStomp MOD as tier 2 MOD.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cutting bullets is easier even without deflect bullets MOD.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enemies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, you made some valid and reasonable comments regarding enemies so we tried to deliver. Someone made a good point about concrete guys not feeling as “concrete”. We try to make them feel different by changing how certain actions work on them. One of those experiments led to changes in throwables. From now on they will stick to them instead of killing.\nAnother change comes to Red Dudes (or Agents as some of you pointed out) with katanas. Up to this point they weren’t really creating much danger. As Czarek once called them, they were “Katana delivery” rather than an actual threat. \nSo we gave those poor guys an option to cut off your hands if you try to attack them unarmed.\nThey even wave you goodbye :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/QIOsARt\"&gt;https://imgur.com/QIOsARt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.\nA lot of you pointed out at the lack of story updates (who knew, people actually care about story, damn). We had to steal all the guys responsible for Story Updates to fill up the ranks for Mechanical Updates.At the moment we are looking for new peeps to help out with shaping the content of MCD plot.\n&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Story updates are suspended until we refill our story driven ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. Go test this update out and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hug people. All of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Szymon from SUPERHOT Team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

You see, up to this point we have been using GUI based on SUPERHOT and it’s all fine and dandy but those are two slightly different games.

Hence the introduction of Pyramid GUI for runs!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/30e1y\n\nEach sector of the pyramid will have to be unlocked with HotCoins. You will not only unlock next runs but Minds and additional bonuses as well. \nWill it change much? Well yes and no. It will give us a shit ton of possibilities to diversify how you play MCD. Completion of runs will obviously stay the same. You will just have more choices to make along the way. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Hca7l\n\nSome parts of the pyramid might be impossible to unlock straight away unless you grind out enough HotCoins others might need a a bit of exploration of the internet.exe side of MCD.\n    \nThis will  make players progression through the game unique to their own choices. You might go straight through the runs or you might try unlocking a certain parts of the pyramid. You might just be hardcore and try to unlock every single stage in the pyramid. Your choice :)\n\nWhy pyramid though? \nFirst and foremost it lends itself well design-wise and theme-wise . Additionally it fits nicely within SUPERHOT universe lore.

SXSW was especially interesting since we had a possibility to meet and mingle with players at our booth. \n\nI thought that to compensate for the last week’s lack of update I will make this less bloated with text and a bit more visual. During a week of my absence from SUPERHOT studio, guys made some really fun content. Not everything will be available straight away in the upcoming SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE update but I had to at least give you peek :) .\nAs the title suggest I obliged myself to give you a glimpse into upcoming levels/content.\n\nWhat I haven’t done for quite some time is to give you guys a bit of a tease before we have an actual release of content. Please keep in mind that, since it is early access, design might change ten times on a daily basis. \n\nSo without further ado:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JVEIK\n\nCan you tell anything from them? What is the main theme of each level? What are those locations?\nLet us know what you think about them. \n\nOh and first three people to guess the themes of levels will get a swag bag from us ;) .\n\nNo, seriously just guess the themes of upcoming levels and I will send you a reward.\n\nBack to work\n\nSzymon from SUPERHOT Team",

SXSW was especially interesting since we had a possibility to meet and mingle with players at our booth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought that to compensate for the last week’s lack of update I will make this less bloated with text and a bit more visual. During a week of my absence from SUPERHOT studio, guys made some really fun content. Not everything will be available straight away in the upcoming SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE update but I had to at least give you peek :) .\nAs the title suggest I obliged myself to give you a glimpse into upcoming levels/content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I haven’t done for quite some time is to give you guys a bit of a tease before we have an actual release of content. Please keep in mind that, since it is early access, design might change ten times on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JVEIK\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/JVEIK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you tell anything from them? What is the main theme of each level? What are those locations?\nLet us know what you think about them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and first three people to guess the themes of levels will get a swag bag from us ;) .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, seriously just guess the themes of upcoming levels and I will send you a reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Szymon from SUPERHOT Team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Another update! \nThis one really adds a lot of “umpf” to the general gameplay. \nWe made some changes to MINDS so that they differentiate from each other even more.\nI feel that we are getting closer to that overall vision that we had in the beginning. We are slowly giving the players features and gameplay mechanics that we wanted. It’s still a long way ahead but this update should hopefully give you glimpse into the future of SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE ;)\n\nLet’s get right to it shall we?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEXPAND MENU\n\nDue to clarity reasons we did some tweaking of the overall look. As you might noticed EXPAND menu gained several different MODs for each of our MINDS. Therefore you can create custom builds for your runs. They really change the feel of the game and give a ton of new satisfying solutions.\nAnother obvious thing that you will notice is the fact that we replaced score with HC (Hot Coins).\nYou will acquire them by completing levels and decrypting new runs. In the future we plan to add several new ways of amassing HotCoin wealth but for the time being we need to tackle how the general economy works.\nHC will be used to unlock new MODs for your MINDS. Once unlocked it will give you an option to chose another, more advanced MOD.\nWe removed Full Heal MOD but from now players will autoheal 1 heart once they reach the store.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNINJA\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PgAUN\n\nOh me likey Ninja. After this update I enjoy it even more.\nNinja starts the game with 2 hearts and can't increase their number.\nAlso from the beginning of the game Ninja will use Soft Punches and Lousy shooter MODs. Which basically means that it will take one more punch for Ninja to finish a guy and his reload time is a bit longer as well. \nAll that is not important really. What is important is the new Deflect Bullets MOD. No one button nonsense. It’s skill based. It’s timing based. It’s sexy. It’s satisfying as hell and you will die a lot while trying it. Fun! \n\nAll the Ninja MODS are as follows:\nFaster Movement (Uhm you move faster)\nDeflect bullets (Slice bullets to send them back at the enemy.)\nPiercing katana (Thrown Katana goes through multiple enemies)\nMaster Swordsman (Increased range and speed of katana slashes)\nRecall shuriken (Recall your piercing throwables just like a katana)\nBouncy shuriken (Piercing throwables bounce off enemies)\nHidden shuriken (Pressing “throw” when unarmed spawns a shuriken)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nADDICT\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wkqyC\n\nAddict now starts with Soft Hotswitch instead of Hotswitch MOD. That means that enemies will only get stunned after your Hotswitch.\nAddict starts with 3 hearts and can't increase their number.\nEven though I still have a soft spot for Ninja those MODs really made me smile.\nAddict will have three levels of hotswitch now. THREE! Dude, just reach Ultra Hotswitch! No question asked.\n\n\nMODS for Addict:\nStart with pistol (Start every level with a pistol)\nStart with shotgun (Start every level with a shotgun)\nStart with rifle (Start every level with a rifle)\nStrong punches (Break the enemy with one less strike)\nStrong Throws ( It take less throwables to break enemies)\nSlomo jump (Jump in slow motion by holding space)\nHotswitch ( Disposed body breaks after Hotswitch)\nPerfect Hotswitch (Switched body doesn’t lose his weapon)\nUltra Hotswitch (You can hotswitch multiple times in a row)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMUSHROOMS\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Ag1nR\n\nOh and boy oh boy we have Mushrooms as well! You know that type of red mushrooms that grow on the wall and explode with a glorious cloud of bullets whenever you get to close or shoot them? They also make this creepy sound to let you know about their location? Spawn on levels on higher difficulties?\nNo? Ok so read up about them over [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhot/comments/7zs9ko/mcd_dev_log_7_shrooms/?st=jejutrlp&amp;sh=10cfc9f0) .\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\nMinor fixes for existing bugs. \nPotentially a ton of new bugs ;)\nKeep cool and call your mum sometimes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSzymon From SUPERHOT Team",

No one knew whether Panos sleeps in the studio or starts work really early. You could only hear his roaring voice coming from his room. Well, at least we knew he is alive.\nOn a third day he came back. A bit thinner, hair resembling a forest after a storm, with a smirk cutting across his pale face.\n“Thi-this!

Very first update for MIND CONTROL DELETE!\nLet’s get right to it and see what’s in store.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n\n* Four new levels (Desperados Bar, Lab, Office, Oil Rig)\nIf you’ve played SUPERHOT before you might recognise some of them.\nThey have been “refreshed” for MCD. We tweaked some covers, sprinkled it with new throwables and fixed spawning points. \nAlso, on a side note, Oil rig is a level that some of you might recognise from SUPERHOT VR.\nThis fella went through a lot of redesigning. From endless level through VR to finally finishing in MCD where it should be. There is a different \"feel\" about him but you have to check it out yourself.\n\n\n* Keybinds\nFinally you will be able to change controls to suit your fancy playstyle habits.\nAll those AZERTY keyboards are screaming. \n\n* Smaller collider on player’s head\nThis one was actually pretty annoying for a lot of people. You will be able to dodge bullets in a more efficient manner now. No unexpected headshots for you.\n \nRemaining changes for gameplay:\n\n* Changed slomotion jumping tip\n* HUD tweaks (changed recall katana skill icon)\n* Added more customization options in graphics settings\n\n**Bug Fixes:**\n\n*“To err is human, to persist in error is diabolical.”*\nHere is the rundown of bugs and errors we smushed.\n\n\n* Player can no longer grab items through walls\n* Level tweaks (bug fixes, new throwables)\n* Fixed bug with changing the volume in settings\n* Fixes to katana recall skill (katana bowling remains unchanged for now)\n* Enemies can no longer kill you after the end of the level\n* Audio fixes (defrag, esc sound, volumes)\n* Other fixes to stuff you don't really care about but we do cause we love you.\n\n\nThat's it for this update but no worries we are not done for this month.\n Next up is  **Story Update** coming in late January.\n\nUntil that time:\nstay healthy, stay safe and first and foremost stay tuned.\n\nLove y'all\nSzymon from SUPERHOT Team",

Very first update for MIND CONTROL DELETE!\nLet’s get right to it and see what’s in store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four new levels (Desperados Bar, Lab, Office, Oil Rig)\nIf you’ve played SUPERHOT before you might recognise some of them.\nThey have been “refreshed” for MCD. We tweaked some covers, sprinkled it with new throwables and fixed spawning points. \nAlso, on a side note, Oil rig is a level that some of you might recognise from SUPERHOT VR.\nThis fella went through a lot of redesigning. From endless level through VR to finally finishing in MCD where it should be. There is a different &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; about him but you have to check it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keybinds\nFinally you will be able to change controls to suit your fancy playstyle habits.\nAll those AZERTY keyboards are screaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller collider on player’s head\nThis one was actually pretty annoying for a lot of people. You will be able to dodge bullets in a more efficient manner now. No unexpected headshots for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remaining changes for gameplay:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changed slomotion jumping tip&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HUD tweaks (changed recall katana skill icon)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added more customization options in graphics settings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To err is human, to persist in error is diabolical.”&lt;/em&gt;\nHere is the rundown of bugs and errors we smushed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Player can no longer grab items through walls&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level tweaks (bug fixes, new throwables)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fixed bug with changing the volume in settings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fixes to katana recall skill (katana bowling remains unchanged for now)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enemies can no longer kill you after the end of the level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Audio fixes (defrag, esc sound, volumes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other fixes to stuff you don&amp;#39;t really care about but we do cause we love you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for this update but no worries we are not done for this month.\n Next up is  &lt;strong&gt;Story Update&lt;/strong&gt; coming in late January.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until that time:\nstay healthy, stay safe and first and foremost stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love y&amp;#39;all\nSzymon from SUPERHOT Team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Just like the good old Kickstarter days. \nWith MCD in early access we are coming back to regular updates. Additionally we will stream a few times per month for more direct contact with you guys. Bring your questions,suggestions and life stories. \n\nYour feedback is already very helpful and it's just the beginning of the whole trip with MCD. \nTake a peek at our first stream and join MCD Discord to have a taste of beautiful chaos that dwells over there :)\n\nMCD Dev Stream #1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUdyeaU6G8M\n\nDiscord link\nhttps://discordapp.com/invite/NJKgwvx\n\nCaffeine link\nhttps://www.caffeine.tv/superhotthegame/profile\n\n\nBack to work.

We don’t want to bragg. Should we? I don’t know!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Where is Kuba??”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean playing Mtg?Now?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/sOxjU\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/sOxjU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JTQ9n\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/JTQ9n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/10vKg\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/10vKg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cables lying everywhere,people running around, somebody is missing, oh shit, oh shit. \nPanic and excitement, anxiety and joy.

Starting over, getting people&amp;#39;s feedback while you are still working on something and polishing along the way. Just like the good old Kickstarter days. \nWith MCD in early access we are coming back to regular updates. Additionally we will stream a few times per month for more direct contact with you guys. Bring your questions,suggestions and life stories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is already very helpful and it&amp;#39;s just the beginning of the whole trip with MCD. \nTake a peek at our first stream and join MCD Discord to have a taste of beautiful chaos that dwells over there :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MCD Dev Stream #1\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUdyeaU6G8M\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUdyeaU6G8M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discord link\n&lt;a href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/NJKgwvx\"&gt;https://discordapp.com/invite/NJKgwvx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caffeine link\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.caffeine.tv/superhotthegame/profile\"&gt;https://www.caffeine.tv/superhotthegame/profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to work.

It’s reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of super close cooperation between SUPERHOT and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR is releasing with Oculus Touch controllers and is available to purchase today!\n\n\nIf you’re one of the lucky few and you’re already kitted out with the necessary hardware, then wait no more. Drop in and enjoy the visceral, satisfyingly physical world of SUPERHOT VR. \n\n\nPURCHASE FOR OCULUS TOUCH NOW\nhttps://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1012593518800648/\n\n\nNo worries if you’re not getting Touches anytime soon or if you already embraced a different platform though! Having released SUPERHOT VR for Oculus, we’re now starting to poke around supporting all the other VR systems (wink, WINK). I’ll keep you updated on the progress!\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/aHDgEp0\n\nWe got quite swallowed by work on redesigning SUPERHOT for VR but damn it was fun! I’ve spent my first week with the game just juggling and physically throwing objects at red guys :) . \n\n\n**Realities of Virtual Reality**\n\nThe VR as a platform is still relatively fresh and full of uncharted territories. To be honest we had tons of frustrating, puzzle solving fun just testing the possibilities and iterating. It’s a super new technology so there is a lot to tackle and learn. No matter what we tried to take from the original SUPERHOT, we invariably ended up with a decision to either compromise and make it play poorly or to push through, work harder and redesign things from scratch straight into VR. Basic stuff like player movement or item interaction in VR forced us to completely change our approach to level architecture and gameplay. We’re not too good at compromising so pretty much everything in SUPERHOT VR is new, built with only VR in mind. It’s pretty exciting! You constantly learn and explore and then you learn some more. \n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gmGpMpz\n\n\nVirtual reality brings a whole new level of immersion and freedom to games. SUPERHOT has always rewarded gameplay improvisation and VR closes a couple of doors for that but opens a whole lot more. People playtesting SUPERHOT VR pulled some amazing stunts that we could never think of while designing the game. We seriously can’t wait to push the release button and to see what people will come up with during the first playthroughs.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ohdCgMg\n\nhttp://imgur.com/DKpMoPa\n\nhttp://imgur.com/wxBQCXs\n\nhttp://imgur.com/QZHYDlp\n\nhttp://imgur.com/YpbkLVc\n\n\n**TINY FAQ:**\n\n**Is it really FREE for all kickstarter backers and preorders?**\n\n\nYes Sir.\n\n\n**So this is a new, separate game?**\n\n\nRight again.\n\n**Will you release SUPERHOT VR on other VR platforms?**\n\n\nYes! You are good at this.\n\n**What are the minimum specs?**\n\n\nVideo Card \tNVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or greater\nCPU \t\tIntel i5-4590 equivalent or greater\nMemory \t8GB+ RAM\nVideo Output \tCompatible HDMI 1.3 video output\nUSB Ports \t3x USB 3.0 ports plus 1x USB 2.0 port\nOS \t\tWindows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer\n\n\n**How much is the fish?** \n\n\n24.99$\n\n\n**Release date on Oculus Store?**\n\n\n6th of December. Kinda 5thish actually. It’s probably out already by the time we post this update!\n\n\n**Will the regular version of SUPERHOT get VR support too?**\n\n\nNope. VR is just waaaay too different. We will be working to get SUPERHOT VR to other VR platforms though.\n\n\n**I’m a Kickstarter / preorder backer, I love you guys and I want you to love me back with a key?**\n\n\nWe’re shoving emails with your keys into the pipes as fast as that poor mailchimp monkey can handle. If you changed your email address since backing or if your key got lost in the interweb tubes, please let us know at wheresmykeybutistillloveyou@superhotgame.com. &lt;3\n\n\n**What about all the other nonVR stuff you’re working on?**\nIt’s still in the works! Good things take time but I’ll catch an update for you guys next time.\n\n\nThat’s it for today folks! \n\n\nCheers\n",

We seriously can’t wait to push the release button and to see what people will come up with during the first playthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/ohdCgMg\"&gt;http://imgur.com/ohdCgMg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/DKpMoPa\"&gt;http://imgur.com/DKpMoPa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/wxBQCXs\"&gt;http://imgur.com/wxBQCXs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/QZHYDlp\"&gt;http://imgur.com/QZHYDlp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/YpbkLVc\"&gt;http://imgur.com/YpbkLVc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TINY FAQ:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it really FREE for all kickstarter backers and preorders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes Sir.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this is a new, separate game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you release SUPERHOT VR on other VR platforms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes! You are good at this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the minimum specs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video Card  NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or greater\nCPU         Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater\nMemory  8GB+ RAM\nVideo Output    Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output\nUSB Ports   3x USB 3.0 ports plus 1x USB 2.0 port\nOS      Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much is the fish?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24.99$&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release date on Oculus Store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6th of December. Kinda 5thish actually. It’s probably out already by the time we post this update!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the regular version of SUPERHOT get VR support too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. VR is just waaaay too different. We will be working to get SUPERHOT VR to other VR platforms though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a Kickstarter / preorder backer, I love you guys and I want you to love me back with a key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re shoving emails with your keys into the pipes as fast as that poor mailchimp monkey can handle. If you changed your email address since backing or if your key got lost in the interweb tubes, please let us know at &lt;a href=\"mailto:wheresmykeybutistillloveyou@superhotgame.com\"&gt;wheresmykeybutistillloveyou@superhotgame.com&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about all the other nonVR stuff you’re working on?&lt;/strong&gt;\nIt’s still in the works! Good things take time but I’ll catch an update for you guys next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today folks! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It took that much time due to simple location of SUPERHOT studio.\nEven at this age of \"global village\" our communication with Microsoft was slowed down by time difference.\nSo basic conversation would take a couple of hours (and Microsoft guys are VERY responsive).\nNontheless, here we are. SUPERHOT is ready for XBOX ONE (although there is minor setup of dates and shops ahead). Now we wil be able to jump in full force on the DLC and VR!\n\nSpeaking of DLC, there is already some content ready. I will try to take some screenshots while no one is looking :) For now I can only say that our level designers did some cool stuff based on some movies.\nBut shhhh.\n\nNext week we are hitting the road in Europe.

We want our game to work smoothly so this can only help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I realized I haven&amp;#39;t showed any screenshots recently so here is a quick look in up to date graphics of SUPERHOT :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/w9SKWZE\"&gt;https://imgur.com/w9SKWZE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/hH1DlyQ\"&gt;https://imgur.com/hH1DlyQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/fAov4eY\"&gt;https://imgur.com/fAov4eY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/fiyaVma\"&gt;https://imgur.com/fiyaVma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

You helped us build SUPERHOT to its current state. \nThank you all for your support and help along the way.\n\nYou played prototypes, alphas, betas and always send valuable feedback. Some of you even started developing mods.\nWell after 2.5 years of developement we can finally announce the release date.\n\nSUPERHOT will be coming out on 25 fabruary of 2016.\n\nHere is the official release date teaser:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWJSiJsmO-A\n\nAlso we decided to create this FAQ to help answer some of recurring questions:\n\n\n\nWhere can I buy SUPERHOT?\n\nYou will be able to buy SUPERHOT on Steam and with a tremendous number of smaller digital and physical retailers around the globe. \n\nSo you’re doing boxes too?\n\nYup. Our super awesome friends from IMGN.pro are coordinating manufacturing and physical distribution pretty much world-wide. \n\nWhat do you mean global release?\n\nSUPERHOT will be out on 25th of February in a whole bunch of languages. Chances are it’ll be available in your own native language and in a brick’n’mortar store near you!\n\nWhat platforms are you releasing?\n\nIt will be released on PC/Mac/Linux first. SUPERHOT for Xbox One will be available a few short weeks later.\n\nBut what about VR?\n\nBig plans ahead for virtual reality. We’re working on something larger than we originally thought possible. We’ll start getting talkative about it after we release the regular reality version of SUPERHOT.\n\nWhat are the minimal system requirements?\n\nNothing too fancy. We had SUPERHOT tested and fully playable with good framerates on: \n\nIntel Core2Quad Q6600 2,40 GHz\n4 GB Ram\nGeForce GTX 650 (1024 MB Ram)\nHDD 500 GB\n\nWe’re still tweaking and optimizing so stay tuned about the specifics in the following weeks.\n\nAre you doing preorders?\n\nNope. We’re actually removing the currently available preorder-priced support options from our website in a few days. Buy the game, play the game. Slick and simple.\n\nIs SUPERHOT going to be awesome?\n\nYes. Very much so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So we decided to help him, and mix his skills and passion ;)\n\nCurrent work revolves around checking which levels can be used for the VR and which ones need rebuilding. Most probably we will have to build new levels , just for VR.\nFurthermore Pawel works on adjusting SUPERHOT's controls,GUI and all round user experience.\n\nThere is still lots of work to be done in Virtual Reality version. Because of vastly different platform requirements SUPERHOT VR will be almost a different game. But even at this stage simple act of shooting in SUPERHOT VR is very,very satisfying :) .\n\nNext week we will have some great news so stay tuned guys!\n\nBack to work.\nCheers",

        "selftext": "Hello backers.\n\nRecently we acquired a little outside help in person of Scott Alexander. Scott is a great writer that worked for various game studios( some of them were also polish). \nWe reached out to him because we needed to improve SUPERHOT's story. There was a need for a fresh, outside of studio perspective. Also we wanted to hone chat section of the game. Let's be honest we might be able to speak english but we will never be native speakers.\nSome of the dialogues needed adjustements so they would \"sound\" more natural.\n\nStorywise we know where we are headed but as I wrote earlier we needed a fresh perspective and a writer thats creates for games. \nStory is a tricky subject in games . It's hard to blend with the game mechanic and is very often treated as na addition rather than a crucial part.  \nHonestly games are an awkard tools to tell a story. They are great at teaching you patterns but not really at creating a plot. Its rare to have games with balanced gameplay and storytelling. We tend to either skip a boring story or skip the game itself.\n\nThat is why we decided to give the plot some extra attention. We always strive for the best when is comes to SUPERHOT.\n\n\nChanging topics before we wrap it up.\n\nSome people asked if we abandoned the VR version of SUPERHOT.\nStraight to the point, no we did not. \nWe actually hired additional stuff just for the VR. This version will be a very different game to work on and we are a small team. We have to prioritize our goals. I know I repeat myself but we really don't want to release something half finished. VR version will get all of our attention after the SUPERHOT steam release.\n\nThank you for understanding.\n\nCheers\n\n",

Scott is a great writer that worked for various game studios( some of them were also polish). \nWe reached out to him because we needed to improve SUPERHOT&amp;#39;s story. There was a need for a fresh, outside of studio perspective. Also we wanted to hone chat section of the game. Let&amp;#39;s be honest we might be able to speak english but we will never be native speakers.\nSome of the dialogues needed adjustements so they would &amp;quot;sound&amp;quot; more natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Storywise we know where we are headed but as I wrote earlier we needed a fresh perspective and a writer thats creates for games. \nStory is a tricky subject in games . It&amp;#39;s hard to blend with the game mechanic and is very often treated as na addition rather than a crucial part.&lt;br/&gt;\nHonestly games are an awkard tools to tell a story. They are great at teaching you patterns but not really at creating a plot. Its rare to have games with balanced gameplay and storytelling. We tend to either skip a boring story or skip the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is why we decided to give the plot some extra attention. We always strive for the best when is comes to SUPERHOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Changing topics before we wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people asked if we abandoned the VR version of SUPERHOT.\nStraight to the point, no we did not. \nWe actually hired additional stuff just for the VR. This version will be a very different game to work on and we are a small team. We have to prioritize our goals. I know I repeat myself but we really don&amp;#39;t want to release something half finished. VR version will get all of our attention after the SUPERHOT steam release.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Well not really . \nTo be honest we struggled to get out of studio because there is still so much work.\n\nGamewise as you already know we are almost done. Constantly we adjust ,change and add elements but its polishing work. \n QA testing is going well and soon we will work with more testers .\n\nBecause the release date is approaching there is increasingly more work outside of basic game developement. We are working hard on planning SUPERHOT's promotion camapaign and have some exciting ideas . \n\nAs usual I can only reveal some of it . One of the things we work on is our own spot in soon to be opened Games Museum in Warsaw ! \n\nComing back to game itself, we prepared little something for christmas. \nEnjoy:\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/SlimImpartialElver\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/SlipperyCanineGalapagosmockingbird\n\n\nMerry Christmas!\n",

Well not really . \nTo be honest we struggled to get out of studio because there is still so much work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gamewise as you already know we are almost done. Constantly we adjust ,change and add elements but its polishing work. \n QA testing is going well and soon we will work with more testers .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the release date is approaching there is increasingly more work outside of basic game developement. We are working hard on planning SUPERHOT&amp;#39;s promotion camapaign and have some exciting ideas . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As usual I can only reveal some of it . One of the things we work on is our own spot in soon to be opened Games Museum in Warsaw ! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming back to game itself, we prepared little something for christmas. \nEnjoy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gfycat.com/SlimImpartialElver\"&gt;https://gfycat.com/SlimImpartialElver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gfycat.com/SlipperyCanineGalapagosmockingbird\"&gt;https://gfycat.com/SlipperyCanineGalapagosmockingbird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Since the release date is slowly approaching we try not to add new elements to SUPERHOT and instead concentrate on polishing existing content. \nBut sometimes there are those nagging ideas that just stay with you when you go to sleep.  You can't think of anything else and you just need to share them.\nA lot of new concepts start like :\n„Hey man wouldn't it be cool if we could…?”\n„Oh damn!Yeah!”\nWhat I am trying to say here is that we added 2 new levels even though we really didn't want to. Sorry for that. :)\nWe had to, they were too cool to pass. Both are based on scenes from movies but thats the only thing that connetcs them. The dynamic, pace and setting is completely different.\n\nI would love to just show you how they look but our Art Dir and Game Lead are watching closely. \nSo! To sort of move around the restrictions of nonspoiling anything, here is a random selection of new levels (ok, one of them you should know from beta :) ) with top down view.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/NDuFyN5\n\nhttp://imgur.com/fOn3q0n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4hFOWxN\n\nAnd just one screenshot. It shows little bit of new level but it hopefully doesn't show a lot :)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/F2AQ72N\n\nBack to work\nCheers\n\n\n",

Since the release date is slowly approaching we try not to add new elements to SUPERHOT and instead concentrate on polishing existing content. \nBut sometimes there are those nagging ideas that just stay with you when you go to sleep.  You can&amp;#39;t think of anything else and you just need to share them.\nA lot of new concepts start like :\n„Hey man wouldn&amp;#39;t it be cool if we could…?”\n„Oh damn!Yeah!”\nWhat I am trying to say here is that we added 2 new levels even though we really didn&amp;#39;t want to. Sorry for that. :)\nWe had to, they were too cool to pass. Both are based on scenes from movies but thats the only thing that connetcs them. The dynamic, pace and setting is completely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to just show you how they look but our Art Dir and Game Lead are watching closely. \nSo! To sort of move around the restrictions of nonspoiling anything, here is a random selection of new levels (ok, one of them you should know from beta :) ) with top down view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/NDuFyN5\"&gt;http://imgur.com/NDuFyN5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/fOn3q0n\"&gt;http://imgur.com/fOn3q0n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/4hFOWxN\"&gt;http://imgur.com/4hFOWxN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just one screenshot. It shows little bit of new level but it hopefully doesn&amp;#39;t show a lot :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/F2AQ72N\"&gt;http://imgur.com/F2AQ72N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to work\nCheers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

After every level you will be able to see  how long it took you to beat it as well as current best time.\nA glimpse at new best time score feature:\n\nhttp://gfycat.com/QuaintIdioticAsiansmallclawedotter\n\nSeems like nothing right? Well yes and no.\nAfter we set up temporary best time scores for each level we got ourselves a totally new game experience.\nPreviously we played for the \"badassnes\" factor. Killing guys up close, dodging bullets,catching guns in mid air, multiple headshots, those were our goals.\nAll of a sudden, new style of gameplay emerged, there was a high score to beat, a time limit to fit in. Suddenly everyone started to play in a more tactical fashion. Now you have to calculate your every single step. \n\"How close am I to this gun?\";\n\"Should I shoot now or move closer?\";\n\"How much time will I lose if I turn around?\". And so on, and so on. This style of playing feels more like tactical puzzle with shooting rather than a shooter with some cool time mechanic.\nNow its all about ruthless efficency, tactical approach and movement economy.\nThere is no place here for being fancy, son!\nHeadshots rate in our studio dropped seriously low, everyone aims at torsos or legs. That might sound boring and dissatisfying but its seriously not!\nWe were all suprised by how much fun this little feature added to the overall gameplay. When we could actually compare our scores to each other everyone started grinding for scores :) I guess that something as primal as rivarly and comeptition just runs in peoples veins.\nWe can't wait to put this feature in your hands. You guys can do crazy stuff with SUPERHOT and for sure there will be some amazing best scores to beat.\nFor now, we will live in a beautifull world of our best time scores.

Well yes and no.\nAfter we set up temporary best time scores for each level we got ourselves a totally new game experience.\nPreviously we played for the &amp;quot;badassnes&amp;quot; factor. Killing guys up close, dodging bullets,catching guns in mid air, multiple headshots, those were our goals.\nAll of a sudden, new style of gameplay emerged, there was a high score to beat, a time limit to fit in. Suddenly everyone started to play in a more tactical fashion. Now you have to calculate your every single step. \n&amp;quot;How close am I to this gun?&amp;quot;;\n&amp;quot;Should I shoot now or move closer?&amp;quot;;\n&amp;quot;How much time will I lose if I turn around?&amp;quot;.
