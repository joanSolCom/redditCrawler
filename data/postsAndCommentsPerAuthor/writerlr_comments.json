        "body": "Thanks for asking -- hope you're well!\n\nAspects of my background are sprinkled through a handful of these answers, but in brief: I was a Capitol Hill intern for then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008, got to do some writing for him, and then parlayed that experience into speechwriting jobs on the Hill, a Senate campaign, and four years in the Obama Admin (followed by a jump to the private sector when my old boss, AG Holder, left in 2015).\n\nTo be a successful speechwriter, first and foremost, you need to write -- AND read -- a LOT. Like, every day. Thanks to shows like The West Wing, I feel like speechwriting has a certain amount of (nerdy) sex appeal -- and a lot of people think of the job the way it's portrayed on TV and in movies: sitting around having philosophical discussions with the boss, flying around on government jets, looking like Rob Lowe.\n\nIt IS an amazing job, you DO get to work closely with interesting/powerful people in pinch-me-I-must-be-dreaming settings, and the whole motorcade/government jet thing is as cool as you think it is. BUT... that's not the job, and you don't get to do any of that unless you just absolutely kick ass at turning blank pages into snappy, effective speeches. Which can be incredibly grueling. Many times during my career -- especially in the Administration and on the campaign trail -- I'd finish a draft at 1am, edit a different speech, and then start another one, all before going to bed at 3am and getting up in time to throw on a suit, chug some coffee, and make it to an 8:30am meeting. Do this 5-7 days a week for a decade or so, and you get a rough sense of how intense and demanding the job can be. (It does get less insane in the private sector, though there are still crunch times...)\n\nAll of this is to say... you just have to LOVE the actual day-to-day work, and believe deeply that you're helping to change the country for the better, or you'll burn out really quickly.\n\nIf you thrive on the writing challenge, though, there's no better way to make a living. There's an old (possibly apocryphal) story about Churchill writing a speech for the King in which he points out, since the King was reading his words, \\*he\\* was, effectively, the King of England... until the speech was over. Obviously this overstates the speechwriter's importance, but it's true that your work reaches audiences/makes news/moves policy with the full power and authority of your speaker, which is a pretty insane feeling. And if you're not too stressed or sleep-deprived to appreciate them (which you often are), the perks -- like having philosophical discussions with the Attorney General of the United States on an FBI jet, hanging out at the White House, being whisked around by motorcade, etc. -- are pretty tough to beat.\n\nIt also helps to be innately curious, since part of the job is leaping from one topic to the next... and if you don't enjoy learning about one thing after another, it would be an insufferable slog. Finally, as I mentioned in another answer, it's crucial to care \\*the right amount\\* about your work: enough to do a great job, but not so much that you bristle at edits or feel insulted when a speaker gives you negative feedback (since it's their speech, not yours, at the end of the day).",

Unlike a lot of other political jobs, nepotism/connections won't get you very far unless you have the raw skills... and those skills are highly prized/tend to speak for themselves even without connections (for instance, I came to DC with zero connections/experience/donor relationships, worked really hard to get good at what I do, and have been amazed at how many doors have opened pretty easily as a result).\n\nThis also means your education/qualifications aren't hugely important. If you have the writing chops and the smarts/skills to communicate clearly under crazy pressure, that's all that really counts; I don't have a law or graduate degree, and I don't know many speechwriters who do. I can't recommend Capitol Hill enough -- it's a phenomenal learning environment for a speechwriter (and a fun place to work), though it can be a tough place to break through/get your first gig. On a campaign, it's somewhat easier to get a foot in the door; you just have to show the boss you're really good at something, and it more or less becomes your job (which also means you need to be REALLY CAREFUL what you show people you're good at). In any event, the key is to write (and consume great writing) as much as possible. That dream job is absolutely achievable if you put in the shoe leather.\n\nGood luck!",

Often there's an explicit call to action -- \"vote for me, donate to X, support Y.\" But you're never going to win *every* argument.

What I always tell young or aspiring speechwriters is that one of the keys to success is learning to care *the right amount* about your work.

At the end of the day, as you point out, it's *their* speech -- and *their* name and reputation on the line. So anything beyond your honest-to-God best professional advice (pushing back on edits that make the speech objectively less effective/might get them in trouble/be taken out of context, etc.) is pure ego.

        "body": "Great questions!\n\n1. It really depends. I try to encourage speakers to invest as much of themselves on the front end as possible, so that -- when they see a first draft -- it reflects the way they talk/think and feels authentically theirs. As a result, especially with people I've worked with for years, edits are usually very minimal. On the other hand, some people NEED to get under the hood and mess around pretty extensively, so to speak, to internalize a speech/make it their own. As long as the speaker is happy with the finished result (and there isn't TOO much churn along the way), I'm pretty agnostic about how we get there!\n\n2. Every speech starts with single combat: one writer vs. the blank page. In my current life as a freelancer, that's basically it -- I write a draft and send it to the client, who either edits directly or runs it through a vetting process (subject matter experts, comms people, senior advisors, etc.). The same was true on campaigns and Capitol Hill, where I was the boss's only speechwriter. At DOJ, I started at AG Holder's deputy on a team of two (plus an intern) before becoming chief speechwriter, and I hired an additional deputy (so my total team was 4, including an intern). There -- and later, when I worked at a speechwriting firm -- I'd take some drafts myself and assign others to coworkers, then revise/polish their drafts.\n\n3. Usually, I'm the one coming up with the outline/helping to develop the message, based on the speaker's objectives and the audience's expectations. In most cases, these are smart but insanely busy people who have serious chops/are brimming with ideas... but lack either the skill set or the time to communicate their ideas as clearly and effectively as possible.

I try to encourage speakers to invest as much of themselves on the front end as possible, so that -- when they see a first draft -- it reflects the way they talk/think and feels authentically theirs. As a result, especially with people I&amp;#39;ve worked with for years, edits are usually very minimal. On the other hand, some people NEED to get under the hood and mess around pretty extensively, so to speak, to internalize a speech/make it their own. As long as the speaker is happy with the finished result (and there isn&amp;#39;t TOO much churn along the way), I&amp;#39;m pretty agnostic about how we get there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every speech starts with single combat: one writer vs. the blank page. In my current life as a freelancer, that&amp;#39;s basically it -- I write a draft and send it to the client, who either edits directly or runs it through a vetting process (subject matter experts, comms people, senior advisors, etc.). The same was true on campaigns and Capitol Hill, where I was the boss&amp;#39;s only speechwriter. At DOJ, I started at AG Holder&amp;#39;s deputy on a team of two (plus an intern) before becoming chief speechwriter, and I hired an additional deputy (so my total team was 4, including an intern). There -- and later, when I worked at a speechwriting firm -- I&amp;#39;d take some drafts myself and assign others to coworkers, then revise/polish their drafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, I&amp;#39;m the one coming up with the outline/helping to develop the message, based on the speaker&amp;#39;s objectives and the audience&amp;#39;s expectations. In most cases, these are smart but insanely busy people who have serious chops/are brimming with ideas... but lack either the skill set or the time to communicate their ideas as clearly and effectively as possible. Which means I get to engage with the speaker at the level of ideas and (ideally) have a rich/rewarding collaboration to get something on paper that&amp;#39;ll (ideally) get an audience on its feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Emotion is key, and statistics need to be used sparingly and with ample context or (studies show) they turn people off. I also firmly believe no speech should be longer than 20 minutes; after all, sitcoms are ~22min for a reason (that's about how long you can sustain people's attention, even if you're crushing it).\n\nIn a book, you have a lot more room to breathe. Rhythm is less important, since you don't need to worry about your speaker tripping over things. You can (and should) wander much further into the weeds, so to speak, than would ever be advisable in a speech, so you can load up the proof points and let your argument play itself out more comprehensively.\n\nIn both cases, crisp/clear language, engaging storytelling, and smart structure are key -- but the single most important ingredient is authenticity. If you're writing for someone else, this means ensuring the speech or book reflects the person's voice AND their thinking: the connections and associations that define and shade in the structure of the argument.\n\nIn both cases, you'll want to spend as much time with the speaker/author as possible (to develop a nuanced sense of their voice/thinking); the best projects are the ones in which your brilliant-but-busy client has a million smart things to say, but needs an expert's help to say them effectively. One obvious difference is the time involved: a speech usually takes me anywhere from a few hours to a few days to write, while a book affords months (in some cases as much as a year/18 months) to research more deeply and write more reflectively.",

I also firmly believe no speech should be longer than 20 minutes; after all, sitcoms are ~22min for a reason (that&amp;#39;s about how long you can sustain people&amp;#39;s attention, even if you&amp;#39;re crushing it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a book, you have a lot more room to breathe. Rhythm is less important, since you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about your speaker tripping over things. You can (and should) wander much further into the weeds, so to speak, than would ever be advisable in a speech, so you can load up the proof points and let your argument play itself out more comprehensively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In both cases, crisp/clear language, engaging storytelling, and smart structure are key -- but the single most important ingredient is authenticity. If you&amp;#39;re writing for someone else, this means ensuring the speech or book reflects the person&amp;#39;s voice AND their thinking: the connections and associations that define and shade in the structure of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you&amp;#39;ll want to spend as much time with the speaker/author as possible (to develop a nuanced sense of their voice/thinking); the best projects are the ones in which your brilliant-but-busy client has a million smart things to say, but needs an expert&amp;#39;s help to say them effectively. One obvious difference is the time involved: a speech usually takes me anywhere from a few hours to a few days to write, while a book affords months (in some cases as much as a year/18 months) to research more deeply and write more reflectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
