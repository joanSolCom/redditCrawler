The problem that drives up the cost (see this 1” tee on McMaster, one of the cheapest suppliers: [https://www.mcmaster.com/5482K169/](https://www.mcmaster.com/5482K169/)) is the difficulty of manufacturing these fittings from 316L stainless steel to the precision required for aerospace while being able to withstand pressures sometimes upwards of 10,000 psi. Machining is a very expensive but often overlooked part of rocketry, and skilled machinists (especially welders) on payroll can often make the difference between success and failure for rocketry companies",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;actually, there’s a lot of specifications involved. Just fittings (the connectors I mentioned earlier) can be according to the Army-Navy standard, the National Pipe Thread standard, the Compressed Gas Association standard, Swagelok’s proprietary system, the BOSS standard, and that’s only scratching the surface of all the different fitting types. The problem that drives up the cost (see this 1” tee on McMaster, one of the cheapest suppliers: &lt;a href=\"https://www.mcmaster.com/5482K169/\"&gt;https://www.mcmaster.com/5482K169/&lt;/a&gt;) is the difficulty of manufacturing these fittings from 316L stainless steel to the precision required for aerospace while being able to withstand pressures sometimes upwards of 10,000 psi. Machining is a very expensive but often overlooked part of rocketry, and skilled machinists (especially welders) on payroll can often make the difference between success and failure for rocketry companies&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It’s really beautiful and the coolest place in downtown. Around 7:15am we would wrap up practice and I would hit my most productive part of my day until my 9:30am classes. I had classes until 4pm and then I would do some homework and work on projects late into the night.\n\nSo yes, super hectic but I have learned that writing it all down and taking hard notes, I know some people use Google Calendar but that never works for me, so I write it all in a journal. Ultimately, to continue loving what you are doing you need to relax and take care of yourself. I exercise and do what I want when I have the chance so that I do not burn out too quickly. I sometimes just cut myself off and take a break. Honestly, I prioritize sleep over homework.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick rundown of my typical schedule. Before COVID I was on the Rowing Team here at UT Austin. I had 4:45am practice on Lady Bird Lake that flows through downtown Austin. It’s really beautiful and the coolest place in downtown. Around 7:15am we would wrap up practice and I would hit my most productive part of my day until my 9:30am classes. I had classes until 4pm and then I would do some homework and work on projects late into the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, super hectic but I have learned that writing it all down and taking hard notes, I know some people use Google Calendar but that never works for me, so I write it all in a journal. Ultimately, to continue loving what you are doing you need to relax and take care of yourself. I exercise and do what I want when I have the chance so that I do not burn out too quickly. I sometimes just cut myself off and take a break. Honestly, I prioritize sleep over homework.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "A great question, sounds like they are thinking like an engineer already! The lack of oxygen changes quite a few things about how the rocket must be made versus an airplane that has plenty of ambient air.   \n\n\nThe first is that the rocket has to carry its own oxygen. For almost all combustion engines, you require a fuel to burn (rocket propellant in our case) and oxygen to make the combustion happen. Cars and airplanes can use the oxygen around them to make the combustion happen, while a rocket has to carry liquid oxygen to use once it is in space.  \n\n\nThe other key point is that without air, the fins that \"shape\" the air around them and allow the rocket to change direction – like the wings of an aircraft – have nothing to push off of. So rocket scientists will put something called a gimbal on the bottom of the engine that allows them to point and fire it in slightly different directions, or they use an RCS. An RCS is a reaction control system which is like tiny little engines placed along the body of the rocket, which will fire and push the nose of a rocket a certain way. Think like the bow thrusters on very large boats",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great question, sounds like they are thinking like an engineer already! The lack of oxygen changes quite a few things about how the rocket must be made versus an airplane that has plenty of ambient air.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first is that the rocket has to carry its own oxygen. For almost all combustion engines, you require a fuel to burn (rocket propellant in our case) and oxygen to make the combustion happen. Cars and airplanes can use the oxygen around them to make the combustion happen, while a rocket has to carry liquid oxygen to use once it is in space.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other key point is that without air, the fins that &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; the air around them and allow the rocket to change direction – like the wings of an aircraft – have nothing to push off of. So rocket scientists will put something called a gimbal on the bottom of the engine that allows them to point and fire it in slightly different directions, or they use an RCS. An RCS is a reaction control system which is like tiny little engines placed along the body of the rocket, which will fire and push the nose of a rocket a certain way. Think like the bow thrusters on very large boats&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In the movie, Ken Miles (the Ford driver), stays up late to tinker with parts in the racecar to bring the car to its highest potential, for nights on end The grind it takes to really improve something is something found in every industry but is very prevalent in the rocket business. The pay-off comes when you see something you built or contributed to do its job. That feeling of fulfillment is what motivates me through the hardest part of the grind the same way it probably did for Ken.

In the movie, Ken Miles (the Ford driver), stays up late to tinker with parts in the racecar to bring the car to its highest potential, for nights on end The grind it takes to really improve something is something found in every industry but is very prevalent in the rocket business. The pay-off comes when you see something you built or contributed to do its job. That feeling of fulfillment is what motivates me through the hardest part of the grind the same way it probably did for Ken. The passion, hustle, and drive 📷 seen in Ford vs. Ferrari matches my feelings when I’m working on rockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
