I held the world record on TypeRacer from 2010 to 2016, on Nitro Type from 2012 to 2018, and on 10FastFingers from 2015 to 2019, becoming the only person to hold the world record on all three of the most famous typing sites simultaneously.  Recently, several people have surpassed my top speeds, but I still am regarded as having the fastest average in general.  I have also won international championships, winning the Intersteno championship for fastest mother tongue typing six times ('10-'11, '13, '15-16, and '18) and the championship for typing across multiple languages twice ('11 and '12.)  In the 2011 Intersteno contest, I set the fastest speed in nine different languages, tying Dan Chen's record for the most all time.\n\nI am writing a book on the history of competitive typing titled Nerds Per Minute.  This book will cover the entire history of typing from the invention of the mechanical typewriter to the modern Internet age.  I recently launched a Patreon in the middle of April (https://www.patreon.com/seanwrona) where I am releasing one chapter on the 15th and one on the 30th of every month, with a scheduled completion date of December 15.  The first two chapters will cover the invention of the typewriter, the development of the QWERTY keyboard and the home row method, and the early typing contests of the 1800s.  The next three will cover the history of the international typing championships that were held from 1906-1946, when typing was considered a big deal and typists toured the nation like rock stars and competed at venues like Madison Square Garden and Carnegie Hall, which are still massive today.  Chapters 6-8 will discuss respectively: the research of August Dvorak and the history of his keyboard layout, the history of international typing, particularly the Intersteno contest and its live events dating back to the 1950s, and the late 20th century typists of the mass media age (Cortez Peters, Jr., Ron Mingo, Barbara Blackburn, Michael Shestov, and so on.)\n\nThe last nine chapters from 9-17 focus on the current typing scene.  Chapter 9 will discuss the history of typing computer applications, starting with the early DOS era typing games from the '80s but mostly focusing on the six online sites (other than Intersteno) that I consider historically important: TyperA, Typing Zone, hi-games.net, 10FastFingers, TypeRacer, and Nitro Type.  Chapter 10 will focus on the first wave of online typing stars that predated me.  The next three chapters will be biographical about myself, and I talk a lot about the Ultimate Typing Championship in Chapter 12.  Chapter 14 will discuss the wave of typing stars after me.  Chapter 15 will center on the streaming of typing games on Twitch, culminating in a discussion of The Clicking Championship, the most famous online typing championship.  The next chapter will provide research I conducted on the fastest and slowest keys on the keyboard as well as which parts of the keyboard and individual words are faster than others.  The final chapter goes into great detail about why I think the home row method is wrong, which fingers I use to type each letter of the keyboard, and when I make deviations.  The second half is almost done, but the first half is hardly written yet.  Having said that, I've already done most of the research I need to for that first half I believe.\n\nI also have numerous unrelated hobbies as well.  I launched a website http://www.race-database.com/ where I archived the entire history of most of the major league racing series, but I abandoned after 2015.  That year, I created a spinoff http://www.racermetrics.com/ where I began creating my own advanced statistical analyses for auto racing in the same vein as what sabermetrics is for baseball.  When I finish this book, I think my next project will be a ranking of the top 1000 drivers in motorsports history across all racing series.  I also am a tournament Scrabble expert (https://www.cross-tables.com/results.php?playerid=21019) and won one tournament in 2015 but I haven't played in a few years.  If you want to talk to me about racing, Scrabble, or anything else, that's certainly fair game too.\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/arenasnow\n\nTwitter proof: https://twitter.com/seanwrona/status/1253551421301166080\n\nEDIT: I didn't realize that it would go live again when I responded to a post.
