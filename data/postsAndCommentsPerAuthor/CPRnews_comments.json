If you get it, can you not get it again? How effective is a vaccine? It's likely even with a vaccine COVID-19 could reoccur, so you might see (hopefully smaller) outbreaks the way we do with H1N1.

Our daily talk show &lt;a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/colorado-matters/id174890525\"&gt;Colorado Matters&lt;/a&gt; is particularly good for that kind of perspective, as is our &lt;a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/at-a-distance/id1504922745\"&gt;podcast At A Distance&lt;/a&gt;. Hang in there. - KS + JD&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Going to the bathroom is pretty basic, it's mind-blowing that they can't figure that one out. \n\nI don't know, specifically, if RTD has looked at other cities. A transit advocate in NYC told me last week that it's certainly not unique to Denver. Drivers say the schedules are too tight, and that passengers get mad when buses run late b/c they have to run to the loo. RTD says they've never disciplined drivers for using the bathroom, but the union says drivers have been disciplined for peeing in public.   \n\n\n&gt; Also, how much of RTD's budget goes into infrastructure maintenance and upkeep?  \n\nCheck page 31 here for some very top-level data on that. \\~8% of their 2018 revenue went to \"services,\" which includes maintenance (and a bunch of other stuff). More generally, they measure their assets' condition on a 0-5 scale, [and according to this presentation](http://rtd.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=30&amp;ID=8260) from last year, their bus and light rail systems scored 4.1 and 4.0 respectively. Their systems are pretty new and have nowhere near the maintenance problems that older ones do, [like the MTA in New York.](https://ny.curbed.com/2019/2/21/18235190/woodside-queens-subway-track-impales-car-windshield)   \n\n\n\\- NM",

Going to the bathroom is pretty basic, it&amp;#39;s mind-blowing that they can&amp;#39;t figure that one out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, specifically, if RTD has looked at other cities. A transit advocate in NYC told me last week that it&amp;#39;s certainly not unique to Denver. Drivers say the schedules are too tight, and that passengers get mad when buses run late b/c they have to run to the loo. RTD says they&amp;#39;ve never disciplined drivers for using the bathroom, but the union says drivers have been disciplined for peeing in public.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, how much of RTD&amp;#39;s budget goes into infrastructure maintenance and upkeep?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check page 31 here for some very top-level data on that. ~8% of their 2018 revenue went to &amp;quot;services,&amp;quot; which includes maintenance (and a bunch of other stuff). More generally, they measure their assets&amp;#39; condition on a 0-5 scale, &lt;a href=\"http://rtd.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=30&amp;amp;ID=8260\"&gt;and according to this presentation&lt;/a&gt; from last year, their bus and light rail systems scored 4.1 and 4.0 respectively. Their systems are pretty new and have nowhere near the maintenance problems that older ones do, &lt;a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2019/2/21/18235190/woodside-queens-subway-track-impales-car-windshield\"&gt;like the MTA in New York.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- NM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But [as the WHO said yesterday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/who-officials-say-its-unclear-whether-recovered-coronavirus-patients-are-immune-to-second-infection.html), we don't really know what immunity looks like for this virus. If you get it, can you not get it again? How effective is a vaccine? It's likely even with a vaccine COVID-19 could reoccur, so you might see (hopefully smaller) outbreaks the way we do with H1N1. And Colorado and the U.S. more generally doesn't mandate flu vaccines in most cases, and the state has exemptions for other vaccinations, too. So there will always be limits to that approach. \n\nTo get a sense of what the next couple years would look like, [this paper published in Science today might be helpful](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/14/science.abb5793). \n\nI also found these two news bits (from the Atlantic and the National Review respectively) helpful today for starting to parse out what our future might look like: \n\n[Our Pandemic Summer](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/) and [Scott Gottlieb of AEI](https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/the-editors/special-episode-scott-gottlieb-md-206/). \n\nWe'll also be continuing to dog this. I think it's important to be reporting out beyond just what's happening today, so we'll be talking to the state, public health departments and experts to parse out what the future looks like.\n\nI also hear in your question perhaps a bit of a desire for certainty right now: a vision of how this will go. And I'd just say: No one knows for sure. We have some precedent in the Spanish Flu but there are just too many factors about how we behave and how the virus behaves. So the problem becomes more than an epidemiological one. It becomes a cultural and emotional one, of how to deal with what is certain to be a long process (and a disease we may end up dealing with for the rest of our lives as we do with the flu and other infectious diseases). \n\nA reporter I really respect tweeted out this on what recovery from a disaster is like and I have found it quite helpful for contextualizing where we are: \n\n[https://twitter.com/jane\\_c\\_hu/status/1249799114759405568](https://twitter.com/jane_c_hu/status/1249799114759405568)\n\n We will try and play our part by reviewing information we get so that you get the proper context and you can have some faith in what you hear from us.

The number of state tests seems to have dropped in recent days, but private or hospital labs are doing quite a few tests, in total \\~1700 on Sunday for example. But that doesn't actually seem to include all the negative tests from state labs.

The number of state tests seems to have dropped in recent days, but private or hospital labs are doing quite a few tests, in total ~1700 on Sunday for example. But that doesn&amp;#39;t actually seem to include all the negative tests from state labs. This is a really important factor in safely lifting the stay-at-home order so we are VERY curious about the state&amp;#39;s plans for ramping up the number of tests. - KS&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think the biggest thing I wish people understood on social media and in our audience is to be careful and considerate news consumers. \n\nThis is a very good time to read closely and understand the limits of what's being reported. I'd love to see more discussion of the limits of the science and the numbers we have. This is of course coming from a journalist, but it's a great time to come from a place of curiosity and understanding. *Ask lots of questions!* In the public health sphere, I feel very hungry for more information and discussion of underlying conditions and what the virus actually does to the body. Some reports indicate it has effects well beyond the respiratory system, so the heart and digestion as well. [This piece from the Washington Post about that was so devastating and illuminating](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/04/12/storm-inside/?arc404=true).\n\nI'd also love more discussion and reporting *(ahem, John*) on why the medical system in particular has struggled to respond. We've heard so much about supply chains and the political preparations for pandemics. But are we missing something about what happened in hospitals? This is really testing the systems we have. Why were they built like this? \n\n**From John:** \n\nThis is rapidly becoming, or perhaps already is, the most thoroughly covered news story of all time. Or at least seems be.  More than World War II...hmm, I'd have to think about that.  Who knows?  \n\nAnyway, a lot of this has been and is being covered and reported on and discussed.  I think one thing that can't be discussed too often is the power of community and positivity. I realize that sounds really squishy, but humans are nothing if not social beings. That means we are driven by, inspired by, moved by collective action. Sometimes that can be troubling, but what we are capable of by working together is truly breathtaking.  And I think we will and are seeing that now and that will help lead us through all of this. So I look to great examples of people being kind, helping each other, working together. That I believe will make all of the difference.  \n\nFor example, [if you scroll down to the 9:36 am item in our daily live blog from a few days ago](https://www.cpr.org/2020/04/07/colorado-coronavirus-updates-closures-testing-cases-and-more-21/), you'll see a great example of folks expressing gratitude to the front line health workers.  I think actions like this can and will make all of the difference, and probably don't get discussed enough. ",

Some reports indicate it has effects well beyond the respiratory system, so the heart and digestion as well. &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/04/12/storm-inside/?arc404=true\"&gt;This piece from the Washington Post about that was so devastating and illuminating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also love more discussion and reporting &lt;em&gt;(ahem, John&lt;/em&gt;) on why the medical system in particular has struggled to respond. We&amp;#39;ve heard so much about supply chains and the political preparations for pandemics. But are we missing something about what happened in hospitals? This is really testing the systems we have. Why were they built like this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From John:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is rapidly becoming, or perhaps already is, the most thoroughly covered news story of all time. Or at least seems be.  More than World War II...hmm, I&amp;#39;d have to think about that.  Who knows?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a lot of this has been and is being covered and reported on and discussed.  I think one thing that can&amp;#39;t be discussed too often is the power of community and positivity. I realize that sounds really squishy, but humans are nothing if not social beings. That means we are driven by, inspired by, moved by collective action. Sometimes that can be troubling, but what we are capable of by working together is truly breathtaking.  And I think we will and are seeing that now and that will help lead us through all of this. So I look to great examples of people being kind, helping each other, working together. That I believe will make all of the difference.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2020/04/07/colorado-coronavirus-updates-closures-testing-cases-and-more-21/\"&gt;if you scroll down to the 9:36 am item in our daily live blog from a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll see a great example of folks expressing gratitude to the front line health workers.  I think actions like this can and will make all of the difference, and probably don&amp;#39;t get discussed enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There **\\*have\\*** been tests done on how long the virus stays in a detectable state on various kinds of surfaces and under different environmental conditions.\n\nI found this one particularly interesting: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext)\n\nThis is nerdy as heck but if you go in the supplementary materials of that paper, they have charts showing roughly how long the virus is detectable on paper, glass, masks etc.\n\nTL;DR it lasts a lot shorter on paper materials than on hard ones (or on masks!). So maybe be more careful of plastic containers than paper ones? Maybe? I'm sure I'll say this again in this chat, but it's really important to remember that science is always an ongoing conversation and right now, it's more like a speed-dating round.\n\nThere's just so much changing day to day and there's little I can confidently say we know for sure about how the virus behaves. \\*\\*Our rule of thumb for reporting information is to run it by at least one other researcher, and we typically don't report on a single study. So we look across a body of research and say: What is in common here? What is different?  -\\*\\*KS\n\n**P.S. One more thing:** When in doubt, wipe it down well with bleach, or high-concentration ethanol/sanitizer. You can find a chart showing what each disinfectant does to detection of the virus in those same supplementary materials 😎",

There &lt;strong&gt;*have\\&lt;/strong&gt;* been tests done on how long the virus stays in a detectable state on various kinds of surfaces and under different environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this one particularly interesting: &lt;a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20\"&gt;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;30003-3/fulltext)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is nerdy as heck but if you go in the supplementary materials of that paper, they have charts showing roughly how long the virus is detectable on paper, glass, masks etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR it lasts a lot shorter on paper materials than on hard ones (or on masks!). So maybe be more careful of plastic containers than paper ones? Maybe? I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll say this again in this chat, but it&amp;#39;s really important to remember that science is always an ongoing conversation and right now, it&amp;#39;s more like a speed-dating round.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just so much changing day to day and there&amp;#39;s little I can confidently say we know for sure about how the virus behaves. **Our rule of thumb for reporting information is to run it by at least one other researcher, and we typically don&amp;#39;t report on a single study. So we look across a body of research and say: What is in common here? What is different?  -**KS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. One more thing:&lt;/strong&gt; When in doubt, wipe it down well with bleach, or high-concentration ethanol/sanitizer. You can find a chart showing what each disinfectant does to detection of the virus in those same supplementary materials 😎&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

They looked at whether the number of short-distance rides went down (hypothesizing that these could be attributed to riders scootin' instead), and it hadn't. (Trying to find the source for that, but it was discussed in a recent board meeting).\n\n\\- A [dissertation by a CU Denver grad student](http://www.cpr.org/news/story/two-ways-uber-and-lyft-are-clogging-denver-area-streets-and-one-way-they-re-helping) suggests that Uber/Lyft cannibalize transit use. I'd love to see more research looking into the relationship between the two.\n\n\\- But RTD's partnered directly with Uber on a pretty deep level (you can buy RTD tickets in the Uber app). They say they just want to raise their profile. [I wrote about that last winter.](https://www.cpr.org/2019/01/31/in-a-first-uber-to-integrate-transit-routes-for-denver-area-app-users/)\n\n\\- NM",

They looked at whether the number of short-distance rides went down (hypothesizing that these could be attributed to riders scootin&amp;#39; instead), and it hadn&amp;#39;t. (Trying to find the source for that, but it was discussed in a recent board meeting).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- A &lt;a href=\"http://www.cpr.org/news/story/two-ways-uber-and-lyft-are-clogging-denver-area-streets-and-one-way-they-re-helping\"&gt;dissertation by a CU Denver grad student&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Uber/Lyft cannibalize transit use. I&amp;#39;d love to see more research looking into the relationship between the two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- But RTD&amp;#39;s partnered directly with Uber on a pretty deep level (you can buy RTD tickets in the Uber app). They say they just want to raise their profile. &lt;a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2019/01/31/in-a-first-uber-to-integrate-transit-routes-for-denver-area-app-users/\"&gt;I wrote about that last winter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- NM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
