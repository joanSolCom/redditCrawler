The publisher would prefer the writer to love the cover, post it all over social media and proudly market the book. But ultimately the cover is the publisher's call. \n\nHaving a good agent helps. An experienced agent knows what it's worth pushing for or not, and they can even get some things added to the contract (e.g. we added a clause that I would be consulted on the audiobook narrator because it was important for me that the British accents were good!). \n\nAs I mentioned in another answer, when it came to editing the text itself, I did more editorial work with my agent than the publisher. I was happy with all the changes I made with both and I only pushed back hard on one suggestion (something that would have lessened the historical accuracy). The editor at the publisher listened to my reasoning and ultimately agreed with me.\n\nThe publisher/writer relationship is a business relationship. Everyone wants it to be a healthy business relationship where the writer feels creatively fulfilled and ideally everyone makes money from the book selling well.",

However, it&amp;#39;s in everyone&amp;#39;s best interests for the writer to be happy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take the cover? The publisher would prefer the writer to love the cover, post it all over social media and proudly market the book. But ultimately the cover is the publisher&amp;#39;s call. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having a good agent helps. An experienced agent knows what it&amp;#39;s worth pushing for or not, and they can even get some things added to the contract (e.g. we added a clause that I would be consulted on the audiobook narrator because it was important for me that the British accents were good!). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in another answer, when it came to editing the text itself, I did more editorial work with my agent than the publisher. I was happy with all the changes I made with both and I only pushed back hard on one suggestion (something that would have lessened the historical accuracy). The editor at the publisher listened to my reasoning and ultimately agreed with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The publisher/writer relationship is a business relationship. Everyone wants it to be a healthy business relationship where the writer feels creatively fulfilled and ideally everyone makes money from the book selling well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Dear Danielle,\n\nI am querying you as we have similar reading taste (I also love Wuthering Heights, Rebecca and anything by Jane Austen) and I thought my historical novel, BRONTË’S MISTRESS, might be of interest to you.\n\nYorkshire, 1843.\n\nLydia Robinson is mistress of Thorp Green Hall—or at least she should be. But her daughters are rebelling, her mother-in-law is scrutinising her every move and her marriage is hanging by a thread following the death of her beloved younger daughter a year earlier. \n\nThat’s when Branwell Brontë arrives to act as her son’s tutor. Branwell is imaginative, passionate and uninhibited by the social conventions that Lydia has followed without question since her girlhood. He’s also twenty-five to Lydia’s forty-three and oh so very easy to manipulate. \n\nA love of literature, music and theatre soon bring mistress and tutor together but Lydia is being watched—and not just by her husband. Her servants and the governess (Branwell’s judgmental sister Anne) are starting to ask questions. Her daughters are embarking on romantic entanglements of their own. \n\nWith her husband’s health failing, Branwell’s behaviour growing more erratic and exposure threatened from several quarters, it’s up to Lydia to create a chance for her own happiness. Can she find meaning in her life without losing her children along the way?\n\nBRONTË’S MISTRESS, complete at 80,000 words, is the true and previously untold story of the woman Mrs Gaskell called \"that bad woman who corrupted Branwell Brontë\".

But her daughters are rebelling, her mother-in-law is scrutinising her every move and her marriage is hanging by a thread following the death of her beloved younger daughter a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s when Branwell Brontë arrives to act as her son’s tutor. Branwell is imaginative, passionate and uninhibited by the social conventions that Lydia has followed without question since her girlhood. He’s also twenty-five to Lydia’s forty-three and oh so very easy to manipulate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A love of literature, music and theatre soon bring mistress and tutor together but Lydia is being watched—and not just by her husband. Her servants and the governess (Branwell’s judgmental sister Anne) are starting to ask questions. Her daughters are embarking on romantic entanglements of their own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With her husband’s health failing, Branwell’s behaviour growing more erratic and exposure threatened from several quarters, it’s up to Lydia to create a chance for her own happiness.
