More likely, the current members of the RNC, which represent the states, would vote on behalf of those states. The RNC rules say that the three RNC members from each state cast the votes representing the delegates from that state. If they disagree, they’d divide up those votes proportionally. \n\nThey do not need to choose the vice presidential nominee to replace the president. \n\nBut it is already getting close to the election. Many people have already voted. So it’s probably too late to replace a candidate’s name on the ballot.
