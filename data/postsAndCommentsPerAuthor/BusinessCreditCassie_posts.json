        "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

                "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

                "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

                "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

                "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

                "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about &lt;strong&gt;1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Businesses everywhere are struggling, and I&amp;#39;m here to help any way I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do all of the following for funding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you&amp;#39;re outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge\"&gt;More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab\"&gt;More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.com/\"&gt;Business Credit Lab&amp;#39;s website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152\"&gt;Proof on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge\"&gt;More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab\"&gt;More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.com/\"&gt;Business Credit Lab&amp;#39;s website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152\"&gt;Proof on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                "selftext": "Hi Reddit, Cassie from Business Credit Lab, and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBusinesses everywhere are struggling, and I'm here to help any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home, but in the end, we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking for funding, none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers, or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing, but I had no idea it existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also several other ways to fund a business, and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA, who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through, and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2020, my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe do all of the following for funding:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit, Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months), Revenue Lending, Merchant Cash Advances, Account Receivable Financing, Purchase Order Financing, Startup Unsecured Business Financing, Book-of-business Financing, 401k Financing, Securities Financing, Commercial Vehicle Financing, Commercial Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Investment, Equity Investments, Inventory Financing, Equipment Financing, Equipment-Sale-Leaseback, SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications, Term Loans, Business Lines-of-Credit, House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options, so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options and programs are generally for US-based businesses, but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[More about the Build Your Business 21 Day Challenge here](https://businesscreditlab.com/challenge).\n\n[More about my full program, Business Credit Lab, here.](https://businesscreditlab.safechkout.net/Lab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Business Credit Lab's website here where we can connect if you want to talk about funding.](https://businesscreditlab.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*In no particular order, I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores, stack different types of funding, get out of dead-end jobs, skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit), fund their dream business, and grow existing businesses.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYo personalmente no hablo español (tomé francés en la escuela secundaria), pero el director de mi departamento de financiación habla español como su primer idioma\n\n[Proof on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thatcassieprice/status/1300930308481585152)",

I'm not a mod, but I've seen posts where he isn't able to get back to everyone. Remember, he's an unpaid volunteer who is also running his own business. If you email him and don't hear back, don't despair.\n\n**Here are some things to try if you're stuck processing/funds aren't dispersed/you had a bank error and funds are in limbo/your bank rejects your funds/you're being asked to provide the same docs over and over again.**\n\nYou aren't stuck if you applied two weeks ago and haven't gotten a portal. You aren't stuck if you if you've been processing for 10 days. **Please check the** [**FAQ for the latest timelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EIDL/comments/gqluc9/read_this_first_official_frequently_asked/) **and only use these if you are outside what Cue is saying is the norm.**\n\n[Number Nine in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EIDL/comments/gqluc9/read_this_first_official_frequently_asked/) talks about getting your rep involved and then your application possibly getting white-glove treatment. I think that's your best course of action to hurry things along but some Reps are more motivated than others.\n\nIf you have a [Senator](https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/committeemembers) or [Congressperson](https://smallbusiness.house.gov/about/membership.htm) on the SBA committee, I would start there. If not, someone you've donated to might help. I never used to think it matters and now I think it might.\n\nYour Congressperson might have less on their plate than a Senator but who knows. It also depends on the size of your state.\n\nYou can find your [Senators here](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). You can find your [Reps here](https://www.house.gov/representatives).\n\n**Make sure you have filled out**  \\###### **their privacy release form so they can contact the SBA on your behalf. Otherwise, they are just listening and not doing anything.**\n\nMy Senator's office just told my neighbor that the SBA was taking \"a week or two\" to respond to Congressional requests. Back in June it was 48 hours or less.\n\nAs listed in [FAQ Number Nine](https://www.reddit.com/r/EIDL/comments/gqluc9/read_this_first_official_frequently_asked/), you should politely suggest that your Rep reach out to the SBA at [focwcongressionalinquiries@sba.gov](mailto:focwcongressionalinquiries@sba.gov)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**You can also try reaching out to your SBA Regional or District Director.**\n\n[https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find/](https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find/)\n\nTheir email is [firstname.lastname@sba.gov](mailto:firstname.lastname@sba.gov). Try to reverse google search their email to make sure that's actually it. If someone is Tom, they might be listed as Thomas, etc. If you google you can probably narrow it down.\n\nOne of my friends reached out to his Regional Director about a stalled app. He applied May 3rd. Heard back the next day from someone in his office.\n\nThey can't do anything per se, but they can tell you where your file is at and the notations in it. And I have a feeling if it's getting too dumb (like being asked for the same docs over and over again) they can probably find the right person to fix it. My friend said when the office colleague wrote back there were two additional people on the cc line. One was the Supervisory Lender Relations Specialist for the region and he's hoping that somehow helps.\n\nThat same person also said recons are taking 3-4 weeks.\n\nMy friend didn't know why he was declined. Never got the snail mail. But the SBA person was able to tell him why and give him a copy of the letter. This was more than either Tier 1 or Tier 2 were able to do. She also told him that his file didn't have anything about reconsideration in it yet. He sent everything in for reconsideration on 8/4.\n\n**To expedite your reconsideration and not get stuck in a paperwork request loop, I suggest you submit the following in the first email you send based on what I've seen others do:**\n\n1. A cover letter explaining why you want more funds/messed up your COGS, whatever it is. Be clear. Be concise. (Body of the email)\n2. [SBA Form 3502](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/SBA_Form_3502_Economic_Injury_Disaster_Loan_Supporting_Information.pdf) which is the official request and the paper version of what you've already filled out. (as a PDF)\n3. Your P&amp;L's (Profit and Loss statements) (as a PDF)\n4. [IRS Form 4506-T](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf) to authorize the release of your tax transcripts (PDF)\n5. Your business tax returns for 2019. (PDF)\n6. Front and back of your driver's license/passport. Some people have been asked for an SSN card. Your call whether you want to start with that. (PDF)\n\nTitle it \"Loan Modification Increase Loan Number XXXXX\"  and send your package to [pdcrecons@sba.gov](mailto:pdcrecons@sba.gov).\n\nDon't make the SBA open Word docs or weird files. PDF's are easy to scan for viruses and readable on everything. Make it easy for them.\n\nMy friend who heard back from someone at the regional office was told P&amp;L's should be ok since they hadn't filed taxes yet as 2019 was their first year in business. Cue says in FAQ 20 that P&amp;L's aren't enough for COGS error, so be prepared for that. It might depend on the loan officer.\n\nThe regional person also suggested to have personal tax returns on hand but not submit them unless asked (for the friend who hasn't filed business taxes yet).\n\nu/Scorpio14534,  or anyone else, do you know if you can get your own transcripts and submit those or does SBA need to pull them? If someone replies in the comments I'll update the post.\n\nOther people have been asked for and you might want to gather to have on hand:\n\n1. Voided business check\n2. Certificate of Good Standing (you get these from the Secretary of State where you are domiciled)\n3. Business registrations (meaning Secretary of State incorporation filings. Your attorney might have these, or Legal Zoom or your registered agent.)\n4. Business License if required for your industry/state/city\n\n*This last list seems LO dependent but best to have on hand. Some states are easier to pull these docs from than others.*\n\nGood luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.\n\n[Tip your Cue.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/cue378-tip-jar)  \n\n\nEdit:  \n\n\nYour loan officer will probably call you. The most common phone number seems to be 800-366-6303. Put it in your address book. If you've got an iPhone, add it to your Favorites and Allow Favorites if you use Do Not Disturb. ",

Back in June it was 48 hours or less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As listed in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EIDL/comments/gqluc9/read_this_first_official_frequently_asked/\"&gt;FAQ Number Nine&lt;/a&gt;, you should politely suggest that your Rep reach out to the SBA at [&lt;a href=\"mailto:focwcongressionalinquiries@sba.gov\"&gt;focwcongressionalinquiries@sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:focwcongressionalinquiries@sba.gov\"&gt;focwcongressionalinquiries@sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also try reaching out to your SBA Regional or District Director.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find/\"&gt;https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their email is [&lt;a href=\"mailto:firstname.lastname@sba.gov\"&gt;firstname.lastname@sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:firstname.lastname@sba.gov\"&gt;firstname.lastname@sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;). Try to reverse google search their email to make sure that&amp;#39;s actually it. If someone is Tom, they might be listed as Thomas, etc. If you google you can probably narrow it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my friends reached out to his Regional Director about a stalled app. He applied May 3rd. Heard back the next day from someone in his office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t do anything per se, but they can tell you where your file is at and the notations in it. And I have a feeling if it&amp;#39;s getting too dumb (like being asked for the same docs over and over again) they can probably find the right person to fix it. My friend said when the office colleague wrote back there were two additional people on the cc line. One was the Supervisory Lender Relations Specialist for the region and he&amp;#39;s hoping that somehow helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same person also said recons are taking 3-4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend didn&amp;#39;t know why he was declined. Never got the snail mail. But the SBA person was able to tell him why and give him a copy of the letter. This was more than either Tier 1 or Tier 2 were able to do. She also told him that his file didn&amp;#39;t have anything about reconsideration in it yet. He sent everything in for reconsideration on 8/4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To expedite your reconsideration and not get stuck in a paperwork request loop, I suggest you submit the following in the first email you send based on what I&amp;#39;ve seen others do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A cover letter explaining why you want more funds/messed up your COGS, whatever it is. Be clear. Be concise. (Body of the email)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/SBA_Form_3502_Economic_Injury_Disaster_Loan_Supporting_Information.pdf\"&gt;SBA Form 3502&lt;/a&gt; which is the official request and the paper version of what you&amp;#39;ve already filled out. (as a PDF)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your P&amp;amp;L&amp;#39;s (Profit and Loss statements) (as a PDF)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf\"&gt;IRS Form 4506-T&lt;/a&gt; to authorize the release of your tax transcripts (PDF)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your business tax returns for 2019. (PDF)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Front and back of your driver&amp;#39;s license/passport. Some people have been asked for an SSN card. Your call whether you want to start with that. (PDF)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Title it &amp;quot;Loan Modification Increase Loan Number XXXXX&amp;quot;  and send your package to [&lt;a href=\"mailto:pdcrecons@sba.gov\"&gt;pdcrecons@sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:pdcrecons@sba.gov\"&gt;pdcrecons@sba.gov&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make the SBA open Word docs or weird files. PDF&amp;#39;s are easy to scan for viruses and readable on everything. Make it easy for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend who heard back from someone at the regional office was told P&amp;amp;L&amp;#39;s should be ok since they hadn&amp;#39;t filed taxes yet as 2019 was their first year in business. Cue says in FAQ 20 that P&amp;amp;L&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t enough for COGS error, so be prepared for that. It might depend on the loan officer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The regional person also suggested to have personal tax returns on hand but not submit them unless asked (for the friend who hasn&amp;#39;t filed business taxes yet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Scorpio14534\"&gt;u/Scorpio14534&lt;/a&gt;,  or anyone else, do you know if you can get your own transcripts and submit those or does SBA need to pull them? If someone replies in the comments I&amp;#39;ll update the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other people have been asked for and you might want to gather to have on hand:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Voided business check&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Certificate of Good Standing (you get these from the Secretary of State where you are domiciled)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Business registrations (meaning Secretary of State incorporation filings. Your attorney might have these, or Legal Zoom or your registered agent.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Business License if required for your industry/state/city&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last list seems LO dependent but best to have on hand. Some states are easier to pull these docs from than others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/cue378-tip-jar\"&gt;Tip your Cue.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your loan officer will probably call you. The most common phone number seems to be 800-366-6303. Put it in your address book. If you&amp;#39;ve got an iPhone, add it to your Favorites and Allow Favorites if you use Do Not Disturb. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
