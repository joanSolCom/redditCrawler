The idea is to briefly reflect on what your life would be like if some person you cared about didn't exist. Like if they died, or you never met them. That simple ten-second strategy can break up hedonic adaptation a bit and let you realize just how grateful you are to have people in your life.

The first is self-compassion— basically not beating yourself up about not being the perfect parent. A lot of parenting expectations are ones we inadvertently put on ourselves. So dialing back the self-shaming can be really powerful. \n\nA second piece of advice would be to focus on the stress itself. We can’t control our stressful circumstances, but there are lots of ways stop making it worse. We can do that by prioritizing behaviors that fight stress— exercise, making sure we get enough sleep, connecting with our social supports. But we can also directly act in ways that regulate our stress response through our breath. A lot of the physical feelings of stress come from our fight or flight system, the sympathetic nervous system. But we can put the breaks on that system by engaging its counterpart, the parasympathetic nervous system. That one is our rest and digest system. And we can kick that into high gear simply by taking a few slow, deep belly breaths, which engage our vagus nerve. So the next time parenting is causing that stress response, literally stop to take a few deep breaths. I know it’s advice that sounds lame, but scientifically speaking, it works!",

It’s an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this— Buddha asks his followers if it’s bad to get hit with an arrow when you’re walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if it’s worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control— that’s all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events— whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.\n\nAnd so I’d say the biggest insight that’s had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow. I even have my friends remind me when I’m not following this advice by texting me a pair of arrow emojis. It works wonders, so it’s a practice I’d have you have your own friends help with.\n\nSo yeah, that insight has been huge!",
