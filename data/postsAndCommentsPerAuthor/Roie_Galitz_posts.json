My intimate video and still photography is a strong testimony to the struggle of the majestic animals I meet throughout my expeditions, under the threats of climate change.\n\nTo help protect them, I share their stories and use my photography to impact change. I was a Keynote Public Speaker at the United Nations Climate Week, at conventions around the world, and led three TEDx Talks about wildlife conservation. My work has been featured in many publications including National Geographic and BBC (Check out \"Snow Bears,\" narrated by Kate Winslet).\n\nMy video and still photography have won over 130 international awards, and have been presented at exhibitions around the world. I am also an ambassador for Nikon, Gitzo, Lowepro, and G-Technology.\n\nIn 2007, I founded the largest photography school in Israel, called the Galitz School of Photography, and we are starting online courses in English, for any beginner photographers who would like to join. In 2010, I founded Phototeva Expeditions, one of the world’s top 10 photography expeditions companies, for anyone who's looking to join me on my travels once the virus is over!\n\nCheck out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/roiegalitz/?hl=en) for cute animals on the daily.

My intimate video and still photography is a strong testimony to the struggle of the majestic animals I meet throughout my expeditions, under the threats of climate change.\n\nTo help protect them, I share their stories and use my photography to impact change. I was a Keynote Public Speaker at the United Nations Climate Week, at conventions around the world, and led three TEDx Talks about wildlife conservation. My work has been featured in many publications including National Geographic and BBC (Check out \"Snow Bears,\" narrated by Kate Winslet).\n\nMy video and still photography have won over 130 international awards, and have been presented at exhibitions around the world. I am also an ambassador for Nikon, Gitzo, Lowepro, and G-Technology.\n\nIn 2007, I founded the largest photography school in Israel, called the Galitz School of Photography, and we are starting online courses in English, for any beginner photographers who would like to join. In 2010, I founded Phototeva Expeditions, one of the world’s top 10 photography expeditions companies, for anyone who's looking to join me on my travels once the virus is over!\n\nCheck out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/roiegalitz/?hl=en) for cute animals on the daily.
