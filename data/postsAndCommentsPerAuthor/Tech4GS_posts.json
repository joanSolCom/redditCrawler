In this role, he was responsible for the development of presidential policy on cybersecurity, and built and managed federal processes for cyber incident response and vulnerability management. He has testified before Congress on cybersecurity information sharing and on the problem of attribution in cyberspace and written and lectured extensively on cybersecurity policy. His work focuses on Internet governance, public-private partnerships, and cyber conflict.

Since entering the Internet industry in 1985, Bill has helped establish more than three hundred Internet exchange points. In 1989, Bill developed the anycast routing technique that now protects the domain name system. In 1998 he was one of the principal drivers of California 17538.4, the world’s first anti-spam legislation. Bill was principal author of the Multicast DNS and Operator Requirements of Infrastructure Management Methods IETF drafts. In 2002 he co-founded INOC-DBA, the security-coordination hotline system that interconnects the network operations centers of more than three thousand ISPs around the world. And in 2007, Bill was one of the two international liaisons deployed by NSP-Sec to the Estonian CERT during the Russian cyber-attack. In 2011, Bill authored the first survey of Internet interconnection agreements, as input to the OECD’s analysis of the Internet economy. Bill serves on the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, and the Commission on Caribbean Communications Resilience. He&amp;#39;s on the board of directors of the M3AA Foundation, and was on the board of the American Registry for Internet Numbers for fifteen years. Now, Bill’s work focuses principally on the security and economic stability of critical Internet infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He has testified before Congress on cybersecurity information sharing and on the problem of attribution in cyberspace and written and lectured extensively on cybersecurity policy.
