I know that that sounds a little corny but it's the truth.\n\nThe biggest thing anyone can do is to add ALT text or alternative text to images. You may be surprised to know that screen readers can't guess what a picture is. There is new AI that tries to guess but it can be really frustrating when you end up on a website and all it says is button, button, button. or Image Image Image and you have no idea what you are supposed to be clicking on to get to the right heading or link. Most apps including Instagram and web builders have the options in advanced settings to add alt text to images, buttons, and links. If it doesn't it's always nice to add a description right underneath the photo for those of us who can't see what the picture is. \n\nI really love puzzle and adventure games. An oldie, which has huge nostalgia for me is World of Xeen. It's one we played over and over growing up. Most people have never heard of it but it's well worth the dosbox download! Runs a whole 256 colours! haha I also enjoyed the first Myst game, and have had some fun failing terribly at Fortnite. Really anything that's got a great story and easy controls is something I'll get into.",
