As a result, we self-host mostly, which admittedly takes a lot more resources than say just trusting Amazon AWS. Also, all of our data stays on Canada's soil.\n&gt; \n&gt; I too am a fan of jurisdictional sovereignty, but how do you deal with routing? IXmapsresearch shows that much domestic Canadian internet traffic is routed via the US (aka 'boomerang' routing). Is this a concern for you? If so, what can be done about it?\n\nIt is definitely a concern, not only for trans-border which IXMaps is great at highlighting for Canadians, but I assume there are network taps on our own soil as well -- the focus here should be to ensure man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can't happen during encrypted transport. As these days this is mostly web applications, in my organizations we're mandating TLS 1.3 (formerly SSL -- https:// instead of http:// for all apps). This does not prevent MITM attacks, it just enforces encryption between the contractor/employee/founder and the web application. To solve the MITM concern, we also implement [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/03/17/95-of-https-servers-vulnerable-to-trivial-mitm-attacks.html).  \n\nAs an industry, we need a next generation of TLS that solves this better -- Cloudflare has single handedly demonstrated TLS MITM is possible at scale. Say for example, you setup a website that takes personal information for something controversial like planned parenthood or cannabis purchases. If that website uses Cloudflare, the default/free option of Cloudflare will provide you a TLS/SSL certificate. This means your website, will now show up to users with the green lock in the browser, and show https:// instead of http://, insinuating to the user it's a secure and trusted website they're connected to. What's important to note though, is this just sets up a secure connection between the user and Cloudflare -- once the data gets to Cloudflare, they do what's called SSL termination -- they decrypt the encrypted stream! They argue they do this for your protection so they can make sure there's no malicious payload in the data stream, but it means they can read/collect/log all of the data/content in this scenario. It's so bad, at this stage they might even send that data from their service unencrypted for the rest of the connection between them and the webserver, allowing others to intercept the traffic at the same time as them. All of this is technical I realize, but it means that TLS/SSL is effectively broken as it can't be trusted from a generalized use perspective -- you as a non-technical user have no idea if the secure website you're submitting your private/personal data to is actually a website being \"protected\" by Cloudflare. This isn't intended to pick on Cloudflare per se, they have some extremely technically savvy security folks and surely intend well, they're just the elephant in the room in this context. There are many other companies besides Cloudflare that also offer what I toungue-in-cheek refer to MITMaaS (man-in-the-middle-as-a-service) solutions -- for your protection of course.\n\nA bit of a digression, but to answer in a more direct way, any data that is going over any public network, should be encrypted in transit, and you should ensure the technology is not susceptible to a MITM. We as an industry need a technical solution that does this without one having to be a technical security expert. \n \n&gt;     you have little repercussions for misuse\n&gt; \n&gt; Might you mean \"little recourse for misuse\"?\n\nyes, thanks!",

There are data leakage, data misuse, misuse of privileged access, account misuse, and many other things that are happening. What would you recommend for these businesses as a starting point? Framework/policy-wise and tools wise?\n\nMake sure your IT team is evaluating the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for any application you are developing or using, as well as actually reading the privacy policy and terms of service. \n\nWhen consulting with SMEs, I use a hybrid checklist I've built over the years that is a mix between the [CISSP domains](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Webcast-Series) and the [SOC2 checklist](https://blog.rsisecurity.com/a-detailed-soc-2-compliance-checklist/) as a starting point.\n\n\n&gt; . Directly accessing tools/resources via cloud vs remote logging in to office and then work from there. What do you recommend?\n\nNone of my companies in the last 5 years have used any American or Australian tech services. I'm a big fan of jurisdictional sovereignty. As Stephanie mentioned in another thread, once your data leaves your soil, you have little repercussions for misuse. As a result, we self-host mostly, which admittedly takes a lot more resources than say just trusting Amazon AWS. Also, all of our data stays on Canada's soil. If we have a product or service in another country, say Germany, all of that data and tools stays on German soil -- but this is hard to scale. As an entrepreneur, my startups are still small enough that this is manageable. \n\nI've always been against trusting \"the cloud\", as it still is just a fun way of saying you trust your data on someone else's computer. It takes some technical competence and resources to hold this position however. \n \n&gt;     As the weakest link in the Cyber Security posture, users often create risks to be exploited. What can we do to educate users?\n\nIt requires priority of the leadership, and once (if) priority is established, then it takes resources -- such as bringing in trainers. \n \n&gt;     IoT devices are common and vulnerable. Brings in a new attack vector by the loads into companies. What are the practical ways we can address them?\n\nThe s in IoT stands for security. \n \n&gt;     What are the new trends you see in Blue team side? PAM, IAM, SIEM, DLP, WAF was the keywords we were hearing mostly and wondering if there are new concepts.\n\nI wish more resources were spent on interacting with the technical experts and advocates than the vendors, but I'm biased. \n\nIn terms of 2020 information security trends, you've asked about the big/new/unexpected one which is the transition to work-from-home solutions and processes, as well as business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery planning (DRP). Supply chain and local resiliency considerations have also come to the forefront year in terms of global economy, not discounting Geo-political considerations (for example UIS/China/Russia) which will see an increase in government budgets around \"cybersecurity\" -- which also emphasize the privacy and security skills gaps. AI/ML, and IoT security considerations will continue to climb. \nAs mentioned above, true buy-in from your organization's leadership team is likely the biggest gap, and once that hurdle has been crossed, developing a privacy (and security) training strategy is a good second step -- so that you know what to ask for yourself in terms of needs specific to your organization.",

If (when!) FINTRAC's data is compromised in a couple of years, one will likely be able to see all legal transactions made using virtual currencies, and that is a notable risk to all Canadians, from my perspective.   \n\n\nIn terms of cryptocurrency and AML/CTF, there don't seem to be any moderates in the discussions, and to me that is dangerous. You're either of the belief everything should be private and anonymous which has inherent dangers as well, or you believe we should just trust our government to monitor all of our virtual currency transactions -- and the \"nothing to hide\" argument has been debunked for over a decade and is dangerous.  \n\n\n\\[1\\] KYC = Know your Customer, the act of verifying you with your ID.

This process is more important than your idea -- as we've discovered that even having an idea you're emotionally attached to taints the discovery process. \n\nWhat I suggest is finding a market you have access to at least 1,000 people of, as you want 10-30 (1-3%) of that market to give you the time to ask some open ended questions to find the market need. We have a small cohort of [problem finders](https://www.confidenceo.com/services/problemfinding/) right now and I look forward to publishing the results by the end of the year. Of course the data might be skewed in what is an unusual year, but we're convinced our method should work under even unusual economic conditions like this. \n\nAlso maybe worth noting, my co-founder and I are adamant that seeking financing to validate your idea is a terrible model -- and we need to stop idolizing companies based on how much they can raise. *A successful business we should prioritize on valuing is one who bootstraps through paying customers and through perseverance finds a market fit.* \n\nTL;DR: Spend your time finding the pain points and unmet needs of your target market.

        "body": "&gt;     I'm a big fan of jurisdictional sovereignty. As Stephanie mentioned in another thread, once your data leaves your soil, you have little repercussions for misuse. As a result, we self-host mostly, which admittedly takes a lot more resources than say just trusting Amazon AWS. Also, all of our data stays on Canada's soil.\n&gt; \n&gt; I too am a fan of jurisdictional sovereignty, but how do you deal with routing? IXmapsresearch shows that much domestic Canadian internet traffic is routed via the US (aka 'boomerang' routing). Is this a concern for you? If so, what can be done about it?\n\nIt is definitely a concern, not only for trans-border which IXMaps is great at highlighting for Canadians, but I assume there are network taps on our own soil as well -- the focus here should be to ensure man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can't happen during encrypted transport. As these days this is mostly web applications, in my organizations we're mandating TLS 1.3 (formerly SSL -- https:// instead of http:// for all apps). This does not prevent MITM attacks, it just enforces encryption between the contractor/employee/founder and the web application. To solve the MITM concern, we also implement [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/03/17/95-of-https-servers-vulnerable-to-trivial-mitm-attacks.html).  \n\nAs an industry, we need a next generation of TLS that solves this better -- Cloudflare has single handedly demonstrated TLS MITM is possible at scale. Say for example, you setup a website that takes personal information for something controversial like planned parenthood or cannabis purchases. If that website uses Cloudflare, the default/free option of Cloudflare will provide you a TLS/SSL certificate. This means your website, will now show up to users with the green lock in the browser, and show https:// instead of http://, insinuating to the user it's a secure and trusted website they're connected to. What's important to note though, is this just sets up a secure connection between the user and Cloudflare -- once the data gets to Cloudflare, they do what's called SSL termination -- they decrypt the encrypted stream! They argue they do this for your protection so they can make sure there's no malicious payload in the data stream, but it means they can read/collect/log all of the data/content in this scenario.

This isn't intended to pick on Cloudflare per se, they have some extremely technically savvy security folks and surely intend well, they're just the elephant in the room in this context.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I&amp;#39;m a big fan of jurisdictional sovereignty. As Stephanie mentioned in another thread, once your data leaves your soil, you have little repercussions for misuse. As a result, we self-host mostly, which admittedly takes a lot more resources than say just trusting Amazon AWS. Also, all of our data stays on Canada&amp;#39;s soil.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I too am a fan of jurisdictional sovereignty, but how do you deal with routing? IXmapsresearch shows that much domestic Canadian internet traffic is routed via the US (aka &amp;#39;boomerang&amp;#39; routing). Is this a concern for you? If so, what can be done about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is definitely a concern, not only for trans-border which IXMaps is great at highlighting for Canadians, but I assume there are network taps on our own soil as well -- the focus here should be to ensure man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can&amp;#39;t happen during encrypted transport. As these days this is mostly web applications, in my organizations we&amp;#39;re mandating TLS 1.3 (formerly SSL -- https:// instead of http:// for all apps). This does not prevent MITM attacks, it just enforces encryption between the contractor/employee/founder and the web application. To solve the MITM concern, we also implement &lt;a href=\"https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/03/17/95-of-https-servers-vulnerable-to-trivial-mitm-attacks.html\"&gt;HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an industry, we need a next generation of TLS that solves this better -- Cloudflare has single handedly demonstrated TLS MITM is possible at scale. Say for example, you setup a website that takes personal information for something controversial like planned parenthood or cannabis purchases. If that website uses Cloudflare, the default/free option of Cloudflare will provide you a TLS/SSL certificate. This means your website, will now show up to users with the green lock in the browser, and show https:// instead of http://, insinuating to the user it&amp;#39;s a secure and trusted website they&amp;#39;re connected to. What&amp;#39;s important to note though, is this just sets up a secure connection between the user and Cloudflare -- once the data gets to Cloudflare, they do what&amp;#39;s called SSL termination -- they decrypt the encrypted stream! They argue they do this for your protection so they can make sure there&amp;#39;s no malicious payload in the data stream, but it means they can read/collect/log all of the data/content in this scenario. It&amp;#39;s so bad, at this stage they might even send that data from their service unencrypted for the rest of the connection between them and the webserver, allowing others to intercept the traffic at the same time as them. All of this is technical I realize, but it means that TLS/SSL is effectively broken as it can&amp;#39;t be trusted from a generalized use perspective -- you as a non-technical user have no idea if the secure website you&amp;#39;re submitting your private/personal data to is actually a website being &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; by Cloudflare.

Many of the Small-Medium Business sector isn't ready in their IT security front for working from home situation. There are data leakage, data misuse, misuse of privileged access, account misuse, and many other things that are happening. What would you recommend for these businesses as a starting point? Framework/policy-wise and tools wise?\n\nMake sure your IT team is evaluating the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for any application you are developing or using, as well as actually reading the privacy policy and terms of service. \n\nWhen consulting with SMEs, I use a hybrid checklist I've built over the years that is a mix between the [CISSP domains](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Webcast-Series) and the [SOC2 checklist](https://blog.rsisecurity.com/a-detailed-soc-2-compliance-checklist/) as a starting point.\n\n\n&gt; . Directly accessing tools/resources via cloud vs remote logging in to office and then work from there. What do you recommend?\n\nNone of my companies in the last 5 years have used any American or Australian tech services. I'm a big fan of jurisdictional sovereignty. As Stephanie mentioned in another thread, once your data leaves your soil, you have little repercussions for misuse. As a result, we self-host mostly, which admittedly takes a lot more resources than say just trusting Amazon AWS. Also, all of our data stays on Canada's soil.

As an entrepreneur, my startups are still small enough that this is manageable. \n\nI've always been against trusting \"the cloud\", as it still is just a fun way of saying you trust your data on someone else's computer. It takes some technical competence and resources to hold this position however. \n \n&gt;     As the weakest link in the Cyber Security posture, users often create risks to be exploited.

Supply chain and local resiliency considerations have also come to the forefront year in terms of global economy, not discounting Geo-political considerations (for example UIS/China/Russia) which will see an increase in government budgets around \"cybersecurity\" -- which also emphasize the privacy and security skills gaps. AI/ML, and IoT security considerations will continue to climb. \nAs mentioned above, true buy-in from your organization's leadership team is likely the biggest gap, and once that hurdle has been crossed, developing a privacy (and security) training strategy is a good second step -- so that you know what to ask for yourself in terms of needs specific to your organization.",

I find what works best is explaining the technical aspects at an &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/\"&gt;r/ELI5&lt;/a&gt; level, and follow that up with stories/narratives/examples. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Digital images often have extra data attached to them called EXIF data, make sure you remove the EXIF data before sharing an image, as can include the details of your camera, and your location. \nJohn MacAfee was hiding out in a homicide investigation in Belize, and was only &lt;a href=\"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/12/03/john-mcafee-location-exif/\"&gt;discovered to be in a forest in Guatemala because Vice editor posted a photo with the EXIF&lt;/a&gt; data attached. \nThere was a webcam worker who had a window in the background in her videos, and because of objects and shadows seen outside the window, someone was able to determine her location. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These stories likely hold more weight in memory as different parts of the narratives will resonate with different people for different reasons, and emotion is attached, so it&amp;#39;s better than just saying &amp;quot;Think about what&amp;#39;s in the background of your pictures and videos that an attacker may use to find your location&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once someone&amp;#39;s privacy has been violated, they&amp;#39;ll pay attention to any/all privacy issues after that, as there&amp;#39;s usually no turning back from the context of when privacy is/was seriously violated. Forcing someone to take action on privacy doesn&amp;#39;t work as well as finding a reason and explaining why they should care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There are very few, if any left, that give attention to the privacy advocates. The current Canadian privacy conference landscape is mostly corporate agendas talking to policy makers about their solutions, in my observation.   \n\n2. My background is in technical security where I did quite well, and with a move across the country I realized my passion was in privacy -- and this is an industry that still lacks technical expertise. It is mostly lawyers and policy makers. I found my niche back in 2005 by reaching out to every organization I could find in the country that prioritized on individuals privacy -- and have since been an advisor to most privacy forward organizations in Canada since. I also became one of the first international trainers for the IAPP which is still the industry standard for privacy professionals -- but I am no longer working with them and do not endorse them in any capacity.  \n\n3. Unfortunately most of the private sector hires privacy consultants to understand how to draft privacy policies to maintain the collection, sale and sharing of personal information using loopholes known in the law, or clever wording in privacy policies and notices. I think the best policies I've seen are effectively two policies in one -- one that is simple and plain English the user can understand and don't find intimidating to read, that links each section directly to the lawyer approved privacy policy sections.",

There are several privacy related conferences, but most of them are now just money making shill machines. There are very few, if any left, that give attention to the privacy advocates. The current Canadian privacy conference landscape is mostly corporate agendas talking to policy makers about their solutions, in my observation.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My background is in technical security where I did quite well, and with a move across the country I realized my passion was in privacy -- and this is an industry that still lacks technical expertise. It is mostly lawyers and policy makers. I found my niche back in 2005 by reaching out to every organization I could find in the country that prioritized on individuals privacy -- and have since been an advisor to most privacy forward organizations in Canada since. I also became one of the first international trainers for the IAPP which is still the industry standard for privacy professionals -- but I am no longer working with them and do not endorse them in any capacity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately most of the private sector hires privacy consultants to understand how to draft privacy policies to maintain the collection, sale and sharing of personal information using loopholes known in the law, or clever wording in privacy policies and notices. I think the best policies I&amp;#39;ve seen are effectively two policies in one -- one that is simple and plain English the user can understand and don&amp;#39;t find intimidating to read, that links each section directly to the lawyer approved privacy policy sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think most of the Canadian cryptocurrency community underestimates the privacy impact of the financial surveillance apparatus that will begin/result with these changes on June 1st. Transactions will be logged and reported like never before.   \n\n\nIt is my speculation that this will create a splinter from the grey area now, to realizing if you use bitcoin or trackable cryptocurrency solutions, you will be tracked throughout your transaction history (including the KYC/AML/CTF \\[1\\] heavy on and off ramps), or you will move to the privacy coins (Monero/zcash/dash) or services like coinjoin which make tracking impossible or at least near impossible -- and it's foreseeable that these will be considered illegal as a result.   \n\n\nI don't believe triggered reports will change such as suspicious transaction reports (STRs) or large cash transaction reports (LCTRs) of anything over 10k, or anything that appears to be stacking, but what will be reported about you and the transaction details will increase notably.   \n\n\nIn the meantime, the solutions I mention above, like privacy coins and coinjoin will keep your privacy, but we have to ensure law makers understand there are many legal uses for cryptocurrency, and that the tracking of them, while useful for AML/CTF, creates many liabilities. If (when!) FINTRAC's data is compromised in a couple of years, one will likely be able to see all legal transactions made using virtual currencies, and that is a notable risk to all Canadians, from my perspective.   \n\n\nIn terms of cryptocurrency and AML/CTF, there don't seem to be any moderates in the discussions, and to me that is dangerous. You're either of the belief everything should be private and anonymous which has inherent dangers as well, or you believe we should just trust our government to monitor all of our virtual currency transactions -- and the \"nothing to hide\" argument has been debunked for over a decade and is dangerous.  \n\n\n\\[1\\] KYC = Know your Customer, the act of verifying you with your ID.

I registered the domain with \"Ad min\" as my name, as I didn't want my full name in public whois. (Funny for hams to read, as my name is/was searchable on Industry Canada's website based on the domain name if anyone really cared). Anyway, CIRA literally stole my domain name from me, and refused to give it back.

I registered the domain with &amp;quot;Ad min&amp;quot; as my name, as I didn&amp;#39;t want my full name in public whois. (Funny for hams to read, as my name is/was searchable on Industry Canada&amp;#39;s website based on the domain name if anyone really cared). Anyway, CIRA literally stole my domain name from me, and refused to give it back. I had tried and tried to negotiate with them a way to give them my real name without it being in public whois and they refused.

I don’t say that  to suggest my experience is worse, I’m a middle aged white guy — I’m  writing this with privilege and empathy.\n\nChinatown, where I live at least, is a few blocks away from the epicenter of poverty and addiction in Canada, the [downtown east side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Eastside).\n\nI  witness people in poverty and addiction yelling racist and/or sexist  inappropriate comments almost daily. Yesterday I witnessed an Asian  woman get pushed to the ground. When a woman or an Asian person is  walking alone, and crossing paths with someone who is mentally unwell,  it is common for me to observe or hear something that makes me want to  intervene, but I often don’t.\n\nThere are a few reasons I don’t, but  I’m open to suggestions. The first one is that my intervention is  likely to escalate the issue just by intervening, compounded by my lack  of skills in de-escalation, it’s hard not to let emotions over ride,  which is what the vulnerable person is seeking — a little tasty of power  and control, where they live a life as vulnerable.\n\nAnother action  I could take is to call the police, but even with an assault, such as  the one I witnessed yesterday, the police surprisingly happened to be on  the block I was on, so they were forced to join the scene and quickly  interact, just enough to de-escalate the tension and then walk off  within 2 minutes of the assault. As soon as the police left, it  re-escalated. Not to fault the police — what would it take of their time  to press assault charges, based on the word of mostly homeless and  addicted observers.\n\nAs a result, the tensions continue, the less  safe, or in the least the less welcome my Asian and female friends feel  walking alone in the neighbourhood, and I’m not sure what we can do to  resolve the issue.\n\nI am still convinced it needs to be done with  compassion, and empathy, as no one who is happy with themselves needs to  make another feel unwelcome.\n\nFor anyone who identifies as even  slightly empathetic, this is a good check in with your capabilities on  maturely handling your emotions. Receiving such feedback from someone  who is intoxicated, or suffers from mental health &amp; addiction is not  unlike receiving it from a child. Choosing to react to it, letting it  get to you, or escalating the issue, would likely do nothing productive  other than satisfy the antagonist.",

No one has taken me up on it yet. \nThe thing is, we all have something to hide, and that differs from each of us. Would you put live webcams in your bathroom and bedroom? If not, you have something to hide. \n\nThe second point, is that privacy is not just about anonymity to me. A few years ago I coined the term \"Privacy is consent\", as consent is a loaded term in our culture. I would add privacy is informed consent now, but I digress. \n\nThe last part, which is a longer story, is that privacy is like a frog in a pot on the stove, where the water is getting warmer. People feel that with breaches like Equifax, and Cambridge Analytica, that the privacy water was boiling, and they didn't feel any weighted impacts from it, so who cares. As someone who's done privacy investigations for years, I can say without hesitation that once your privacy has been violated, when the water has actually hit boiling, you'll never ignore privacy again. For example, if you're a young woman and an ex has doxxed your nude photos to a slut-shaming website, or shared around your school, that young woman will never ignore privacy for the rest of her life. \n\nCompanies are all about collecting your data, and they're motivated to not let the privacy waters feel like they're boiling -- but does that means you want to turn the water temperature up by providing them more of your personal information? Heck no, and when societal shifts of the water boiling happens, it's never reversible. You can't take your information back from Facebook that they have. You can't take the nude pictures back you sent your ex-boyfriend. If you're a Canadian who is now banned from the US because they have evidence you used your VISA or Mastercard to buy cannabis, which is a federal US crime, you can't take that purchase back. \n\nIf you ever have specific privacy questions, send me a message here, or ask me on twitter (I'm @cqwww there also), and if it's a non-specific-to-you question, I'll likely answer it on [my blog](http://www.privasectech.com/the-blog/) so others can benefit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Liberals in this riding are really pushing the vote-by-fear, or strategic voting line, as it's in their interest. \nIn my electoral district, the Conservatives in all polls since the election started, have polled under 18%, so it's not an issue here. That is assuming you trust the polls, which are mostly landline phone calls -- which is mostly Conservative voters. \n\nElection campaigns are all about momentum. So if everyone is saying \"We're going Green\", we'll go green. If the buzz is \"vote out Harper out of fear at all other costs\", things will likely end badly. Mainly, because there is no valid evidence to base the decision of strategic voting from. \n\nIn Vancouver Quadra, as of writing this, you can vote for who you feel will represent you the best. \n\nIt can all change in a day though. In the last 48 hours, the Liberal campaign co-chair and 2nd in command, Dan Gagnier (Justin Trudeau's \"Nigel Wright\") just got caught secretly telling TransCanada what steps they need to take to get the pipelines to tidal water after this election. This has never happened in Canada before, such a back room deal before votes have even been counted. It is precedent setting. It could devastate the Liberals, or have no impact.  \n\nThis story helps me, as throughout the campaign I've been asking Joyce Murray (Liberal) publicly if she will vote no to pipelines and tankers if Justin Trudeau tells her she has to (She's in a whipped vote party). She's ignored my question, and been assuring the public in debates the Liberals will build a rigorous process that the pipeline companies will never be able to pass, as soon as the election finishes. She's been convincing. Now with this news, that trust is completely gone. It shows the true agenda. \n\nTo address your question directly, I don't think making compromises is necessary generally, and especially in this election, in this riding. A vote for Green builds momentum for the party even if for the next campaign. Also, there are financial benefits. For example, if I get [10% of the vote, I get 60% of the paid election expenses and paid personal expenses](http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=can/man/ec20155&amp;document=p5&amp;lang=e). That's a big deal, as it means we don't have to start over again next election from scratch with fundraising. \n\n",

So if everyone is saying &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going Green&amp;quot;, we&amp;#39;ll go green. If the buzz is &amp;quot;vote out Harper out of fear at all other costs&amp;quot;, things will likely end badly. Mainly, because there is no valid evidence to base the decision of strategic voting from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Vancouver Quadra, as of writing this, you can vote for who you feel will represent you the best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can all change in a day though. In the last 48 hours, the Liberal campaign co-chair and 2nd in command, Dan Gagnier (Justin Trudeau&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Nigel Wright&amp;quot;) just got caught secretly telling TransCanada what steps they need to take to get the pipelines to tidal water after this election. This has never happened in Canada before, such a back room deal before votes have even been counted. It is precedent setting. It could devastate the Liberals, or have no impact.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story helps me, as throughout the campaign I&amp;#39;ve been asking Joyce Murray (Liberal) publicly if she will vote no to pipelines and tankers if Justin Trudeau tells her she has to (She&amp;#39;s in a whipped vote party). She&amp;#39;s ignored my question, and been assuring the public in debates the Liberals will build a rigorous process that the pipeline companies will never be able to pass, as soon as the election finishes. She&amp;#39;s been convincing. Now with this news, that trust is completely gone. It shows the true agenda. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To address your question directly, I don&amp;#39;t think making compromises is necessary generally, and especially in this election, in this riding. A vote for Green builds momentum for the party even if for the next campaign. Also, there are financial benefits. For example, if I get &lt;a href=\"http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;amp;dir=can/man/ec20155&amp;amp;document=p5&amp;amp;lang=e\"&gt;10% of the vote, I get 60% of the paid election expenses and paid personal expenses&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s a big deal, as it means we don&amp;#39;t have to start over again next election from scratch with fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Otherwise, take some time and read all of the party platforms to see which one reflects your values. Start by reading [Vision Green](https://www.greenparty.ca/en/vision-green), which impressed me to the point it's a party that meets my values. Finally I don't have to vote for the party I dislike the least. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges with the NDP, Liberals, or Conservative MPs, is they are all victims of party discipline. They vote how the are told, not what their constituents want. This alone has a lot of people voting Green now. Greens are committed to passing a law that prevents whipped voting from all political parties.\n\nMy thoughts on Snowden? There's not that many people in our lifetime who will take such a principled and public stance, risking their lives and livelihoods, to make the world better. I think it's a challenge to all of us, what values do we have that would cause us to make such a principled stance. \nObama campaigned as the champion of whistleblowers, however he seems to have done more against whistleblowers than any president in U.S. history. I would love to see developed countries do more to protect whistleblowers. There should be a metric for developed countries, that involves the user trust level of whistle blowing systems. \n\nI have been fighting to enhance security for about 15 years professionally, the last 10 focused on privacy. At the end of the day, you need a government that is representing you. If you don't have that, you need to vote to change that. Right now, even the system itself is gamed.

The Liberals are alleging they are, but are ignoring proportional representation and promising to do an 18 month consult with Canadians. This is strategic, as it's not expected the next minority government will last long enough for them to change it, and they can innocently shrug that they tried. \n\nI would [like an immediate review of CCIRC](http://www.voteconstable.com/enhancing-security-against-cyber-attacks/) to evaluate their performance to date to understand its effectiveness.

This demonstrates how the system is broken. Not one Conservative or Liberal MP represented their constituents by supporting this bill. There is only one requirement of Member of Parliament (MP) under the constitution, and that's to represent their constituents. The NDP, Liberals, and Conservatives have all been failing at this. \n\nTo this day, the Liberal Party of Canada have not addressed exactly what they'd amend with Bill C-51. This is interesting, as it's in the top 5 election issues at the door, and they've had many months and the longest election campaign ever to disclose their intentions, but have refused to do so. \n\nIf you want to end the surveillance culture, do not give the Liberals or Conservatives your vote. \n \n",

The NDP, Liberals, and Conservatives have all been failing at this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this day, the Liberal Party of Canada have not addressed exactly what they&amp;#39;d amend with Bill C-51. This is interesting, as it&amp;#39;s in the top 5 election issues at the door, and they&amp;#39;ve had many months and the longest election campaign ever to disclose their intentions, but have refused to do so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to end the surveillance culture, do not give the Liberals or Conservatives your vote. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I&amp;#39;m aware that all of these things don&amp;#39;t make them fool proof, for example OpenSSL over the last year. It&amp;#39;s a model I hope we all support philosophically and financially, as the more encryption tools are publicly audited by 3rd parties, the better for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have clients that won&amp;#39;t touch open source, and I have clients that will only touch open source, and have heard the same from others even this week, so I&amp;#39;m aware of the pros and cons of both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Because it seems mostly about power and control. The US in the process of undoing many their draconian laws because 14 years has shown they're not successful or cost effective, and in Canada we're still pushing in the non-democratic direction. I would argue our existing laws are sufficient. \n\nI personally would prefer that laws were drafted that the majority of Canadians agree with, and that are evidence based.

It&amp;#39;s a law being passed which Canadians overwhelmingly don&amp;#39;t agree with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was up to me, I would ask, do you have one piece of evidence that one specific provision will make Canada safer? Because it seems mostly about power and control. The US in the process of undoing many their draconian laws because 14 years has shown they&amp;#39;re not successful or cost effective, and in Canada we&amp;#39;re still pushing in the non-democratic direction. I would argue our existing laws are sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally would prefer that laws were drafted that the majority of Canadians agree with, and that are evidence based. It would be interesting to see what the Department of Justice recommendations are on Bills like C-51 to government, as I speculate even their lawyers recommend against these bills to the government and are passed anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We'd be exchanging a message maybe once a week, when out of nowhere she asked if I was free that night, in a couple hours. I was free, but was not dressed for a date, so I knew I had to race home after work to get spruced up. Because of this, I needed to choose somewhere close to my place (she didn't know where i lived) so I chose a popular little Italian restaurant in my neighbourhood. \nI raced home, got changed, met her out front of the restaurant (sans flowers, no time), and after a greeting hug, she congratulated on my brave but impressive choice on choosing a pasta heavy restaurant, when she's celiac. I'd totally forgot she was celiac in the last minute, and panicked as she told me this -- but she told me when I mentioned the place she called them, and they have an isolated part of their kitchen dedicated to gluten free options. I was an accidental hero. \n\nAfter a glass of wine, things were moving forward potentially, so we agreed to order food. The waitress explained the regular special, and the gluten free special. My date emphasized she's a celiac, and ordered the gluten free special. I ordered the regular special. I tell her I empathize with her celiac, as I was raised celiac (a long, entertaining story for a first date with a celiac), and she shares her war stories of accidentally gluten cross contamination as a child and its effect. We get the food, and although it looks obvious, she confirmed the proper bowl placement with the waitress. The waitress confirms, so we can finally relax and move on with non-health related discussions. \n\nNear the end of the meal, my date sees a 1 inch piece of spaghetti noodle at the bottom of her bowl and has a slight panic attack, as that is not the pasta her dish was made over. She calls over the waitress and says, \"Can you confirm this 1\" piece of spaghetti noodle was made on the gluten free side of the kitchen? Although I didn't eat it, even slight cross contamination could have serious affects.\" \n\nWe're all pretty sure it's a non-issue, but the waitress agrees to go confirm and we continue on our conversation, although she's clearly distracted. A few minutes later, a man comes to our table and introduces himself as the manager and asks how our meal is. My date explains how she's waiting on feedback regarding the 1\" piece of noodle at the bottom of her dish, but everything is fine other than that. \n\nHe mentions that is why he came over, it turns out there was a miscommunication with our server from the kitchen, and that neither of the special meals of the day were gluten free. My date was told she just ate a heaping bowl of gluten. This after mentioning 3 times she's celiac, and how cross contamination 10 years ago had her bed ridden. As the manager started to mention he'd comp her bill she (surprisingly politely) told him she wouldn't even have time to pay, she needed a cab right away. I walked her to her cab.\n\nEnd of story.\n\nI followed up with her, and she said although she did have a reaction, it wasn't more severe than the cross contamination one she'd had a decade before. Although she's the type to underplay things, so who knows how bad it really was. Unfortunately that chemistry wasn't there we agreed, so there was no second date. \n\n",

As an awesomite (judge, who puts $50 in the pot), you're not eligible to win or enter. \n\nIf you submit an email submission with hopes to win, I enter it into our private website, which is only accessible by the awesomites, where they will vote on all of the submissions, out of 10. It's also worth noting I remove the names and emails from submissions, to remove a small potential for recognition bias. Everyone internal can see the vote totals per entry. The top 10 scoring entries are invited to the pitch night, and they are now called \"Awesomers\". After all the pitches at the event, I tally up the votes from the Awesomites, and announce the winner in front of the crowd. \n\nAs you likely read, in this case a couple Awesomites had their heart strings pulled by the teacher story, so we all pulled out some cash and raised another $500 in about 10 minutes, and gave that to her. \n\nThere is a way to cheat the system, in that you could stack the deck with at least 1/2 the Awesomites at $50 each, with the plan to double your cash. Our plan is to never got above $50 each, as then the pot is usually under $1,000, and so it's not really worth the effort to pull off such a scam. It might also be discovered if collusion looked possible. \n\nEverything happens at the event as well, and anyone can attend/participate in any of the roles; Awesomite, Awesomer, Attendee, or Volunteer. \n\nFor example this week's event, I think most everyone, not just the Awesomites, agreed that the lighting up the sidewalk was the most awesome shit.

        "body": "As I wrote on my blog: \n\n[Losing your rights under the Mental Health Act](http://www.krisconstable.com/rights-mental-health-act/)\nBy cqwww November 27, 2013 \n\nI just read this article in Focus magazine which is the source of what nightmares are made of. Apparently in Canada, you lose your rights when being arrested under the Mental Health Act (MHA). No right to a lawyer to represent you. They also can allegedly force you to take pills/medication against your will.\n\nI can foresee a new wave of prank calls, where you can call the police on your enemy, and claim they are a close friend who just confided they have threatened suicide. If you do this at an emotionally vulnerable time, it could likely result in an episode they will never forget. All that really protects you is how interested or motivated the chain of law enforcement is to detaining you. How you conduct yourself, according to these articles, sounds immaterial.\n\nAnother concern I have, is that it suggests those who believe they are struggling with mental illness, should no longer disclose it to professionals. If a foreign government ever gets a record of it, they can ban you as the article suggests the US is now doing with Canadians.

Apparently in Canada, you lose your rights when being arrested under the Mental Health Act (MHA). No right to a lawyer to represent you. They also can allegedly force you to take pills/medication against your will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can foresee a new wave of prank calls, where you can call the police on your enemy, and claim they are a close friend who just confided they have threatened suicide. If you do this at an emotionally vulnerable time, it could likely result in an episode they will never forget. All that really protects you is how interested or motivated the chain of law enforcement is to detaining you. How you conduct yourself, according to these articles, sounds immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another concern I have, is that it suggests those who believe they are struggling with mental illness, should no longer disclose it to professionals. If a foreign government ever gets a record of it, they can ban you as the article suggests the US is now doing with Canadians. A previous disclosure to a professional can also be used to arrest you under the Mental Health Act; without any record of mental illness, this would be a lot more difficult, assuming your behaviour also doesn’t (subjectively) provoke them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a time where hospitals are in short supply, it makes one wonder how many cases there are where it consists of innocent people who’ve been arrested taking up hospital staff and beds where those in need are not getting help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having heard one of these stories first hand, I’m surprised the victim is even willing to speak about it.
