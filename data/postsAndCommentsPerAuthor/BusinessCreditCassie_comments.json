You just need enough money to pay to buy things initially.   \n\n\nThere's a couple of ways to look at it. Just like you don't go out and get a Platinum Amex when you're 18, banks don't give out Visa and MasterCard you can use anywhere without some history. Amex is an example and incidentally, Amex with no PG requires 5 million in revenue and doesn't report to the bureaus so it doesn't help you build credit.   \n\n\nSo even though you don't necessarily need some of the vendors in the beginning you establish accounts with them so they report to the bureaus. Maybe you might usually order office supplies from Amazon but you route your purchases to these other vendors for a few months to get those accounts reporting.   \n\n\nBusiness credit is custom, so in the next round you don't need to get Home Depot if you can't use it. But you can Staples and Amazon.   \n\n\nThe third round (the way I teach and thus think about it) is where you get the Visa and Mastercards you can use anywhere. It's hard not to talk about this without sounding like a braggart, but doing it this way you wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150-200k in 12 months. It's generally a 1/3 vendor credit and the rest Visa and Mastercards. The Visa and Mastercards are banks, but they are also fuel branded cards that can be used anywhere. When you get to this level banks start throwing money at you in terms of credit lines without a personal guarantee. It takes about 15-20 accounts.  \n\n\nIf you're willing to use your PG and you've got good credit you can generally get unsecured lines of credit in a matter of days. Generally better than using personal credit cards because it spares your personal score. And then it still leaves you open for other options like credit card stacking where you get a portfolio of business credit cards that require a PG but don't look at finances. Each founder could get 50-250k at 0% interest for 6-24 months. These kinds of cards generally don't report to personal unless you default.   \n\n\nI know you said you didn't want to use more personal credit cards but I wanted you to know you have options.   \n\n\nHope that's clear!

That being said, some banks are better than others.   \n\n\nI'm going to guess here at some of the most common reasons for these kinds of denials.  \n\n\n1. Dun and Bradstreet is the largest bureau and you need 3 accounts reporting to them to generate a score. Experian Smart Business is the second largest but still a fraction of D&amp;B. Equifax is smaller still and really not even generating scores right now. They've been a mess after their data breach. Then there are countless others they have may have used. Experian and Equifax can generate a negative score if they know you exist but don't have anything reporting. \n\n2.  Add this and anything amiss with your address, like you filed with the Secretary of   \nState with one address, moved, used your personal address for the IRS, can cause   \nred flags.  \n\n\nIt's really silly and also odd to find one that won't accept personal credit, especially as high as that.   \n\n\nI've got 20 lenders who would let you sign with a personal guarantee and would fund an unsecured line of credit in 48 hours. Not to brag, but to give you an example of the type of market we are in (lenders calling me weekly and asking if I have any deals) and how easy getting cash using a personal guarantee is if you're willing.   \n\n\nYou can also build credit card portfolios that require a PG but don't look at business finances. This is usually 150-250k for someone in your range. Probably not as useful but an option.   \n\n\nI've got a free guide on my website that walks you through the steps of building business credit. [It's at Business Credit Lab.](https://businesscreditlab.com) Then you can get the basics down and get a score established in case you want to try again. The irony is once your score is high enough and you have enough accounts lenders, including banks, will throw money at you.",

Experian and Equifax can generate a negative score if they know you exist but don&amp;#39;t have anything reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this and anything amiss with your address, like you filed with the Secretary of&lt;br/&gt;\nState with one address, moved, used your personal address for the IRS, can cause&lt;br/&gt;\nred flags.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really silly and also odd to find one that won&amp;#39;t accept personal credit, especially as high as that.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got 20 lenders who would let you sign with a personal guarantee and would fund an unsecured line of credit in 48 hours. Not to brag, but to give you an example of the type of market we are in (lenders calling me weekly and asking if I have any deals) and how easy getting cash using a personal guarantee is if you&amp;#39;re willing.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also build credit card portfolios that require a PG but don&amp;#39;t look at business finances. This is usually 150-250k for someone in your range. Probably not as useful but an option.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a free guide on my website that walks you through the steps of building business credit. &lt;a href=\"https://businesscreditlab.com\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s at Business Credit Lab.&lt;/a&gt; Then you can get the basics down and get a score established in case you want to try again. The irony is once your score is high enough and you have enough accounts lenders, including banks, will throw money at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

School of hard knocks. \n\nI’ve got over 300 lenders but I have a regular 30ish that are my go to. \n\nThere’s a couple of different ways to skin this cat, so to speak so I’ll address the top ones. \n\n1. For the credit card stacking where you use your personal guarantee to get a portfolio of business credit cards those have a 0% interest rate for 6-24 months and then regular rates like 13-18%. \n\nBut I never want people to be carrying balances on those type of cards after the 0% expires if we can help it. \n\n2. For credit cards without a personal guarantee and just the business signing it’s essentially the same but the rates of 0% aren’t as long. Generally 6 months to year but we are seeing better offers right now. For vendor credit/cards they seem to be around 13-15%. Some are Net 30 (especially in the early phases of building without a personal guarantee) and those can sometimes even have an early pay discount of 1%. \n\n3. Unsecured business lines and term loans fall into the same rate structures. \n\nRange from 5-20% depending on variables like industry type, revenue, state where the business is registered etc. We try to help coach people on improving these factors before they apply so they get the best rate. \n\nFor example, having 10k on deposit and no NSFs for 12 months is a helpful factor. It’s why I don’t recommend drawing accounts down to 0 if you can avoid it. Some people will 0 balance their accounts and send their tax money to another bank, etc. That can look funny. \n\nIt’s also better to apply before you’re completely desperate and still have that 10k on hand. \n\nCircling back to #1, none of that looks at business income or business finances.",

And they always want a second on your house when they are over 25k.   \n\n\nThere are a lot of easier options out there that don't require a collateral lien, especially if you have good personal credit and are willing to use your personal guarantee and a personal credit check.  \n\n\nI worked with an investment banker once who was an actual con man but he had a saying I still use to this day. \"All oars in the water until we reach the shore.\" In this context, I take it to mean pursuing all avenues until we have the success/capital we want.   \n\n\nTo that end, I would suggest a stack of different capital options.   \n\n\n1. The first thing I would suggest is looking at how much you both separately and together qualify for an unsecured business line of credit using a personal guarantee. They are based on personal credit and income and can fund in 48 hours. The amounts run from 50-300k with minimal documents. Usually a soft pull on your credit for the initial amounts. 90% of them don't report to your personal credit and won't require collateral. They don't generally look at business income either. If you don't have business income then we send you to lenders that don't require it.   \n\n\n2. Then you could turn around and do what we call credit card stacking where we help you apply for specific business credit cards requiring a personal guarantee that don't look at business income or finances. Most of them have 0% interest for 6-18 and sometimes even 24 months. Most of them don't report to your personal credit unless you default. The range here is 50-250k. I don't recommend this option if you're trying to qualify for a mortgage in the next six months. You might wind up with a bunch on inquires on your score and we can generally get them off over time but it might take a few months. If you need a mortgage I would wait on this one, but if you're living situation is stable it's some of the cheapest money you can get. If you were getting a mortgage, you could do it the day after the mortgage closes.   \n\n\n3. At the same time, I would also suggest building business credit in at least one EIN, if not separate entities and EIN's for each franchise location, without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. People tend to think of doing this either not at all or last, but the beauty of it is that you could do it alongside building the business, and when cash comes in, prioritize paying off anything personally guaranteed first and putting expenses on the business credit cards. Then if the worst happens and you have to declare bankruptcy, you could do it in just the business entities and spare your personal assets and personal credit. To give you an idea of how much credit is possible, most people in my credit building program can get 50k in the first 6 months and 150k-200k in 12 months that only the business has guaranteed per EIN. It's usually a split of 25-30% vendor credit at specific stores like Staples or Home Depot and then the rest is Visa or Mastercard you can use anywhere. It might be labeled as a fuel card but it works anywhere that accepts Visa and Mastercard and you can also extract the cash for 4-8% if you needed. So if you have multiple EIN's and entities, you can get that 150-200k for each one.   \n\n\nHope that helps and makes sense!",

        "body": "Well first off, congrats for the lean and cash-based part!  \n\n\nI'm biased because I nearly lost everything after the 2008 crash, but I think everyone should build business credit. The school of hard knocks, you could say.  \n\n\nI think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example, the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans, but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem, not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.   \n\n\nEven if you're lean or cash-based, you never know when someone is going to be looking at your credit. Unlike personal credit, anyone can pull your business and credit and they don't need your permission. So lenders, vendors, competitors, etc can all look at it whenever they want.    \n\n\nDun and Bradstreet is the oldest and largest bureau and they require 3 entries to generate a score, but Experian and Equifax can sometimes generate negative, going out of business type scores if they know about you but you don't have anything positive reporting. Anyone can see that.  \n\n\nYou also never know when you're going to need credit. Almost everyone that has ever taken a course of mine says damn, I wish I would have known about this sooner because something unexpected happened and now I needed it.   \n\n\nJust having the basics set up can be helpful.   \n\n\nGood luck!",

Those are usually a net 22 or net 30 accounts, meaning you have up until that day to pay them.   \n\n\nWhat I recommend when you're starting out is to pay those accounts just after the items ship.

Those are traditional credit type cards, but you can only use them at those stores.   \n\n\nThose cards you can use like traditional cards and run them up and pay them off.   \n\n\nTo get your scores established in the first round you need to make a minimum $30-75 purchase with the vendor to get the purchases reported.

It's really difficult to get a traditional mortgage without a personal guarantee unless you have a huge portfolio but there are all kinds of alternative lenders that will fund that sort of thing.   \n\n\nWe can often find lenders who will do short term loans of 5 years or less and that can allow you to show the income and then get into a mortgage with a personal guarantee. You can build up your portfolio and then in time work towards no personal guarantee.   \n\n\nOne thing that works really well establish an LLC/entity for each property and then build business credit in each EIN. Building business credit is really custom, so you can get cards at Home Depot and Lowes and use them to remodel, etc, and then use the cash from the Visa and Mastercard type cards to buy other properties and flip them.  \n\n\nIt depends on your market though. The high cost of living places are more difficult than low cost doing it with the cash extraction way.   \n\n\nBut having business credit cards also prevents you from running up your personal credit cards to fund a fix or flip, and then your score will be higher. You can raise or drop your personal credit score 100-150 points in one month by maxing your credit cards/paying them off.  \n\n\nBusiness credit scores are different though. They only look at how you pay your bills, not how much you use.  \n\n\nHope that helps!",

I’ve been around the merry go round on this subject so to speak. \n\nWith high risk merchant accounts your broker is everything and I’ve learned the hard way. \n\nI think Shopify Payments are backed by Stripe so it’s not surprising you got terminated twice. I also seem to recall that services are against Stripes TOS. \n\nPayPal and Stripe are what’s called aggregators. They don’t know your business or who you are. One red flag and you’re done. \n\nHave you ever had a merchant account terminated before? Any chance you’re in the MATCH database for charged off accounts?\n\n\nYou need a good broker here. It doesn’t sound like you’re high risk. The difference between a good broker and a shitty one is everything in this space. \n\nI first signed up with Soar Payments (broker).  They took me to EMS (merchant processor). They charge $120 ish a month just to have an account. They automatically renewed the account at 24 months without giving me the chance to cancel even though the broker said in writing that wasn’t the case. \n\nI could never get my limits increased with Soar. It held me up for about a year. I had approval to do one kind of business through that account. I asked for approval to do business credit and it was granted. That has a higher price point. Still couldn’t get the limits increased to match my volume. 3 months later they rescinded approval and said their merchant bank was leaving this space. Left me high and dry. \n\nThey never told me I could have another MID (account). That would have handled my volume limits too. \n\n\nI found another broker. She was ok. I got through underwriting on another account and it came back declined. They said there was an identity issue on my partner, who has a common name. They refused to look at it, despite my protests that he hadn’t had a charged off account. \n\n\nI got a new broker. She called old broker. They took another look and decided my partner didn’t have the identity issues (never found out what) and was suddenly approved. \n\nIn the meantime she took me to EMS for a second MID. Approved. $40 a month instead of $120. No cancellation fees. \n\n\nWhen you’ve got two accounts you can balance them. I use the NMI payment gateway and I can allocate whatever account I want to use. It will do it automatically but I can also set it to put the first 30k through one account or split it 40/60 or whatever. \n\nYou might only need one. If you’re truly high risk and business depends on it get two. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. \n\nI can also process Bitcoin and turn it into cash.  \n\n\nAs far as the inspection goes, it’s no big deal unless your place is a crack den. I work at home. They send out a notary that looks at your office and verifies you’re not a crack den. I’ve had it with both EMS accounts but not with the other one and it’s limit is much higher.\n\nA good broker will also negotiate on your behalf. So if it comes back with a 10% reserve and a 4 day hold, you might accept it for now and go back in 6 months and get it reduced or released. \n\n\nBe careful using Zelle or Venmo or anything like that. It’s against their TOS to use it for business purposes unless you specially have a Zelle business account. \n\nDM me if you need a broker recommendation. I’ve got a miracle worker. \n\nGood luck.",
