My experience in meeting and working with so many people in a variety of industries has shaped my perspective that we can have a government that works for everybody. \n\nThis is why my platform covers a wide variety of topics in great detail that affect our community.  There is no single issue that Kentucky faces. I feel that concrete solutions to this broad array of challenges is what we need in the leadership we elect to Congress.  This requires identifying what needs to change and implementing plans that make that change happen.

This inequality includes social issues as well as economic ones. I watched my parents struggle economically to make sure their children had opportunity through a great public school education.
