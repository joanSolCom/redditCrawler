I'd recommend you just try stuff out. It doesn't even have to be fully fledged games, you can find a game to mod, or learn some 3d art with Blender (which is free), or do something in RPG Maker. There are a lot of resources that you can try out and see how you take to it.\n\nAnd also, it took me until I was 29 to have the personal maturity to actually finish a personal project like this, so even if you don't immediately succeed, you don't have to figure everything out immediately. Give yourself a chance to try stuff out, go with what works for you. And meet people, make friends in the various communities, I'm sure there are other people your age who are thinking about making games, so maybe you could do something with that.",

I wasn&amp;#39;t great at it, but the passion was definitely there. I&amp;#39;d recommend you just try stuff out. It doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be fully fledged games, you can find a game to mod, or learn some 3d art with Blender (which is free), or do something in RPG Maker. There are a lot of resources that you can try out and see how you take to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, it took me until I was 29 to have the personal maturity to actually finish a personal project like this, so even if you don&amp;#39;t immediately succeed, you don&amp;#39;t have to figure everything out immediately. Give yourself a chance to try stuff out, go with what works for you. And meet people, make friends in the various communities, I&amp;#39;m sure there are other people your age who are thinking about making games, so maybe you could do something with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But also I hired people early on for a price, but eventually there was too much work or live realities got in the way and they left so replacing them became a lot more expensive than expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For newer games, I avoid hiring if I can, it&amp;#39;s easier to know how long things will take if it&amp;#39;s only me and it&amp;#39;s easier on the finances. I&amp;#39;ve never done crowdfunding (aside from having a patreon), I&amp;#39;ve always seen it as a huge investment of time, energy and even money, and it doesn&amp;#39;t always pay off. So right now I don&amp;#39;t feel well equiped to do a successful crowdfunding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

One big thing I did was to spend a lot of money on that project, over 80k over the course of 4 years. When you invest that much, it becomes way too costly to lose interest. I'm now doing it full time so if I don't work, I won't be able to afford rent or food. \n\nBut I think my mindset has improved in general, I've always been a hard worker but I manage to be a lot more focused nowadays than I used to be.

When I started on Arelite Core, part of my motivation was to give myself career advancement opportunities which I felt I deserved but was not getting in my regular job. One big thing I did was to spend a lot of money on that project, over 80k over the course of 4 years. When you invest that much, it becomes way too costly to lose interest. I&amp;#39;m now doing it full time so if I don&amp;#39;t work, I won&amp;#39;t be able to afford rent or food. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think my mindset has improved in general, I&amp;#39;ve always been a hard worker but I manage to be a lot more focused nowadays than I used to be. It took me a few years but I got to the right level of maturity I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Unfortunately, although I love video game music and could tell you what games most songs from the 80s and 90s come from, I don&amp;#39;t think nowadays people care all that much about music so I end up not focusing on it too much. I don&amp;#39;t think it drives sales so I can&amp;#39;t justify that cost right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Tech Support builds upon that scope management, and so will my next games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, because neither of those titles are well known, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m missing out on notoriety. Once I have a recognizable something I think it&amp;#39;ll make sense to lock down a genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Thank you for your honesty and I'll be happy to answer point by point.\n\n1. None of my games thus far have had a proper lead artist on them. Arelite Core was supposed to have one early on and that didn't pan out for multiple reasons. It's been difficult to work with people in general, a lot of them give up mid project, including people who were getting paid for it. The long hours don't agree with most of the people I've worked with sadly.\n\nTech Support definitely needs more punch and I've been working on making it more visually interesting. I'm always open to any suggestions I can implement.\n\n2. Arelite Core was originally planned at 15, but eventually after asking around, I raised to 20. Although it might deter some people, I think we live in an era where sales and bundles are the norm, and I don't plan against full priced sales so much as for discounted sales. The question is, would I have doubled my sales overall if it were 10$? Maybe, but I really doubt it, and I cut off the opportunity later on to make a permanent price reduction.\n\nI agree that it was a huge mistake not to make Astral Traveler for mobile, and it was a big internal debate about it. That being said, as far as price goes, different platforms have different expectations, and I don't think a steam user and a mobile user expect to pay the same price for the same product, partially because revenue sources are different (ads, microtransactions, etc).\n\n3. The original budget for Arelite Core was around 20k and 2 years of dev, which was based on the numbers the people I contracted gave me. Development took a lot longer because I severely underestimated how much time I would spend managing the artists I contracted, and prices went up as various people left and I had to replace them, often at a higher rate.\n\nI didn't set out to make an 85k game, but after investing tens of thousands, I felt committed to the project, especially since there's always that feeling that the end is just around the corner and that finally I have the right team to finish this. It was my first project, it was costly in more ways than one and I definitely learned a lot from it.\n\nAstral Traveler was a game we intended to only make as two people, but ended up hiring an artist to improve the look. There was a lot of internal struggle and frustration on it, it ended up costing a lot more than anticipated and it took 7 months to make instead of 3. Part of it came down to what we expected and life realities, and my partner and I no longer make games together, though we're still on amicable terms and he's the sweetest guy you'll ever meet ^_^\n\nI'm working along on Tech Support to keep costs low and have less internal struggles.. It's not a perfect game, it's improving all the time, and I'm gathering feedback as I can. I would love to change some of the visuals on it and I may do exactly that, part of it is a matter of opportunity and finding the right people.\n\nI would love to have a proper lead artist on my next project, and I'm always networking to try to find a right fit.\n\n4. You're entirely right that I didn't do as good as job as I should have tracking those numbers, and it's something I still struggle with. Right now, I'm keeping an eye on Tech Support's numbers (wishlist, mailing list), but frankly I think those numbers can be tricky, because it doesn't show people who are uninterested in your game, just those who are interested. What we're trying to do is spread the news more and reach a larger audience in general, which is difficult because media and influencers get flooded with plenty of titles. That's why I chose Tech Support, because I wanted something that stood out among the \"me too\" titles, but it's still a struggle I fight against every day.\n\n5. Tech Support as a title is subject to a lot of debate. Some people love it, some people hate it. I added Error Unknown as a subtitle after polling multiple people, but I'm still unsure of it. I just didn't have a better title and I had to start marketing it. That being said, it's tracking better than my previous games, it's making people very curious about it so I'm not sure it's so bad a choice.\n\nI think especially when it comes to Arelite Core, the market changed a lot from when I started it to when it finished. If I had launched in 2014 as planned, I think it would have gotten a much stronger reception, but expectations changed, a lot more games became available, and ultimately I got lost in the shuffle. Not to diminish my mistakes, going with XNA was a problem, makes porting much less straight forward. I also really didn't market as well and as consistantly as I should have.\n\nI don't know what to say about Astral Traveler. Wrong game, wrong time, and especially now with Steam Direct. It's another game in a more or less established genre, it should have been flashier and the end result visually isn't what we set out to do. It's what we could afford to do.\n\nTech Support is a response to that, a game in a completely different genre, trying to get people to turn their heads. Behind the scenes, I'm working with a PR firm to help get more visibility, and as for the game itself, I'm trying something very different. Again, I'm super open to any constructive criticism (something that's very difficult to get frankly) on it.\n\nOnce I'm done with Tech Support, I do want to enter a prototyping phase and exploit a bunch of ideas before I start full production. For Arelite Core, I think the combat system ended up solid but it took about 2 years before I nailed it (it has a lot of customization and strategy). For Astral Traveler, we were aiming for speed and I think we got that, but ultimately, it was a 2 man project where \"a game about speed\" meant different things so a lot was learned there about communication. For Tech Support, it started off playing a lot like Papers Please but is evolving from that because I wasn't convinced that the gameplay could support it. I loved papers please's gameplay, but I think even though that game is popular, that's not the reason why.\n\nI'm definitely learning, and I think talking with people like you who challenge my thoughts can only be enriching. Even once we're done with this conversation, I will continue to think about it and hopefully set myself up for success moving forward. I don't think I'm treating full-time development as a hobby, but rather I'm still learning a lot and making mistakes others who have evolved in a game development context might be avoiding. Hopefully, I can only move upwards from here.\n\nThank you for your well thought out comment!",

I hired a Twitter manager who helped grow my Astral Traveler account (now renamed to Tech Support), and that had a much better value in terms of click conversions. I had a contest on Gleam for free keys to Astral Traveler and ended up with 10% of entrants winning a copy, so that was a bust. Arelite Core had a publisher outside of Steam and direct sales, and Astral Traveler did not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m trying to do more now than before is just spend less time developing and more time spreading the word. I actually was not using Reddit much before, this is a good source to be known, as well as imgur. Other than that, I try to post updates on Twitter every day, and I do stream the development of my games on Twitch since mid 2016 (Patreon and donations have made a big difference in my budget). I think publishers are a potentially good thing, but most will only come through for you if you have a big winner on your hands, so they can provide additional opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; is the answer to a lot of this. Time, dedication, building your personal audience, not just for your game. Making your brand a household name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I worked on the game for years on end, then took a break to work on another game but getting back into it, it's definitely amazing to rekindle with those characters whom I've seen evolve from behind the scenes. \n\nI think it's like when we watch sequels, we want to see more of a given character, get invested in their lives. It's such a shame that JRPGs don't allow that very often, they're more interested in reusing the series name for an entirely different game. I also wish FF4-After Years was better...",

I&amp;#39;m not going to do a sales pitch or anything, but I&amp;#39;m working on some free DLC so I have to play through it quite a bit. I worked on the game for years on end, then took a break to work on another game but getting back into it, it&amp;#39;s definitely amazing to rekindle with those characters whom I&amp;#39;ve seen evolve from behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s like when we watch sequels, we want to see more of a given character, get invested in their lives. It&amp;#39;s such a shame that JRPGs don&amp;#39;t allow that very often, they&amp;#39;re more interested in reusing the series name for an entirely different game. I also wish FF4-After Years was better...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
