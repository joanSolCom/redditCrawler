We have no doubt that if these review sections are mastered by users who also continue to practice them in conversations, they will be able to reach advanced level French and be more competent in communicating with French speakers.

And we have comprehension exercises to help users become more familiar with real French conversations.

My brother and I started doing all of the vocals ourselves using Audacity and encountered many issues like listening only through the laptop when the audio needs to sound great on mobile phones too... Especially that it didn't sound the same. So we had to adjust, get rid of many clicks, saliva noises and then listen all over again through both devices. Anyway, it took us a while especially cutting all of the audio and placing it with the correct French translation.\n\n2. We focus on French only so we took a lot of time explaining the grammar thanks to my American wife who succeeded to explain it the clearest way possible for English speakers. We got really good feedback from our first users who weren’t fond of grammar in general. While learning with BaOui, you will remember the words and sentences you learn thanks to the variety of Vocabulary exercises as well as the \"Practice\" and \"Review\" sections that make you review all of what you've learned. Finally, we have a totally different App language learning design compared to the competition out there - we believe our design is truly the most intuitive.
