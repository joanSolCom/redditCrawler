And be disciplined about word count - whatever works for you: daily or weekly. Make sure you stick to it. Finish that first draft and then you have a book.\nThere were plenty of ethical dilemmas in interviewing contract killers and drug lords. They tell very self-serving stories, and you have to find that balance that understands what makes a contract killer, the conditions that formed him, but also have the distance to say he's an awful person. These are not formal, sit down interviews, no, you need to hang out with them. Some of these people are tremendously charming and when you're hanging out with them it can be easy to forget - these men and women do horrific damage.",

And be disciplined about word count - whatever works for you: daily or weekly. Make sure you stick to it. Finish that first draft and then you have a book.\nThere were plenty of ethical dilemmas in interviewing contract killers and drug lords. They tell very self-serving stories, and you have to find that balance that understands what makes a contract killer, the conditions that formed him, but also have the distance to say he&amp;#39;s an awful person. These are not formal, sit down interviews, no, you need to hang out with them. Some of these people are tremendously charming and when you&amp;#39;re hanging out with them it can be easy to forget - these men and women do horrific damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
