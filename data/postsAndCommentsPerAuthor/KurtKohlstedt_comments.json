What inspired me in part was the dust jacket of Unpleasant Design, which was a [half-band made out of actual sandpaper](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unpleasant-design-hostile-urban-architecture/).\n\nThe other thing I like about it is that the bar code (which is visually distracting) is *only* on the half-jacket, so if you ditch it or use it as a bookmark or whatever after discovering the cover guide, the book still works fine - you have the full illustration, title on the cover, etc... so no vital information is lost with the jacket!",

What inspired me in part was the dust jacket of Unpleasant Design, which was a &lt;a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unpleasant-design-hostile-urban-architecture/\"&gt;half-band made out of actual sandpaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing I like about it is that the bar code (which is visually distracting) is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on the half-jacket, so if you ditch it or use it as a bookmark or whatever after discovering the cover guide, the book still works fine - you have the full illustration, title on the cover, etc... so no vital information is lost with the jacket!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "\n\nFair question! We had about 100 illustrations to work with, so we tried to keep the focus on things that would be hard to visualize. As for the rest: if you check the bibliography for ones that include citations of 99pi episodes and articles, those will have images (e.g. a sharrow on a highway is mentioned in the book, and that's in [this article on sharrows I wrote](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/sharrows-shared-lane-markings-street-cyslists-may-hurt-help/)). There are also some things described in stories that are 'hidden' in the section-opening, full-page illustrations - love locks and cannon bollards and stretcher railings all come to mind (all in one big, detailed, in-context image).\n\nPart of the idea, too, is that for more *general* things, you'll spot them once you know to look for them, whether or not there's an illustration. So for instance there are some breakaway posts mentioned in the book, but the accompanying illustration only shows a few types - once you know to look for them, though, you'll see others out in the world!\n\nAt the end of the day, big picture, we didn't want photographs to overwhelm the text for multiple reasons - partly to have a kind of visual consistency, partly so the reader wouldn't be distracted by overly detailed images, and partly, well, an example from a classmate in grad school comes to mind: her watercolors were suggestive more than literal renderings of spaces. And what that did was leave room for the imagination. In the book, we also worried super realistic images would feel too place-specific - wanted it to feel like a guide to 'The City' not just 'some cities' ;)\n\nP.S. I wrote all that and didn't even think to mention the cost factor - we wanted to spend wisely to keep the budget (and thus price!) of the book down. I have this wonderful full-color-photograph book of vintage travel stickers, but it cost close to $100. So we tried to use funds strategically in order to make the book more accessible, too. Maybe someday we'll do more of a coffee table, full-color book for collectors, but for this, we wanted to prioritize stories!",

As for the rest: if you check the bibliography for ones that include citations of 99pi episodes and articles, those will have images (e.g. a sharrow on a highway is mentioned in the book, and that&amp;#39;s in &lt;a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/article/sharrows-shared-lane-markings-street-cyslists-may-hurt-help/\"&gt;this article on sharrows I wrote&lt;/a&gt;). There are also some things described in stories that are &amp;#39;hidden&amp;#39; in the section-opening, full-page illustrations - love locks and cannon bollards and stretcher railings all come to mind (all in one big, detailed, in-context image).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the idea, too, is that for more &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; things, you&amp;#39;ll spot them once you know to look for them, whether or not there&amp;#39;s an illustration. So for instance there are some breakaway posts mentioned in the book, but the accompanying illustration only shows a few types - once you know to look for them, though, you&amp;#39;ll see others out in the world!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, big picture, we didn&amp;#39;t want photographs to overwhelm the text for multiple reasons - partly to have a kind of visual consistency, partly so the reader wouldn&amp;#39;t be distracted by overly detailed images, and partly, well, an example from a classmate in grad school comes to mind: her watercolors were suggestive more than literal renderings of spaces. And what that did was leave room for the imagination. In the book, we also worried super realistic images would feel too place-specific - wanted it to feel like a guide to &amp;#39;The City&amp;#39; not just &amp;#39;some cities&amp;#39; ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I wrote all that and didn&amp;#39;t even think to mention the cost factor - we wanted to spend wisely to keep the budget (and thus price!) of the book down. I have this wonderful full-color-photograph book of vintage travel stickers, but it cost close to $100. So we tried to use funds strategically in order to make the book more accessible, too. Maybe someday we&amp;#39;ll do more of a coffee table, full-color book for collectors, but for this, we wanted to prioritize stories!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
