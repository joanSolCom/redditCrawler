That’s roughly 15TB of data over roughly a month of being on the ground in Fiji. Most of that photography was focused during the actual race—from the moment the conch shell sounded until the last team crossed the finish line. \n\nWe had a picture editor and digital tech in the field to manage the volume of images coming from the photographers. There was a very complex system of shuttling memory cards from the field. Many times, shuttling the cards required handing them off to locals or other production crews on boats, in cars, on horses, or in helicopters to get the memory cards back to HQ where they could be downloaded and edited. In the field, three copies of all the data were created and those three hard drives traveled home on separate planes back to the United States.\n\nI think what folks might find most interesting is that despite over 226,000 pics we shot, after you edit those down to the very best frames, there’s roughly a set of 250 pictures which really tell the story. All of that is to say, making really great powerful pictures requires a lot of time and a lot of volume and a little bit of luck :-)\n\nOne of the highlights of reviewing the photographs months later is that each of the photographers on our team shot some of the best images. And those images landed all over the place in popular media. It’s a testament to the fact that we built the right team.",
