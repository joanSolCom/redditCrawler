If you and the artist don't really have the know how of all the legal lingo usually used in those types of agreements, and none of you can afford a lawyer, I think it's alright to just state all the uses of the music you need as clearly as you can.

That would be appreciated! But I'll give you my perspective on it right here of course :) .   \n\n\n*Do you ask for a demo track?*   \nMost devs that approach us have already taken a look at our portfolio and made some kind of assesment. But it's no unusual to get a request to do a specific demo track as well.   \n\n\n*Do you just find people you like on SoundCloud, message them, and hope for the best?*  \nHonestly, if you posted here on reddit, or a place like tigSource forums, etc you might get flooded with people looking to compose for your project. So maybe it would be easier to let them find you? Put up an ad here and there where gamedev is relevant. You probably want a composer who's into and passionated about games.  If you don't have time to look through a bunch of portfolios, maybe you know people in the dev scene that have made a game, maybe you liked the soundtrack - then it could be good to ask that person for the contact info to their composer. That would be a trust-worthy recommendation!  \nThe third option is to scout through peoples portfolios on your own. Soundcloud could work, or scout on #gameaudio on twitter, reddit, linkedin etc.  You could maybe also just think of game soundtracks  you personally like, make a list of that and look up who composed for it and approach them?    \n\n\n*What ways work for you?*   \nAs the composer I always appreciate when someone who approach me has a good grasp of what I've done before, looked at my portfolio and so on, and have something in mind so that we can pick up the discussion about the game ASAP. Most people find me through recommendations or on game dev conferences :)  \n\n  \nI hope that's helpful!",

Love your username :D \nShort answer: I wanted to become a games composer since I was 8, and I went to a game design trade school to get into the industry \n\nStorytime, Long answer: \nI realized I wanted to be a games composer when I was around 8 years old and played Final Fantasy 7! I could stand still in the game for hours just listening to the music, totally mesmerized, and then I learned those tunes on my piano by ear at home. Most of the first music pieces I learned was from Final Fantasy, so that series continued to drive my musical interest further.\n\nI had that as a dream, but didn't really start to pursue it until I was around 22 years old.  I had been in bands, done lots of my own music etc, and went to a music focused upper high school (gymnasium) so I definitely stayed active with music as a hobby. In my graduation hat I have a classmate who wrote \"good luck with your games music!\", so I was definitely super into that haha! \n  \nAfter graduation I worked on different jobs for 3 years, like Burger King and such, decided I wanted to try and do something with my life that I actually enjoyed. \n \nI got into the industry through applying to a trade school for game design. I had been a game master for roleplaying games a lot, had my own little gang of gals and one guy and we played EON (a type of dungeons and dragons), and I enjoyed coming up with game ideas and what not. When I was a kid I had always liked to make my own maps in Warcraft 2, or create silly games in a game engine called Play &amp; Click (or something like that), so I thought I could give it a shot with game design. While I was there I started to tinker with sound design, as with my musical background and the new game design learnings I felt that was a natural marriage of skills. During this time I joined a metal band and met Nicklas, who also studied games but in sound design. We decided to try and make music together. \n\n6 months later I went to a game dev hang out at a local bar, and I got an introduction through Lina (on of the two making that indie game) to the developers of Hammerwatch. I called Nicklas and said \"it's time!\", we made a pitch and got the gig.  That was the first proffessional thing I did as a composer. I then got an internship as a sound designer at Rovio, stayed there for 2 years, wrote the soundtrack for Angry Birds 2.",

I read on that article that it could be tied to sleeping problems, and I&amp;#39;ve always had a hard time falling asleep, so that&amp;#39;s pretty interesting!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

One shouldn't expect a job from an interaction.

        "body": "Hey! \nGreat question!\nThe way I got in contact with this industry was through my studies in Game Design ( I went to a trade school) and go to a bunch of network events, introducing myself the best I could.\n \nMy first \"break\" was through an introduction by a friend that I had made years before, she was one of the few I dared to show my own music to back then. My second break was getting an internship at Rovio as a sound designer, and through there I got the (or rather took) the chance to compose music for the game that we were working on, which later became Angry Birds 2. \n\nOur second game as Two Feathers, was Aragami and that was a project we found through an indie-game forum. Back then it was called \"Path of Shadows\", and we thought it looked really cool and fun to work with.  If you go this route, the indie-game one, I would suggest  getting a good eye for projects. There's lots of indie games, and most will probably not be released, or it won't work out well for them. You will put a lot of time into one after all, so put up a framework for choosing which to approach. Our framework was something like 1. Do we like it? 2. Does it look good? 3. Do we think the devs will get this released? 4. Does it seem like a soundtrack we want to do? - even then, we've done some gigs that never seen the light of day. \n\nOh, just remembering back to the time when I tried to find internships at a games studio, something that was hard was getting lots of no or none-answers. But a learning from that was to not shy away from experiences that I maybe thought \"wasn't my thing\", such as mobile games was for me at the time. I first mostly applied to the big console giants of the industry, because that was what I played myself. \nIn the end, I'm not sure If I would have gotten the shot that I got at some place else or not, but opening up my horizons to other things than what I had in mind only helped. You have probably already done that with your promo works, but I thought it could help someone else to hear that maybe. It's a journey and an adventure! \n\nAnyways, you probably have a much better starting point than I did since you've already done some pro stuff for promos and commercials. \nSo if you haven't already, perhaps try and reach out to your already existing network and see if there's other work you can get there that is closer to games, or if someone knows anyone. I reach out now and to the folks I've worked with before and ask if they know someone who's looking for a composer or not. \n\nIf you want to try out some network events, maybe whenever the Covid-19 pandemic has settled down a bit, I would suggest first going on maybe a developer conference and work from there, that way you might also meet lots of people who work in audio in games.  \n\nSome technical knowledge that is important in games as well is knowing one of these middlewares: Wwise, Fmod, Fabric - so if you haven't, try and play around with that, because that will probably be an ask at some point. \n\nLet me know if I can answer anything more about this stuff! \n\nWhat kind of album are you recording? :D",

When I was a kid  I hated it, now I too love my name :D   \nHere's some thoughts your scenario:  \nI can only talk from my own experience, but minimum 3 months from initial talks, and maximum a year. When I say initial talks I mean that a soundtrack might not take 3 months to make. Depends on the size. But it's hard to jump into it immediately and not feel it out a little before rushing something. \n\nWith your example, a medium length of the song would be maybe 3 minutes.  Each minute might take about 1-2 days to compose, depending on complexity of the song and flow of the day, and then 1-2 day of production. But production usually comes later as a batch, and not inte the same time of the process as the composing, but it's good to include those days to get grip on how long time something will take to get to a finalized state. So for a final composed, recorded, mixed &amp; mastered result it could take 2-4 days per minute depending on style. Also, the first songs we compose usually is a bit more of a bottle neck, as those are the ones we try to figure things out on, then it goes easier and a bit faster when we know what to do for the game. Composers also need the chance to iterate!   \n\n\nScenario - 7 worlds, 7 pieces of music: \n\n7(worlds) X 3 minutes = 21 minutes.   \n21 minutes x 4 days = 84 days for 7 pieces of 3 minute music.  (each world has one loopable track)  \nScenario - each level of these worlds has its own 3 minute music piece:  \n7X20(levels)=  140 pieces levels.   \n140 (levels) x 3 (minutes) = 420 minutes.   \n420 minutes x 4 days = 1680 days to make 140 pieces of 3 minutes music. \n\n  \nIf this was an ask for my composing though, I would try to have a bit more in depth talk about the project before stating 1680 days to make a soundtrack haha! There's creative ways to solve things, or maybe 140 music pieces aren't needed, not everything needs to be 3 minutes, maybe not everything need to be recorded, and so on. We're also two composers, so we can split the work and do 50/50 of that soundtrack at the same time. So as an example for scenario 1:  84 days becomes 42 days for us.  \n\n\nI hope that can give some insight! and I hope my math doesn't suck lol!",
