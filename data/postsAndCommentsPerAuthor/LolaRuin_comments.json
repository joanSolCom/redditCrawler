Unfortunately, if she signed a model release then the content doesn't belong to her, but to the companies she filmed with, and sadly it's up to them whether to pull that content or not (I personally do know companies which will pull content if models ask, but legally they aren't required to). Even if they did pull them, they will be pirated and re-uploaded... because that is the cycle of PornHub. I really feel for her, and I hope that she manages to get the videos removed, but sadly I think it's only a small chance she can just delete them from the internet forever. \n\nThe way to make this better going forward would be for sex workers to be able to unionise, to demand better rights and take on unethical bosses and companies like this. Even then, I unfortunately think once you take the decision to enter the adult industry and show your face on the internet, just like anyone posting anything on the internet, you need to be on board with the fact there is no going back from it.

There is definitely a cliche about the high-powered business man who pays a Dominatrix to take control, but in reality it's a cliche because those men tend to be the only ones who can afford to see Dommes on a regular basis. The truth is submissives and fetishists come from all and every different background.
