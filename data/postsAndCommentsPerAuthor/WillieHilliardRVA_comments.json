What are your views on zoning incentives for building BMR units?\n\nRent control is one policy where economists are close to universal in their agreement that it’s a bad idea.  It causes less housing to be built in the long term and contributes to gentrification.  For anyone interested in reading about how it does this, here’s an [overview of the relevant literature by the Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/).  It does help some renters who are lucky enough to snag a rent-controlled unit, but the broader harm that it does to other renters and would-be residents of an area with rent control greatly outweighs the benefit to the people it helps.  It’s just bad policy to ensure housing affordability, and there are other ways to ensure that people can be housed regardless of income.  You raise one of them in your second question:\n\nZoning incentives to construct some BMR (Below Market Rate) housing is one area that is a promising tool to help ensure housing affordability across a range of income levels, *if implemented correctly*.  Specifically, I support a policy approach called [inclusionary upzoning](https://nhc.org/publication/inclusionary-upzoning-tying-growth-to-affordability/).  It basically works like this: developers are allowed to build denser housing (duplexes, apartments, etc.) on a given lot if they set aside a portion of the units for housing people with lower-incomes at a rate below what they could charge on the market.  \n\nIt has a few advantages.  I am opposed to the state of segregation by race and income that we too often take as a fact of life, and mixed-income developments have positive downstream effects on working- and middle-class folks’ upward economic mobility and school equity.  Another advantage over upzoning without stipulations is that voters tend to be more supportive of inclusionary upzoning, and politics is the art of the possible.  I aim to do the maximum amount of good possible if elected to the Richmond City Council, and a broad expansion of inclusionary upzoning is better than the much more limited, piecemeal upzoning the city has authorized in recent years.",

What are your views on zoning incentives for building BMR units?\n\nRent control is one policy where economists are close to universal in their agreement that it’s a bad idea.  It causes less housing to be built in the long term and contributes to gentrification.  For anyone interested in reading about how it does this, here’s an [overview of the relevant literature by the Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/).  It does help some renters who are lucky enough to snag a rent-controlled unit, but the broader harm that it does to other renters and would-be residents of an area with rent control greatly outweighs the benefit to the people it helps.  It’s just bad policy to ensure housing affordability, and there are other ways to ensure that people can be housed regardless of income.  You raise one of them in your second question:\n\nZoning incentives to construct some BMR (Below Market Rate) housing is one area that is a promising tool to help ensure housing affordability across a range of income levels, *if implemented correctly*.  Specifically, I support a policy approach called [inclusionary upzoning](https://nhc.org/publication/inclusionary-upzoning-tying-growth-to-affordability/).  It basically works like this: developers are allowed to build denser housing (duplexes, apartments, etc.) on a given lot if they set aside a portion of the units for housing people with lower-incomes at a rate below what they could charge on the market.  \n\nIt has a few advantages.  I am opposed to the state of segregation by race and income that we too often take as a fact of life, and mixed-income developments have positive downstream effects on working- and middle-class folks’ upward economic mobility and school equity.  Another advantage over upzoning without stipulations is that voters tend to be more supportive of inclusionary upzoning, and politics is the art of the possible.  I aim to do the maximum amount of good possible if elected to the Richmond City Council, and a broad expansion of inclusionary upzoning is better than the much more limited, piecemeal upzoning the city has authorized in recent years.",
