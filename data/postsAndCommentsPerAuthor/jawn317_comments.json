It's the certainty that the beauty of the flowers is fleeting that causes the sadness.\n\nBut I think forboding joy might be a bit broader.  It's both an inability to avoid focusing on the transient nature of something that brings us happiness *and* a worry that the happiness is even more transient than we think, as when we can't enjoy a happy relationship because we're fixated on its potential to end sooner than we'd like.  So, maybe a combination of mono no aware and catastrophic thinking.\n\nI'm pretty sure I heard the term in the context of a psychology course; it sounded a bit more clinical than forboding joy.",

It&amp;#39;s the certainty that the beauty of the flowers is fleeting that causes the sadness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think forboding joy might be a bit broader.  It&amp;#39;s both an inability to avoid focusing on the transient nature of something that brings us happiness &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a worry that the happiness is even more transient than we think, as when we can&amp;#39;t enjoy a happy relationship because we&amp;#39;re fixated on its potential to end sooner than we&amp;#39;d like.  So, maybe a combination of mono no aware and catastrophic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I heard the term in the context of a psychology course; it sounded a bit more clinical than forboding joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Of course not!\n\nSo, simply as a practical matter, Queensland is not going to catch any elusive child abusers this way.\n\nAs to the negative consequences, here are the two most obvious:\n\n• The only way a priest could be prosecuted under a law like this is if a child abuser were to be caught by civil authorities, and if that child abuser were to say, \"Well, I confessed this some time ago to Father Smith. Didn't he tell you?\" But Father Smith, because he is bound by the seal of confession, can neither confirm nor deny what has been purportedly said in confession. So, he would not be able to defend himself, even if the accusation is false. (There was an Alfred Hitchcock movie called \"[I Confess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Confess_(film))\" that used this latter fact as the basis for the story.)\n\n• The whole reason a person confesses a sin is because he regrets it and wants to change. But a person who is fearful of the consequences, though he might know in his heart that they are necessary, might need some convincing. By dissuading a child abuser from seeking out the sacrament of penance, it arguably makes it less likely that he will talk to someone who will persuade him to turn himself in.\n\nIn short, there is little likelihood that such a law will help bring child abusers, or the persons who shield them, to justice, and great likelihood of affronts to justice, and to religious liberty.\n\nOr, to put it in the words of English jurist Jeremy Bentham, one of the patriarchs of utilitarianism and no close friend of the Catholic Church, in his defense of the seal of confession: \"The advantage gained by the coercion gained in the shape of assistance to justice would be casual, and even rare; the mischief produced by it, constant and all-extensive.\" (Interestingly, Bentham, an agnostic, supported the priest-penitent privilege even though he opposed the attorney-client privilege.)",

        "body": "There are a bunch of really good summaries of distributism in this thread already, but I wanted to do an ELI5-style response, as simplified as possible, for people who are totally new to distributism and economics in general.  My goal is to present a summary that can be understood even by elementary-school students.\n\n# What is productive property?\n\nNormally, the way a person makes a living is by combining two things -- property and labor -- to produce something of value that somebody else wants to buy.\n\nFor instance: A baker owns a baking facility and baking equipment.  She buys ingredients and uses her own labor to make cakes, which she then sells.  A portion of the money she makes from cake sales goes to expenses related to operating the business (mortgage, upkeep of the facility and equipment, cost of ingredients).  The rest of the money is considered profit, and the baker gets to keep it all, because she owns the business.\n\nWe call the business's facility and equipment \"productive property,\" because it is used to *produce* the goods that are for sale.  For a farmer, his land and farming equipment are productive property.  In the case of a doctor, productive property might include the medical equipment she uses and the office where she sees patients.\n\n# What are socialism and capitalism?\n\nIn an economic system called socialism, the government owns most productive property.  Government-owned businesses employ workers, who supply the labor to produce the goods and services that the businesses sell.  When these businesses make money, the government gets to decide what to do with that money, because it owns the business.  The workers may earn wages for their labor, but because they don't own the business, they don't have ultimate control over how it operates or how profits are dispensed.  If the government leaders are corrupt or power-hungry, they might make bad decisions that enrich themselves at the expense of the workers.\n\nIn an economic system called capitalism, productive property is owned privately, not by the government.  Often, when someone is starting a business, they don't have the money to buy all the productive property they need to get it up and running, so they accept money (called capital) from outside investors, and in exchange the investors become part owners of the business.  Those investors receive a portion of whatever profits the business makes, and they also usually get a say in how the business is operated.  One thing they don't usually do is supply labor.  Instead, the business hires employees.  These employees are paid wages, but they don't typically share in the ownership of the business, which means they don't share in the profits or have an ultimate say in how the business is operated.\n\n# What's the problem?\n\nThe main problem with both of these economic systems, socialism and capitalism, is that ownership of productive property ends up becoming concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.\n\nUnder socialism, a small number of government leaders control the government-owned businesses and productive property, and they get to make the decisions.  If they make bad decisions, the money generated by the workers' labor gets put to bad use.\n\nUnder capitalism, a relatively small number of wealthy investors own most of the productive property, and over time, that wealth and ownership becomes even more concentrated.  As that happens, it becomes harder for people to own businesses that can compete against the big guys.  Thus, the vast majority of workers end up as employees who don't own the businesses they work for.  Instead, the profits generated by their labor serve to further enrich the wealthy investors.\n\nMany people think capitalism and socialism are the only two ways an economy can operate, or they see capitalism and socialism as two extremes on a spectrum, where some economies are mostly capitalist with a bit of socialism or mostly socialist with a bit of capitalism.\n\nBut guess what?  Capitalism and socialism are *not* the only options, nor is the capitalist-socialist spectrum an accurate way to think about the possibilities.\n\n# What is distributism?\n\nThere is a third-way economic system called distributism that is different from both capitalism and socialism.  It's not a \"middle ground\" approach that sits somewhere along the spectrum between the two.  Instead, it sits outside the spectrum, sort of like how the third point on a triangle does not rest anywhere on the line that connects the other two points.\n\nDistributism seeks to avoid the problem that occurs in both socialism and capitalism: ownership of productive property becomes concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.  **The guiding principle of distributism is that ownership of productive property should be as widespread as possible.**\n\nWhen a large percentage of people are owners, rather than just wage earners, it benefits society in many ways.  Wealth inequality (the difference between the richest and poorest people in society) goes down.  Worker exploitation goes down.  And businesses succeed because they're well-run and provide valuable goods and services, not just because they're big enough to shove everybody else out of the way.\n\n# Is this forced redistribution of wealth?\n\nIt's worth calling out that \"distributism\" can be a confusing name.  You might think that it means money should be forcibly taken from the rich and distributed to the poor, sort of like how Robin Hood operates.  But that is not what distributism advocates.\n\nRather, distributists advocate for economic policies that make it easier for people to own productive property, individually and jointly, and use that property to make a living.  For instance, distributists advocate for policies that prevent big businesses from unfairly muscling out small businesses, such as laws against anti-competitive business practices.Distributists also advocate for changes to economic policies that give wealthy investors unfair advantages over workers, such as lower taxes on income from investments than on income from labor.\n\n# What are cooperatives?\n\nOne of the biggest practical examples of distributism in action is a business structure known as a cooperative.  A cooperative is a business that is 100% owned by its members, with no outside investors.  For instance, a group of farmers or a group of website designers might form a worker's cooperative, which allows them to operate more efficiently than if they were all working separately.  Every member of the co-op has an ownership stake, which means every member gets a say in how the business is operated, and they also get a share in the business's profits.  Another example is a grocery store organized as a consumer cooperative.  In this case, it's the people who shop there who are the member-owners, and they get to vote on how the store operates and share in the store's profits, usually in the form of rebates based on how much they purchased.\n\nThere are many examples of successful cooperatives throughout the world.  In Europe, large cooperatives such as Spain's Mondragon (a worker co-op) and England's The Cooperative Group (a consumer co-op) are well known.  In the United States, all credit unions and mutual insurance companies are incorporated as cooperatives.  There are also several well-known consumer brands and stores, such as Shoprite, Land O'Lakes, ACE Hardware, and and REI, that are organized as co-ops.\n\n# Who came up with distributism?\n\nDistributism began taking shape in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a way of applying Catholic social teachings to economic issues.  Among the influential early proponents of distributism were Catholic authors G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc.\n\nAlthough distributism was inspired by Catholic teachings around social justice and worker's rights, distributism isn't an inherently religious concept.  Rather, it's a philosophy that recognizes some of the perils of capitalism and socialism and proposes economic principles that promote a free and just society -- one that puts the good of the people first, rather than being primarily influenced by the interests of Big Business or Big Government.\n\n# Can I be a distributist?\n\nDistributism has a historic connection with Catholicism.  But you don't need to be Catholic, or Christian, or believe in God, to be a proponent of distributism.\n\nTo put it another way, you can recognize the benefits of distributism as an economic philosophy regardless of your religious views.\n\nSo if the idea of distributism appeals to you, yes, you can be a distributist!",

A portion of the money she makes from cake sales goes to expenses related to operating the business (mortgage, upkeep of the facility and equipment, cost of ingredients).  The rest of the money is considered profit, and the baker gets to keep it all, because she owns the business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We call the business&amp;#39;s facility and equipment &amp;quot;productive property,&amp;quot; because it is used to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; the goods that are for sale.  For a farmer, his land and farming equipment are productive property.  In the case of a doctor, productive property might include the medical equipment she uses and the office where she sees patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What are socialism and capitalism?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an economic system called socialism, the government owns most productive property.  Government-owned businesses employ workers, who supply the labor to produce the goods and services that the businesses sell.  When these businesses make money, the government gets to decide what to do with that money, because it owns the business.  The workers may earn wages for their labor, but because they don&amp;#39;t own the business, they don&amp;#39;t have ultimate control over how it operates or how profits are dispensed.  If the government leaders are corrupt or power-hungry, they might make bad decisions that enrich themselves at the expense of the workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an economic system called capitalism, productive property is owned privately, not by the government.  Often, when someone is starting a business, they don&amp;#39;t have the money to buy all the productive property they need to get it up and running, so they accept money (called capital) from outside investors, and in exchange the investors become part owners of the business.  Those investors receive a portion of whatever profits the business makes, and they also usually get a say in how the business is operated.  One thing they don&amp;#39;t usually do is supply labor.  Instead, the business hires employees.  These employees are paid wages, but they don&amp;#39;t typically share in the ownership of the business, which means they don&amp;#39;t share in the profits or have an ultimate say in how the business is operated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#39;s the problem?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main problem with both of these economic systems, socialism and capitalism, is that ownership of productive property ends up becoming concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under socialism, a small number of government leaders control the government-owned businesses and productive property, and they get to make the decisions.  If they make bad decisions, the money generated by the workers&amp;#39; labor gets put to bad use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under capitalism, a relatively small number of wealthy investors own most of the productive property, and over time, that wealth and ownership becomes even more concentrated.  As that happens, it becomes harder for people to own businesses that can compete against the big guys.  Thus, the vast majority of workers end up as employees who don&amp;#39;t own the businesses they work for.  Instead, the profits generated by their labor serve to further enrich the wealthy investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people think capitalism and socialism are the only two ways an economy can operate, or they see capitalism and socialism as two extremes on a spectrum, where some economies are mostly capitalist with a bit of socialism or mostly socialist with a bit of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But guess what?  Capitalism and socialism are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the only options, nor is the capitalist-socialist spectrum an accurate way to think about the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What is distributism?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a third-way economic system called distributism that is different from both capitalism and socialism.  It&amp;#39;s not a &amp;quot;middle ground&amp;quot; approach that sits somewhere along the spectrum between the two.  Instead, it sits outside the spectrum, sort of like how the third point on a triangle does not rest anywhere on the line that connects the other two points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distributism seeks to avoid the problem that occurs in both socialism and capitalism: ownership of productive property becomes concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.  &lt;strong&gt;The guiding principle of distributism is that ownership of productive property should be as widespread as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a large percentage of people are owners, rather than just wage earners, it benefits society in many ways.  Wealth inequality (the difference between the richest and poorest people in society) goes down.  Worker exploitation goes down.  And businesses succeed because they&amp;#39;re well-run and provide valuable goods and services, not just because they&amp;#39;re big enough to shove everybody else out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Is this forced redistribution of wealth?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth calling out that &amp;quot;distributism&amp;quot; can be a confusing name.  You might think that it means money should be forcibly taken from the rich and distributed to the poor, sort of like how Robin Hood operates.  But that is not what distributism advocates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather, distributists advocate for economic policies that make it easier for people to own productive property, individually and jointly, and use that property to make a living.  For instance, distributists advocate for policies that prevent big businesses from unfairly muscling out small businesses, such as laws against anti-competitive business practices.Distributists also advocate for changes to economic policies that give wealthy investors unfair advantages over workers, such as lower taxes on income from investments than on income from labor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What are cooperatives?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest practical examples of distributism in action is a business structure known as a cooperative.  A cooperative is a business that is 100% owned by its members, with no outside investors.  For instance, a group of farmers or a group of website designers might form a worker&amp;#39;s cooperative, which allows them to operate more efficiently than if they were all working separately.  Every member of the co-op has an ownership stake, which means every member gets a say in how the business is operated, and they also get a share in the business&amp;#39;s profits.  Another example is a grocery store organized as a consumer cooperative.  In this case, it&amp;#39;s the people who shop there who are the member-owners, and they get to vote on how the store operates and share in the store&amp;#39;s profits, usually in the form of rebates based on how much they purchased.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of successful cooperatives throughout the world.  In Europe, large cooperatives such as Spain&amp;#39;s Mondragon (a worker co-op) and England&amp;#39;s The Cooperative Group (a consumer co-op) are well known.  In the United States, all credit unions and mutual insurance companies are incorporated as cooperatives.  There are also several well-known consumer brands and stores, such as Shoprite, Land O&amp;#39;Lakes, ACE Hardware, and and REI, that are organized as co-ops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Who came up with distributism?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distributism began taking shape in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a way of applying Catholic social teachings to economic issues.  Among the influential early proponents of distributism were Catholic authors G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although distributism was inspired by Catholic teachings around social justice and worker&amp;#39;s rights, distributism isn&amp;#39;t an inherently religious concept.  Rather, it&amp;#39;s a philosophy that recognizes some of the perils of capitalism and socialism and proposes economic principles that promote a free and just society -- one that puts the good of the people first, rather than being primarily influenced by the interests of Big Business or Big Government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Can I be a distributist?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Distributism has a historic connection with Catholicism.  But you don&amp;#39;t need to be Catholic, or Christian, or believe in God, to be a proponent of distributism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, you can recognize the benefits of distributism as an economic philosophy regardless of your religious views.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if the idea of distributism appeals to you, yes, you can be a distributist!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Here is a link describing [the decision affirming this right by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals](https://slate.com/technology/2017/07/third-circuit-affirms-the-constitutional-right-to-record-police-officers.html), whose jurisdiction includes Delaware.  And you don't need press credentials in order to exercise this right.  Everyone has this right, not just members of the press.  Here is a link to [a fact sheet from the ACLU's Delaware chapter](https://www.aclu-de.org/en/know-your-rights/if-you-are-stopped-or-detained-taking-photographs) about the First Amendment right to film police.\n\nIt is pretty clear from the video that the woman was not interfering.  She remained on the grassy area and kept her distance from anyone who was being actively arrested.  She also didn't interfere with anyone who had already been arrested and was restrained on the grass, aside from advising them to remain silent and not resist arrest.\n\nSo there was no valid reason for the police to detain/arrest her or stop her from filming.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like the only way to prevent police from doing this in the future is to make it financially painful for the department involved, so I hope the woman pursues legal action.  Because the right to film the police is considered clearly established (as a result of the appeals court decision), the officers who arrested her are not protected by qualified immunity, meaning a civil rights lawsuit can likely succeed.  It looks like [she's already filed a complaint](https://www.milfordbeacon.com/lifestyle/20200618/complaint-filed-by-nurse-in-june-9-roundup-says-dover-pd).",

You can be a distributist without necessarily having a hardlined view about subsidiarity.\n\nDistributism advocates for widespread ownership of productive property, but that doesn't mean that the ownership needs to take the form of 100% ownership of a small business.  It might instead be 5% ownership in a medium-sized business or maybe even 0.1% ownership in a large worker-owned cooperative.  The important thing is being a worker-owner, rather than a wage slave, so that the work you do enriches you and other worker-owners, rather than outside shareholders.\n\nDoes that mean that people need to take on more risk than they are currently taking on within our capitalist economic system?  Not necessarily.  There might be shifts in various types of risk, but they have the potential to balance out.  For instance, in a well-managed cooperative that has allocated sufficient reserves to get them through drier periods, there might be belt-tightening measures during a downturn, but the risk of being summarily laid off to ensure that outside shareholders continue to get their dividends will go away.\n\nOutside of the question of, \"What do millennials (and workers in general) want out of a job or business opportunity?\" we also need to consider, \"What do millennials and workers in general want out of society?\"  And we know that millennials in particular are very dissatisfied with wealth inequality and the fact that many of them are working as hard or harder than their parents did, but they're not seeing that work pay off to the same degree as their parents did.

Of course not!\n\nSo, simply as a practical matter, Queensland is not going to catch any elusive child abusers this way.\n\nAs to the negative consequences, here are the two most obvious:\n\n• The only way a priest could be prosecuted under a law like this is if a child abuser were to be caught by civil authorities, and if that child abuser were to say, \"Well, I confessed this some time ago to Father Smith. Didn't he tell you?\" But Father Smith, because he is bound by the seal of confession, can neither confirm nor deny what has been purportedly said in confession. So, he would not be able to defend himself, even if the accusation is false. (There was an Alfred Hitchcock movie called \"[I Confess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Confess_(film))\" that used this latter fact as the basis for the story.)\n\n• The whole reason a person confesses a sin is because he regrets it and wants to change. But a person who is fearful of the consequences, though he might know in his heart that they are necessary, might need some convincing. By dissuading a child abuser from seeking out the sacrament of penance, it arguably makes it less likely that he will talk to someone who will persuade him to turn himself in.\n\nIn short, there is little likelihood that such a law will help bring child abusers, or the persons who shield them, to justice, and great likelihood of affronts to justice, and to religious liberty.\n\nOr, to put it in the words of English jurist Jeremy Bentham, one of the patriarchs of utilitarianism and no close friend of the Catholic Church, in his defense of the seal of confession: \"The advantage gained by the coercion gained in the shape of assistance to justice would be casual, and even rare; the mischief produced by it, constant and all-extensive.\" (Interestingly, Bentham, an agnostic, supported the priest-penitent privilege even though he opposed the attorney-client privilege.)",

In the former case, we're asking their intercession but not treating them as divine or having any power apart from God; in the latter case, we're recognizing God as having the divine power to answer our prayers.\n\nTo us Catholics, the words \"pray to\" just mean that we address someone in heaven and does not imply we consider them as anything other than a brother or sister in Christ, albeit one who has now entered his kingdom.\n\nBut not all of our Christian brothers and sisters understand that, and when they hear us \"pray to\" the saints, it is a source of regrettable confusion.\n\nI think we, as Catholics, have the ability (and, I would argue, the obligation) to try to avoid that confusion when possible by using different language that makes it clear that we're just asking them to pray for us like we would ask a friend to pray for us.\n\nSo instead of, \"Let's pray to St. Anthony,\" we might say, \"Let's ask St. Anthony to pray for us.\"  Easy-peasy change of language, but it has the potential to reduce misunderstandings.\n\nSt. Paul said, \"I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.\"  I think this is an extension of that.

        "body": "There are a bunch of really good summaries of distributism in this thread already, but I wanted to do an ELI5-style response, as simplified as possible, for people who are totally new to distributism and economics in general.  My goal is to present a summary that can be understood even by elementary-school students.\n\n# What is productive property?\n\nNormally, the way a person makes a living is by combining two things -- property and labor -- to produce something of value that somebody else wants to buy.\n\nFor instance: A baker owns a baking facility and baking equipment.  She buys ingredients and uses her own labor to make cakes, which she then sells.  A portion of the money she makes from cake sales goes to expenses related to operating the business (mortgage, upkeep of the facility and equipment, cost of ingredients).  The rest of the money is considered profit, and the baker gets to keep it all, because she owns the business.\n\nWe call the business's facility and equipment \"productive property,\" because it is used to *produce* the goods that are for sale.  For a farmer, his land and farming equipment are productive property.  In the case of a doctor, productive property might include the medical equipment she uses and the office where she sees patients.\n\n# What are socialism and capitalism?\n\nIn an economic system called socialism, the government owns most productive property.  Government-owned businesses employ workers, who supply the labor to produce the goods and services that the businesses sell.  When these businesses make money, the government gets to decide what to do with that money, because it owns the business.  The workers may earn wages for their labor, but because they don't own the business, they don't have ultimate control over how it operates or how profits are dispensed.  If the government leaders are corrupt or power-hungry, they might make bad decisions that enrich themselves at the expense of the workers.\n\nIn an economic system called capitalism, productive property is owned privately, not by the government.  Often, when someone is starting a business, they don't have the money to buy all the productive property they need to get it up and running, so they accept money (called capital) from outside investors, and in exchange the investors become part owners of the business.  Those investors receive a portion of whatever profits the business makes, and they also usually get a say in how the business is operated.  One thing they don't usually do is supply labor.  Instead, the business hires employees.  These employees are paid wages, but they don't typically share in the ownership of the business, which means they don't share in the profits or have an ultimate say in how the business is operated.\n\n# What's the problem?\n\nThe main problem with both of these economic systems, socialism and capitalism, is that ownership of productive property ends up becoming concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.\n\nUnder socialism, a small number of government leaders control the government-owned businesses and productive property, and they get to make the decisions.  If they make bad decisions, the money generated by the workers' labor gets put to bad use.\n\nUnder capitalism, a relatively small number of wealthy investors own most of the productive property, and over time, that wealth and ownership becomes even more concentrated.  As that happens, it becomes harder for people to own businesses that can compete against the big guys.  Thus, the vast majority of workers end up as employees who don't own the businesses they work for.  Instead, the profits generated by their labor serve to further enrich the wealthy investors.\n\nMany people think capitalism and socialism are the only two ways an economy can operate, or they see capitalism and socialism as two extremes on a spectrum, where some economies are mostly capitalist with a bit of socialism or mostly socialist with a bit of capitalism.\n\nBut guess what?  Capitalism and socialism are *not* the only options, nor is the capitalist-socialist spectrum an accurate way to think about the possibilities.\n\n# What is distributism?\n\nThere is a third-way economic system called distributism that is different from both capitalism and socialism.  It's not a \"middle ground\" approach that sits somewhere along the spectrum between the two.  Instead, it sits outside the spectrum, sort of like how the third point on a triangle does not rest anywhere on the line that connects the other two points.\n\nDistributism seeks to avoid the problem that occurs in both socialism and capitalism: ownership of productive property becomes concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.  **The guiding principle of distributism is that ownership of productive property should be as widespread as possible.**\n\nWhen a large percentage of people are owners, rather than just wage earners, it benefits society in many ways.  Wealth inequality (the difference between the richest and poorest people in society) goes down.  Worker exploitation goes down.  And businesses succeed because they're well-run and provide valuable goods and services, not just because they're big enough to shove everybody else out of the way.\n\n# Is this forced redistribution of wealth?\n\nIt's worth calling out that \"distributism\" can be a confusing name.  You might think that it means money should be forcibly taken from the rich and distributed to the poor, sort of like how Robin Hood operates.  But that is not what distributism advocates.\n\nRather, distributists advocate for economic policies that make it easier for people to own productive property, individually and jointly, and use that property to make a living.  For instance, distributists advocate for policies that prevent big businesses from unfairly muscling out small businesses, such as laws against anti-competitive business practices.Distributists also advocate for changes to economic policies that give wealthy investors unfair advantages over workers, such as lower taxes on income from investments than on income from labor.\n\n# What are cooperatives?\n\nOne of the biggest practical examples of distributism in action is a business structure known as a cooperative.  A cooperative is a business that is 100% owned by its members, with no outside investors.  For instance, a group of farmers or a group of website designers might form a worker's cooperative, which allows them to operate more efficiently than if they were all working separately.  Every member of the co-op has an ownership stake, which means every member gets a say in how the business is operated, and they also get a share in the business's profits.  Another example is a grocery store organized as a consumer cooperative.  In this case, it's the people who shop there who are the member-owners, and they get to vote on how the store operates and share in the store's profits, usually in the form of rebates based on how much they purchased.\n\nThere are many examples of successful cooperatives throughout the world.  In Europe, large cooperatives such as Spain's Mondragon (a worker co-op) and England's The Cooperative Group (a consumer co-op) are well known.  In the United States, all credit unions and mutual insurance companies are incorporated as cooperatives.  There are also several well-known consumer brands and stores, such as Shoprite, Land O'Lakes, ACE Hardware, and and REI, that are organized as co-ops.\n\n# Who came up with distributism?\n\nDistributism began taking shape in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a way of applying Catholic social teachings to economic issues.  Among the influential early proponents of distributism were Catholic authors G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc.\n\nAlthough distributism was inspired by Catholic teachings around social justice and worker's rights, distributism isn't an inherently religious concept.  Rather, it's a philosophy that recognizes some of the perils of capitalism and socialism and proposes economic principles that promote a free and just society -- one that puts the good of the people first, rather than being primarily influenced by the interests of Big Business or Big Government.\n\n# Can I be a distributist?\n\nDistributism has a historic connection with Catholicism.  But you don't need to be Catholic, or Christian, or believe in God, to be a proponent of distributism.\n\nTo put it another way, you can recognize the benefits of distributism as an economic philosophy regardless of your religious views.\n\nSo if the idea of distributism appeals to you, yes, you can be a distributist!",

Here is a link to [a fact sheet from the ACLU's Delaware chapter](https://www.aclu-de.org/en/know-your-rights/if-you-are-stopped-or-detained-taking-photographs) about the First Amendment right to film police.\n\nIt is pretty clear from the video that the woman was not interfering.  She remained on the grassy area and kept her distance from anyone who was being actively arrested.  She also didn't interfere with anyone who had already been arrested and was restrained on the grass, aside from advising them to remain silent and not resist arrest.\n\nSo there was no valid reason for the police to detain/arrest her or stop her from filming.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like the only way to prevent police from doing this in the future is to make it financially painful for the department involved, so I hope the woman pursues legal action.

If the government decides to venture into a sector like small-business loans that had previously been served by private-sphere banks, could it not be argued that religious organizations, who otherwise would be getting these loans from the banks, should be able to qualify for loans when the program is operated by the government, so long as the loans are sufficiently similar to private loans and the organizations meet all necessary criteria?\n\nThen there's the point argued in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer that if the government opens a program to all organizations who meet certain qualifications, and it then excludes a religious organization that meets those qualifications simply because it is religious, that goes beyond what the separation of church and state requires.  It's sort of like if the government were to say that religious ministers couldn't qualify for Social Security benefits, or students who attend religious schools couldn't qualify for free/reduced lunch benefits.  If a government program is open to all who meet eligibility requirements, and a person or organization meets all those requirements but happens to be religious, that should not trigger a separation of church and state issue.",

Moreover, the offense is so serious that only the pope himself is considered to have the authority to absolve it.\n\nBut there is growing support in Ireland and other countries, in the wake of the clergy sex abuse scandals, for a law that would require priests to break the seal of confession in some instances. Specifically, if someone were to admit to abusing children in the confessional, the priest hearing the confession would be obliged to report the person to police.\n\nI can understand how at first glance this might sound like a reasonable proposal, because certainly any caring person would want a child abuser to face justice, or at the very least be prevented from abusing again.  But if you think about it a little more, you will realize that in practice, such a law would have no positive consequences and quite likely many far-reaching negative consequences.\n\nAs to the lack of positive consequences, think about it this way: If you have abused children, and you are trying to elude the civil consequences of your actions, and you know that confessing what you've done to a priest during confession will be reported to police ... are you really going to set foot in a confessional? Of course not!  So, simply as a practical matter, Ireland is not going to catch any elusive child abusers this way.\n\nAs to the negative consequences, here are the two most obvious:\n\n• The only way a priest could be prosecuted under a law like this is if a child abuser were to be caught by civil authorities, and if that child abuser were to say, \"Well, I confessed this some time ago to Father Smith. Didn't he tell you?\" But Father Smith, because he is bound by the seal of confession, can neither confirm nor deny what has been purportedly said in confession. So, he would not be able to defend himself, even if the accusation is false. (There was an Alfred Hitchcock movie called \"I Confess\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Confess_(film) that used this latter fact as the basis for the story.)\n\n• The whole reason a person confesses a sin is because he regrets it and wants to change. But a person who is fearful of the consequences, though he might know in his heart that they are necessary, might need some convincing. By dissuading a child abuser from seeking out the sacrament of penance, it arguably makes it less likely that he will talk to someone who will persuade him to turn himself in.\n\nIn short, there is little likelihood that such a law will help bring child abusers, or the persons who shield them, to justice, and great likelihood of affronts to justice, and to religious liberty.\n\nOr, to put it in the words of English jurist [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham), one of the patriarchs of utilitarianism and no close friend of the Catholic Church, in his defense of the seal of confession: \"The advantage gained by the coercion gained in the shape of assistance to justice would be casual, and even rare; the mischief produced by it, constant and all-extensive.\" (Interestingly, Bentham, an agnostic, supported the priest-penitent privilege even though he opposed the attorney-client privilege.)",

Lots of people (including me) would say that copyright is in need of reform.  I, for instance, think the copyright term should be much shorter than it is.\n* Is this a violation of the current copyright law?  Almost undoubtedly yes.  The Internet Archive says that it adheres to Controlled Digital Lending principles in normal times, and that's arguably legal.  But with this \"emergency library,\" the IA is buying or acquiring one copy of a book, then lending out multiple copies of it simultaneously.  It does not have the legal right to do that.  To justify its action, it says that books that the public *does* own are sitting unavailable in closed libraries.  That's unfortunate, as are other pandemic-related closures, but it doesn't mean that IA suddenly acquires the legal right to treat those locked-down books as its own and lend them out.  It's just not how the law works.\n* Does this ultimately hurt authors?  IA claims most of the books in the emergency library are older and out-of-print editions.  But I found one of my books from 2014 on the list.  It's hard to say whether people who will download these books for free would otherwise have paid for them, but I think if we're looking at general principles, it definitely erodes authors' rights.  Under the law, while my book is under copyright, I have the exclusive right to decide who gets to reproduce my creative works.  I can sell that right (e.g. to a publisher, under mutually agreeable terms) or even waive that right in certain circumstances.  If someone buys or acquires a copy of my book, they get to decide what to do with their single copy.  They can resell it, donate it, or lend it.   They don't get to make unlimited reproductions and freely distribute them, regardless if it would benefit the public to do so.  That's a call I get to make, as the copyright holder.\n\nI think it's possible to hold differing views on these three issues.  For instance, I think it's possible to think that copyright law is in need of reform, while simultaneously acknowledging that what IA is doing is plainly illegal and has the potential to erode author's rights.",

I, for instance, think the copyright term should be much shorter than it is.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is this a violation of the current copyright law?  Almost undoubtedly yes.  The Internet Archive says that it adheres to Controlled Digital Lending principles in normal times, and that&amp;#39;s arguably legal.  But with this &amp;quot;emergency library,&amp;quot; the IA is buying or acquiring one copy of a book, then lending out multiple copies of it simultaneously.  It does not have the legal right to do that.  To justify its action, it says that books that the public &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; own are sitting unavailable in closed libraries.  That&amp;#39;s unfortunate, as are other pandemic-related closures, but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that IA suddenly acquires the legal right to treat those locked-down books as its own and lend them out.  It&amp;#39;s just not how the law works.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does this ultimately hurt authors?  IA claims most of the books in the emergency library are older and out-of-print editions.  But I found one of my books from 2014 on the list.  It&amp;#39;s hard to say whether people who will download these books for free would otherwise have paid for them, but I think if we&amp;#39;re looking at general principles, it definitely erodes authors&amp;#39; rights.  Under the law, while my book is under copyright, I have the exclusive right to decide who gets to reproduce my creative works.  I can sell that right (e.g. to a publisher, under mutually agreeable terms) or even waive that right in certain circumstances.  If someone buys or acquires a copy of my book, they get to decide what to do with their single copy.  They can resell it, donate it, or lend it.   They don&amp;#39;t get to make unlimited reproductions and freely distribute them, regardless if it would benefit the public to do so.  That&amp;#39;s a call I get to make, as the copyright holder.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s possible to hold differing views on these three issues.  For instance, I think it&amp;#39;s possible to think that copyright law is in need of reform, while simultaneously acknowledging that what IA is doing is plainly illegal and has the potential to erode author&amp;#39;s rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But the trend over the past few decades is going in the other direction.  Fewer and fewer parents see their Catholic faith, or the proper catechesis of their children, as a priority.   I suspect there is going to need to be a significant, widespread change in their hearts before that happens, and I really have no idea how that is going to happen.\n\nI'm part of a dwindling parish that is about 60% Hispanic.  If it weren't for the relatively steady Hispanic membership, we'd already be closed down.  That said, most of the Hispanic families are culturally Catholic but poorly catechized, and we see a lot of them being interested in the rituals and devotions and festivals but not around during \"ordinary time.\"\n\nThere are two religious education programs offered.  One is for one hour every Wednesday night throughout the school year, where parents can drop their kids off.  The other is a Whole Family program, which is once a month.  Parents and kids attend Mass together, then the group has lunch together, then about 2 hours of instruction.\n\nThe Wednesday night program is by far the more popular program, and our DRE has mentioned that not just the majority but the vast majority of the families who send their kids to this program are not regular Massgoers.\n\nOnly about 20 families participate in the Whole Family Program.  They tend to be the regular churchgoers, but even among those families, there are some parents who display a lack of adequate catechesis.\n\nSo here's my advice for Catholic parents who are serious about their faith and serious about passing their faith on to their children:  Assume that you're in the small minority and that your parish is going to offer inadequate instruction, because too few parents are demanding adequate instruction.  Assume that you are going to have to do almost all of this instruction yourselves, and treat any assistance from your parish as a windfall.",

That's a bit much.  I see absolutely no harm in kids giving out \"Pizza My Heart\" cards to classmates.  My own kids love it -- building their mailboxes out of shoeboxes, selecting cards to give to classmates, receiving a mailbox full of cards.

Which explains why this is still on your credit report.\n\nAs to how to get out of this situation... There aren't any great options. You likely signed some paperwork acknowledging that you understood the mortgage would continue to be your obligation, but that the buyer agrees to make payments on it. The buyer pushed for this arrangement because of the time and money involved in securing their own financing. So to get them to secure their own financing, you will likely need to compensate them for the expenses involved.\n\nYou may be able to find a mortgage lender who will ignore this existing loan, with the understanding that it is being paid by someone else, but a lender who is willing to ignore this is probably doing so foolishly, because there is a real risk that you could be on the hook if the payments stop being made, or if the mortgage company from the existing loan finds out about the subject-to agreement and decides to call the loan.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Subject to&amp;quot; means the purchaser assumes ownership, subject to the existing loan. So they make payments on the loan you took out, rather than getting their own new financing. Which explains why this is still on your credit report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to how to get out of this situation... There aren&amp;#39;t any great options. You likely signed some paperwork acknowledging that you understood the mortgage would continue to be your obligation, but that the buyer agrees to make payments on it. The buyer pushed for this arrangement because of the time and money involved in securing their own financing. So to get them to secure their own financing, you will likely need to compensate them for the expenses involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be able to find a mortgage lender who will ignore this existing loan, with the understanding that it is being paid by someone else, but a lender who is willing to ignore this is probably doing so foolishly, because there is a real risk that you could be on the hook if the payments stop being made, or if the mortgage company from the existing loan finds out about the subject-to agreement and decides to call the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Of course not!\n\nSo, simply as a practical matter, the police are not going to catch any elusive criminals this way.\n\nAs to the negative consequences, here are the two most obvious:\n\n* The only way a priest could be prosecuted under a law like this is if a criminal were to be caught by civil authorities, and if that criminal were to say, \"Well, I confessed this some time ago to Father Smith. Didn't he tell you?\" But Father Smith, because he is bound by the seal of confession, can neither confirm nor deny what has been purportedly said in confession. So, he would not be able to defend himself, even if the accusation is false. (There was an Alfred Hitchcock movie called \"[I Confess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Confess_(film))\" that used this latter fact as the basis for the story.)\n* The whole reason a person confesses a sin is because he regrets it and wants to change. But a person who is fearful of the consequences, though he might know in his heart that they are appropriate or necessary, might need some convincing. By dissuading a criminal from seeking out the sacrament of penance, under the threat of mandatory reporting, it arguably makes it less likely that he will talk to someone who will persuade him to turn himself in.\n\nIn short, there is little likelihood that such a law will help bring criminals, or the persons who shield them, to justice, and great likelihood of affronts to justice and religious liberty.\n\nOr, to put it in the words of English jurist Jeremy Bentham, one of the patriarchs of utilitarianism and no close friend of the Catholic Church, in his defense of the seal of confession: \"The advantage gained by the coercion gained in the shape of assistance to justice would be casual, and even rare; the mischief produced by it, constant and all-extensive.\" (Interestingly, Bentham, an agnostic, supported the priest-penitent privilege even though he opposed the attorney-client privilege.)",

Most churches that promote tithing don't make it a condition of employment. And often tithing means 10% to a combo of church and charities.

Most churches that promote tithing don&amp;#39;t make it a condition of employment. And often tithing means 10% to a combo of church and charities. And normally there are provisions where a person is not obliged to tithe the full 10% if it would cause undue hardship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet even though this church leans toward the extreme end, courts are not going to touch this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So it would seem as if the archdiocese is taking away opportunities to engage in leisure activity on Sundays, and that's odd, because Sundays are supposed to be specially set aside for such activities (in addition to time with God and family).\n\nBut youth sporting events these days don't necessarily match the spirit of what a leisure activity is supposed to be.\n\nI don't mean that intense physical activity itself is a violation of the spirit of a day of rest.  It is totally fine to go out for a jog or a swim, or to play in the backyard with friends, or challenge a sibling to a race, or join a pick-up game at the Y, or engage in other enjoyable physical activity that allows you to  be free from the constraints and demands of the other six days of the week.\n\nWhat violates the spirit of a leisure activity is that in many cases, you can't opt out of Sunday events without opting out of youth sports entirely.  These events become obligatory.  You're no longer playing sports in your free time; the free time has vanished.  Even if you and your family consent to that and would be playing sports on Sunday whether or not you had a scheduled game that day, the fact that it \\_is\\_ mandatory is concerning.\n\nAll that said, I'm still not sure how I feel about the bishop's decision.\n\nYears ago, it was common for bishops to order that Catholic schools be closed on holy days of obligation so students could go to Mass with their families.  But it turns out that in many cases, what happened was that neither student nor parent went to Mass.\n\nI wonder if this decision might lead to similar consequences.  Perhaps the revised schedules, which eschew Sunday events, are slightly less convenient for some families, and maybe this decision will merely lead them to jump ship to other non-religiously affliated leagues.\n\nI'm not saying that the Church shouldn't take a stand on such things, but in this particular case, I wonder if an alternative approach might be: Yes, you can still have some athletic events on Sundays, but they should be treated as special opportunities to draw people closer to God.

In fact, the study found that joint decisions (at least when it comes to valuing future prizes) tend to increase a couple's tolerance for time delays compared with either of their individual responses.\n\nThe takeaway, which isn't necessarily intuitive, is that even if you know what your partner's individual preferences are and what your own individual preferences are, that may not be enough information to be able to accurately determine your joint preferences.  \n\nSo couples should have a strong preference for making joint decisions together, rather than trying to make decisions on behalf of your partner.",

Basically, you show them two containers and then repeatedly place an object into the first container, then take it back out.  Once your child becomes habituated to this, you put the object in the second container.  Babies under 12 months tend to reach into the first container, even though they've seen you put it in the second.\n\nAnd then there's an experiment from \"Experiments for Newlyweds\" that can be pretty entertaining.  Compared with most of the projects in the book, it's probably not one that you learn a lot from, in terms of relationship insights -- but it's fun to do together.  It's called \"The Floating Arm Trick,\" and it involves a parlor trick where you press your arms against a door frame, and then after a minute, you step away from the doorframe and your arms appear to float upward.  The effect is known as [Kohnstamm's phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohnstamm%27s_phenomenon), and the book explains what we know about it and how researchers are using it to learn more about how to treat movement disorders.",

None of us knew where she went. My parents called the police, and CPS tried to place the baby with the ex-husband, but he refused to have anything to do with him. At the time, I was the only one able to take in a kid, so I took custody of the baby. My husband and I eloped so he could have rights over the boy as well.\n\nFor the last 3 years, my husband and I have been raising the child. We go to all his events, spend weekends together as a family, take him every doctor's and dentists appointment: we are his parents. He knows that we are not his biological parents (he figured it out recently because my husband is black and he is white, but we would've told him anyway), but we are a family.\n\nWe have been working on adopting him, but the state has to terminate my sister and her ex's parental rights first. This has been a very slow process, especially since they couldn't find my sister, so up until now, as I understand it, we have had custody of the boy but he isn't officially legally ours.\n\nLast month, my sister showed back up at our parents' house. She's been living there for the last month. I barely talk to her because I'm angry that she left. She told me she's working on getting a job so she can take back custody of her son.\n\nMy husband and I are really upset by this, obviously. We have been trying to research similar situations but can't find anything like this. Here are our questions:\n\n1. Do we need to get a lawyer?  If so, what kind?\n2.

Even expensive private schools with low class sizes can't really compete.  And homeschooling is a _lot_ cheaper than private school.\n\n* Our faith is infused in everything we do.  Not in a pushy way, but in a way that communicates that it is a part of our lives all the time, not just for an hour on Sunday.\n\n* One of our kids has a medical condition that has a lot of food allergies associated with it.  We have to be _really_ careful.  We can make sure he stays safe at home, and at the co-op he attends (because my wife is the lunch monitor for his class), but it would be riskier in a traditional school setting.\n\n* I've gotta admit, the flexibility that homeschooling affords is pretty nice.  There is very little red tape, we can make our own schedules, etc.\n\nThose are just a few reasons, but there are others.  Hope it helps give some insight into our decision!",

Even if your child is closer to 48 months, 60 pounds is well outside the bounds of normal, healthy weight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These measurements could be indicative of a medical condition, such as a defect with the pituitary gland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your pediatrician hasn&amp;#39;t at least tried to rule out a few things, please consider asking them to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is certainly possible that your child is perfectly healthy, just really big for his age, but combined with the frequent injuries it at least raises my eyebrows, and may raise CPS&amp;#39;s as well, justifiably or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Intolerance applies only to principles, but never to persons. \n\n&gt; We must be tolerant to persons because they are human; we must be intolerant about principles because they are divine. We must be tolerant to the erring, because ignorance may have led them astray; but we must be intolerant to the error, because Truth is not our making, but God's. And hence the Church in her history, due reparation made, has always welcomed the heretic back into the treasury of her souls, but never his heresy into the treasury of her wisdom. \n\n&gt; The Church, like Our Blessed Lord, advocates charity to all persons who disagree with her by word or by violence. Even those who in the strictest sense of the term are bigots are to be treated with the utmost kindness. ",

Fulton Sheen so eloquently states:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tolerance and intolerance apply to two totally different things. Tolerance applies only to persons, but never to principles. Intolerance applies only to principles, but never to persons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We must be tolerant to persons because they are human; we must be intolerant about principles because they are divine. We must be tolerant to the erring, because ignorance may have led them astray; but we must be intolerant to the error, because Truth is not our making, but God&amp;#39;s. And hence the Church in her history, due reparation made, has always welcomed the heretic back into the treasury of her souls, but never his heresy into the treasury of her wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Church, like Our Blessed Lord, advocates charity to all persons who disagree with her by word or by violence. Even those who in the strictest sense of the term are bigots are to be treated with the utmost kindness. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

(I&amp;#39;m a white guy, and under that T-shirt I&amp;#39;m a REALLY white guy, but I complied.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lifeguard said only non-cotton rash guards are permitted. Apparently, cotton causes problems with the pool filters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether the Wilmington pool is selectively enforcing this rule, I don&amp;#39;t know, but it&amp;#39;s not a rule that was just pulled out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I sympathize with these children, because the sort of swimwear they would need to purchase to comply with both their faith and the pool regulations is expensive, and many of them are living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Here's the comment I posted on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/6du6y7/til_there_is_a_tax_that_the_german_church_imposes/):\n\nThe way you've put it in your title makes it sound as if the bishops are committing [simony](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14001a.htm) — which means the buying or selling of spiritual things.  To essentially charge people a tax for access to the sacraments, or for full participation in church life, sure seems like a \"pay to pray\" scheme, doesn't it? \n\nThat's especially bad, given that under Church law, the Catholic faithful are not to be denied access to the sacraments ([canon 843](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2T.HTM)) if they are properly disposed and not otherwise prohibited by canon law. \n\n(It bears pointing out that the Protestant Reformation began in Germany with the posting of Martin Luther's 95 Theses, and simony was pretty much the main charge. So surely if any Catholic bishops should be wary of a policy that is suggestive of simony, it should be the ones in Germany.)\n\nSo what's going on here?  Well ... more than the title would suggest. \n\nIn Germany, if you are a Catholic, or a member of a mainline Protestant denomination, or a Jew, you must pay a \"church tax\" to the government that amounts to about 8 percent of your income tax, which comes out to about 0.5 to 4 percent of your total income, depending on your tax rate. The government then dispenses that money to your religious body. So, basically, it's like compulsory tithing. \n\nThere is, however, a way to avoid paying this church tax. It's pretty straightforward, really. You just go to your local tax office and publicly declare that you have left your faith community. Catholics renounce their Catholicism, Protestants renounce their Protestantism, Jews renounce their Judaism. \n\nSo, what the bishops have decreed is that anyone who has publicly renounced their Catholicism should not be treated as in good standing with the Church. Which makes sense, right? \n\nWell ... except for the fact that the compulsory tax is a bad idea to begin with. \n\nIt's true that Catholics are required to support the material needs of the Church — it's one of the five precepts of the Church, in fact. But note that even in the Catechism, there is a qualifier: \"each according to his own ability.\" \n\nSo imagine you're a German who is struggling financially. In that case, it's likely that your tax burden would be light or nonexistent to begin with, in which case your church tax would be correspondingly small or nil. But let's say that as small as the burden might be, you are still unable to pay it and remain afloat. In that case, your moral obligation to contribute financially to the church would be removed, but you would still have a legal (tax) obligation. And so, you may be extremely tempted to loose yourself from the legal obligation. \n\nBut a consequence of loosing yourself from the legal obligation is to commit a different moral offense: denying your faith. \n\nIf the German bishops would simply let go of the church tax and rely on voluntary contributions, as we do in the U.S., this whole thing would be a non-issue. We ought to strive for a \"society in which it will be easier to be good,\" to borrow a phrase from Dorothy Day/Peter Maurin.\n\nYes, it might lead to a drop in revenue, which might lead to an inability to pay for all the good works the Church does there — schools, hospitals, relief efforts. But, in my opinion, the Church should be willing to let go of some of those things if the alternative is to cause people to abandon their faith entirely. \n\nGranted, I doubt that the tax issue alone is the primary motivator for those who have publicly renounced their Catholicism. I mean, if you're otherwise a strong, faithful Catholic, are you really going to renounce your faith for money, even if you believe that the tax policy is unjust? Nevertheless, for some portion of defectors, the tax issue may be what tips them over — and that's a terrible price to pay, made even more terrible by the scandal it causes. You think people who are already suspicious of the Church are not going to see this as simony? Get real! \n\nFrankly, I'm a little surprised that [the Vatican approved the German bishops' decree](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE88K0LX20120921?irpc=932) without making some sort of clarifying statement. \n\nWhat I would like to have seen was a statement to the effect that the Vatican approves of the portion of the decree that states that anyone who publicly renounces their Catholicism has separated themselves from the Church, and restrictions on their participation in the Church, including reception of the sacraments, can be reasonably restricted. But I would also like to have seen a note that the Vatican does not necessarily condone compulsory financial contributions to the Church, nor a policy that requires Catholics to renounce their faith to escape from these compulsory contributions.",

So when I eventually went to medical school and little Jimmy Drobkin (not my real name) became James Drobkin, M.D., it was a big deal for my town, because most people there at the time didn't even go to college.\n\nShortly after I began practicing, I was invited back to my town to give a speech about some of the work I was doing, and I'll be honest, I was a nervous mess.  I wasn't one of those people who normally suffered from stage fright, but I knew that practically everyone from the town who had seen me grow up was going to be there.\n\nSure enough, the town hall was standing room only.  I had not been eating very well that day, and I started to feel a bit of an upset stomach, but I decided to power through.  I was introduced to a great applause, walked up to the podium, and placed my notes there.  But in my nervousness, I knocked the mic off the stand and a few of my notes fell to the floor.  I bent over to pick them up, and at that worst possible moment my body betrayed me.  \n\nI let out a fart that was so loud, into a microphone that was hanging only inches from my backside, that it reverberated throughout the town hall.  Time stood still.  I felt as if Wynton Marsalis had had trumpet solos that lasted a shorter time than this gigantic fart.\n\nWhen the fart finally came to its climactic end, I panicked.  I literally ran from the podium to the emergency exit, ran outside to my car, drove 50 miles to my house, and never returned to my hometown, or spoke to any of the people who had attended, in the 20 years that followed.  It was just that embarrassing.\n\nA few months ago, I heard that one of my high-school mentors had died, and his funeral was being held in my hometown.\n\nI decided that it was silly for me to let my embarrassment persist two decades later.  Over the ensuing 20 years, I had accomplished a great deal and would not let this awful incident from my past keep me from paying my last respects to a man whom I respected so much.\n\nI drove into town the night before the funeral and went to a hotel, where I had made a reservation under an assumed name.\n\nThe young man at the front desk asked me if I had been to the town before, and I admitted that I had grown up here, but had been away from 20 years.\n\nHe asked me why it had been so long, and I told him, frankly, that there had been a very embarrassing incident, and I couldn't show my face in town again.\n\nHe said, \"Mister, can I give you a piece of advice?  A lot of times we tend to make a bigger deal out of things than other people do.  So you embarrassed yourself.  Who cares?  That was 20 years ago.  I'll bet whatever it was, people quickly moved on and forgot about it.\"\n\nI admitted that he was probably right and that it was foolish of me to have let it keep me away from my beloved hometown for so long.\n\n\"So, this incident,\" the front-desk man said.  \"Was it before or after the Drobkin fart?\"",

I&amp;#39;ll bet whatever it was, people quickly moved on and forgot about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admitted that he was probably right and that it was foolish of me to have let it keep me away from my beloved hometown for so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, this incident,&amp;quot; the front-desk man said.  &amp;quot;Was it before or after the Drobkin fart?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You might identify as straight for a time, then come out of the closet as gay.  Or you might identify as gay for a time, and then realize that although you're attracted to persons of the same sex 99% of the time, 1% of the time you're attracted to the opposite sex, and so you begin identifying as bisexual.  In that case, you likely would also _internally_ \"revise\" your sexual orientation.  Same goes for gender identity.  Although it is common for transgender people to say that they never identified with their biological sex, there are at least some transgender people who reporting undergoing both an external and an internal revision of their gender identity, e.g. \"I used to think I was a man, but as I came to better understand what it means to be a man or a woman, I became confident that I'm a woman.\"\n\nNow, let's consider religious identity, which Russell treats as changeable.\n\nAlthough no one denies that many people update their religious beliefs over time, many other people hold that their religious beliefs, or lack thereof, are _not_ a choice, because they don't express a preference, but rather affirm a perceived truth, and they do not have conscious control over their perception.  I know some people who would say that they could no more choose to reject their Catholicism than they could choose to reject their sexual orientation, because the truth of Catholicism is (to them) so apparent that they have no choice but to recognize it as true.\n\nRussell addresses this objection:\n\n&gt; What really matters is not so much that the person’s particular religious identity is chosen but that it has some relevant ideological content and is, to that extent, sensitive to criticism, reflection, discussion and debate. \n\nI don't think, however, that distinction really holds water.  It's true that religion entails propositions of truth in a way that, say, race does not.  (Unless you are willing to admit ideological claims about racial superiority or segregation.)  But sexual orientation and gender identity also entail propositions of truth and ideology.  For instance, are sexual orientation and sexual conduct inextricably linked?  If so, it changes the debate about what we must tolerate.  And is a person's gender defined by objective characteristics or their own sense of self?  Ideology certainly has something to do with how you answer that question.\n\n\n\n",

In a sense, it's been able to use the church's facilities \"rent free,\" because for a long time the bulk of the students were parishioners -- so there was no reason for the parish to essentially pay itself rent.\n\nNow, though, the school likes to act as if it is independent of the parish, and the vast majority of the students are not parishioners.\n\nSo the parish owns this considerable asset -- a facility and campus built and paid for by its members -- but nowadays it's essentially all non-parishioners who are benefiting from that asset.\n\nThere are several nearby parishes who have closed down their schools and rented out the facilities to third parties.  St. Catherine of Siena parish near Price's Corner used to have a grade school, but it was closed, and the facility is now rented out to a charter school -- which pays a decent amount of rent.\n\nSt. Anthony's has opted not to do that.  Even though the school no longer benefits its parishioners, there's no point in shutting down a thriving school.  Instead, it's opted to levy a \"stewardship assessment\" that is essentially well-below-market-rate rent.  I know that $240K sounds steep, but for a campus and facilities of that size, market-rate rent would be double or triple, maybe even quadruple.\n\nI'll be the first to say that the parish really bungled how it handled the firing of the principal, and it doesn't seem like it's done a good job of educating Padua families about the relationship between the parish and the school.  If the families properly understood all the facts, I don't think the assessment would come as much of a shock.\n\nBut it sure sounds like the actual financial plan is a win-win, at least in the short term.  It shores up the parish's finances, which ensures the church remains open, which ensures Padua remains open (because if the parish closes, its assets will likely get sold off).  And Padua gets to use the facilities and campus without having to make any significant capital expenditures _or_ pay market-rate rent.\n\nGranted, St. Anthony's, like many older urban parishes, has had declining membership for quite some time, and no amount of assessment money is going to save the parish if it can't get more people in the pews.  But the fact that it has considerable physical assets, owing to the generosity of previous parishioners, might give it the time it needs to shore up its membership.",

And by and large, it was the members of the parish who attended the school.\n\nA couple of generations ago, many parochial schools were free for parish members to attend, because most parishioners financially supported their church, and there was a large enough percentage of parishioners who sent their children to the parish's school that the parish was able to completely subsidize the school.\n\nBut the Catholic school landscape has changed considerably, even in just the past 25 years.  Many parishes have dwindled in size, and fewer parishioners are sending their children to Catholic schools, so schools have either had to shut down, consolidate, or raise tuition.  Beyond that, Catholic schools nowadays admit a much higher percentage of non-Catholics, non-practicing Catholics, and Catholics from outside the parish the school is associated with.\n\nWhat that means, broadly, is that the symbiotic relationship that parishes and their schools used to have has been strained.\n\nIn this particular case, you've got an older urban parish that used to be supported by a large Italian immigrant population.

Making the choice and the effort to faithfully enter a discernment process is indicative of sufficient reasoning capacity and lack of compulsion; completing the process should leave the couple less ignorant of the Church's teaching.\n\nSo I would think that any genuine, faithful, thorough process of discernment and accompaniment would not only _not_ lead anyone to determine that they aren't subjectively culpable for mortal sin, but, if anything, it should render them _less_ able to claim that they lack subjective culpability.",

Making the choice and the effort to faithfully enter a discernment process is indicative of sufficient reasoning capacity and lack of compulsion; completing the process should leave the couple less ignorant of the Church&amp;#39;s teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I would think that any genuine, faithful, thorough process of discernment and accompaniment would not only &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lead anyone to determine that they aren&amp;#39;t subjectively culpable for mortal sin, but, if anything, it should render them &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; able to claim that they lack subjective culpability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Okay, then you're a Christian.  You might not be in communion with the Church, but you're a Christian by virtue of your baptism.\"  It would have sidestepped the issue of Kristof's unbelief and yet still would have been an authentically Catholic answer.",

You're already part-way there.  You've obtained a civil marriage license, which (in most cases) is a prerequisite for marriage in the Catholic Church anyway.  But now you need to go the rest of the way and make the marriage valid, which requires treating it like the sacrament it is.  Fortunately, in many cases, it is a very simple process, but it recognizes that marriage is not, at its most fundamental level, merely a recognition of a couple's commitment that is conferred by the state, but a sacrament established by God.\n",

Having my family ask me why not, and having to mumble some vague answer, was extremely embarrassing.\n\nI'm now in my mid-30s and have kids of my own.  When people ask (and they rarely do, thank goodness), I just tell them I need to get to confession first, and we all go on with our lives.  I've learned not to be embarrassed about it, because the fact is the whole reason we need the Church is because of God's mercy.  I hope that the example I'm setting for my kids makes it less likely that they will feel pressured into going to communion if they're not properly disposed.\n\nA few practical tips:\n\n* A few times I told a white lie to my mom or dad and said something like, \"Oh, I ate just before Mass, so I shouldn't receive.\"  Don't do that.  Lies are convenient but usually make things worse, if only in your own heart.\n\n* \"I'd like to get to confession first\" is really all you have to say.  You don't have to explain to anybody (except your confessor) what sins you committed, or give any other details into your situation.  If family members try to pry, just kindly let them know that it's not something they need to know.\n\n* I've tried the \"hands across your chest thing\" a few times, but in my experience there are not only a lot of extraordinary ministers but also priests who don't understand what it means and try to offer you communion anyway.  So if you can, maybe try to find out ahead of time whether a particular priest understands the signal.  Or just remain seated and spend the time in prayer.  Your family might have been shocked the first time you remained seated, but they'll be less shocked in subsequent times.\n\nAnd a few tips for others:\n\n* _Please_ don't ever ask a person why they didn't go up to communion.  It's totally not your business.  There are many, many valid reasons why a person might not be able to receive communion.\n\n* _Please_ refrain from receiving communion if you're not properly disposed.  The reason this poor guy had such a hard time with it was because hardly anybody else in his church was refraining.  But my guess is that not everyone had been to confession the day before :)  Let's try to normalize the act of refraining, which is an act of true piety, so that other people don't feel pressured or excluded by not receiving.",

Your family might have been shocked the first time you remained seated, but they&amp;#39;ll be less shocked in subsequent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a few tips for others:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t ever ask a person why they didn&amp;#39;t go up to communion.  It&amp;#39;s totally not your business.  There are many, many valid reasons why a person might not be able to receive communion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt; refrain from receiving communion if you&amp;#39;re not properly disposed.  The reason this poor guy had such a hard time with it was because hardly anybody else in his church was refraining.  But my guess is that not everyone had been to confession the day before :)  Let&amp;#39;s try to normalize the act of refraining, which is an act of true piety, so that other people don&amp;#39;t feel pressured or excluded by not receiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The population size might be small, but only relatively so—probably at least a few thousand; surely not a single couple.\n\nHe also presents the theological case for monotheism and concludes:\n\n&gt;  The Catholic account of original sin, then, if not the text of Genesis 2–4, has seemed to many to require a monogenetic account of the origins of the human race.\n\nKemp's paper is about resolving this apparent contradiction.\n\nThe gist of his argument is that we can distinguish between a biological species and a theological species. \n\nIn most situations, there is no need to make that distinction. In present-day life, any person who is of the species _homo sapiens_ is automatically a human being in both the biological and theological sense. \n\nBut Kemp suggests that at the very beginning of our species, that need not have been so. There may have been creatures who were biologically _homo sapiens_, but who had not yet been endowed with the kind of soul that all humans now have. \n\nFrom among this polygenetic group, God could have chosen a man and a woman and endowed them with the first truly human souls. \n\nTo resolve the monogenism vs. polygenism problem, it is enough to say that these first \"theological humans\" are a common ancestor of the whole human race; we need not worry about whether our biological species is monogenically derived from them. \n\nNow, there are a couple of interesting implications to this idea:\n\n* One is that, for a brief time, members of the biological species _homo sapiens_ who were theologically human would have co-existed — and had sexual relations with — members of the biological species _homo sapiens_ who were biologically but not theologically human.  They did not have the type of souls that we have, and one might suppose that means they were lacking in certain faculties, namely intellectual thought.  Kemp argues that because they were biologically of the same species, this would not have been comparable to bestiality, but it nevertheless has a strange tinge to it. \n\n* It offers an explanation for the Genesis passages that describe Adam and Eve's children Cain and Seth having children of their own. Some interpretations of Genesis imply that Cain and Seth would have had to have had incestual relations with their sisters, since there would have been no other humans around except their siblings. But Kemp's explanation suggests that they simply had relations with other _homo sapiens_ who had not been endowed with human souls.  (One would assume, under this theory, that the human soul is a completely dominant trait.  In other words, if only one of your parents has a human soul, then your soul is 100% human, not 50% human.)\n\n* This theory would imply that God chose to give what Kemp calls \"truly human\" souls to Adam and Eve and not the other _homo sapiens_ that existed at the time, who nevertheless did have souls, just as all creatures do — but not \"truly human\" souls. Kemp describes these _homo sapiens_ as \"beings which are in many respects like human beings, but which lack the capacity for intellectual thought. Out of this population, God selects two and endows them with intellects by creating for them rational souls. ... Only beings with rational souls are truly human.\"  He anticipates a possible objection to this idea.  \"Would it not have been unjust of God to give Adam and Eve the gift of a rational soul, a gift which would make them fully human (and immortal), with the additional prospect of eternal happiness with God in Heaven, while leaving in an animal state their siblings and cousins, who also had a bodily constitution sufficient to sustain rational activity? I think not. A theology in which the existence of a Chosen People is a central theme in salvation history can surely accommodate the existence of a Chosen Couple. God did not owe Adam and Eve's cousins a rational and therefore immortal soul. The hominization of Adam and Eve was a free gift.\" Or, to put it another way, it is no more unjust of God to have deprived these hominid cousins of a \"truly human\" soul than for him to deprive a homo erectus or a homo australopithecus or even an ape of the same. Does the ape suffer as a result? No, because it can't even comprehend what it lacks.\n\nI, personally, am not completely convinced that Kemp's theory is the best way for the Church to confront the problem of monotheism vs. polytheism.  But it certainly presents the problem well and gives you a lot to think about.",

This practice has led to the court holding far too much power, and I think people on both the left and the right should be concerned about it.

        "body": "The way you've put it in your title makes it sound as if the bishops are committing [simony](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14001a.htm) — which means the buying or selling of spiritual things.  To essentially charge people a tax for access to the sacraments, or for full participation in church life, sure seems like a \"pay to pray\" scheme, doesn't it? \n\nThat's especially bad, given that under Church law, the Catholic faithful are not to be denied access to the sacraments ([canon 843](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2T.HTM)) if they are properly disposed and not otherwise prohibited by canon law. \n\n(It bears pointing out that the Protestant Reformation began in Germany with the posting of Martin Luther's 95 Theses, and simony was pretty much the main charge. So surely if any Catholic bishops should be wary of a policy that is suggestive of simony, it should be the ones in Germany.)\n\nSo what's going on here?  Well ... more than the title would suggest. \n\nIn Germany, if you are a Catholic, or a member of a mainline Protestant denomination, or a Jew, you must pay a \"church tax\" to the government that amounts to about 8 percent of your income tax, which comes out to about 0.5 to 4 percent of your total income, depending on your tax rate. The government then dispenses that money to your religious body. So, basically, it's like compulsory tithing. \n\nThere is, however, a way to avoid paying this church tax. It's pretty straightforward, really. You just go to your local tax office and publicly declare that you have left your faith community. Catholics renounce their Catholicism, Protestants renounce their Protestantism, Jews renounce their Judaism. \n\nSo, what the bishops have decreed is that anyone who has publicly renounced their Catholicism should not be treated as in good standing with the Church. Which makes sense, right? \n\nWell ... except for the fact that the compulsory tax is a bad idea to begin with. \n\nIt's true that Catholics are required to support the material needs of the Church — it's one of the five precepts of the Church, in fact. But note that even in the Catechism, there is a qualifier: \"each according to his own ability.\" \n\nSo imagine you're a German who is struggling financially. In that case, it's likely that your tax burden would be light or nonexistent to begin with, in which case your church tax would be correspondingly small or nil. But let's say that as small as the burden might be, you are still unable to pay it and remain afloat. In that case, your moral obligation to contribute financially to the church would be removed, but you would still have a legal (tax) obligation. And so, you may be extremely tempted to loose yourself from the legal obligation. \n\nBut a consequence of loosing yourself from the legal obligation is to commit a different moral offense: denying your faith. \n\nIf the German bishops would simply let go of the church tax and rely on voluntary contributions, as we do in the U.S., this whole thing would be a non-issue. We ought to strive for a \"society in which it will be easier to be good,\" to borrow a phrase from Dorothy Day/Peter Maurin.\n\nYes, it might lead to a drop in revenue, which might lead to an inability to pay for all the good works the Church does there — schools, hospitals, relief efforts. But, in my opinion, the Church should be willing to let go of some of those things if the alternative is to cause people to abandon their faith entirely. \n\nGranted, I doubt that the tax issue alone is the primary motivator for those who have publicly renounced their Catholicism. I mean, if you're otherwise a strong, faithful Catholic, are you really going to renounce your faith for money, even if you believe that the tax policy is unjust? Nevertheless, for some portion of defectors, the tax issue may be what tips them over — and that's a terrible price to pay, made even more terrible by the scandal it causes. You think people who are already suspicious of the Church are not going to see this as simony? Get real! \n\nFrankly, I'm a little surprised that [the Vatican approved the German bishops' decree](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE88K0LX20120921?irpc=932) without making some sort of clarifying statement. \n\nWhat I would like to have seen was a statement to the effect that the Vatican approves of the portion of the decree that states that anyone who publicly renounces their Catholicism has separated themselves from the Church, and restrictions on their participation in the Church, including reception of the sacraments, can be reasonably restricted. But I would also like to have seen a note that the Vatican does not necessarily condone compulsory financial contributions to the Church, nor a policy that requires Catholics to renounce their faith to escape from these compulsory contributions.",

To essentially charge people a tax for access to the sacraments, or for full participation in church life, sure seems like a &amp;quot;pay to pray&amp;quot; scheme, doesn&amp;#39;t it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s especially bad, given that under Church law, the Catholic faithful are not to be denied access to the sacraments (&lt;a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2T.HTM\"&gt;canon 843&lt;/a&gt;) if they are properly disposed and not otherwise prohibited by canon law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(It bears pointing out that the Protestant Reformation began in Germany with the posting of Martin Luther&amp;#39;s 95 Theses, and simony was pretty much the main charge. So surely if any Catholic bishops should be wary of a policy that is suggestive of simony, it should be the ones in Germany.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s going on here?  Well ... more than the title would suggest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Germany, if you are a Catholic, or a member of a mainline Protestant denomination, or a Jew, you must pay a &amp;quot;church tax&amp;quot; to the government that amounts to about 8 percent of your income tax, which comes out to about 0.5 to 4 percent of your total income, depending on your tax rate. The government then dispenses that money to your religious body. So, basically, it&amp;#39;s like compulsory tithing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a way to avoid paying this church tax. It&amp;#39;s pretty straightforward, really. You just go to your local tax office and publicly declare that you have left your faith community. Catholics renounce their Catholicism, Protestants renounce their Protestantism, Jews renounce their Judaism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what the bishops have decreed is that anyone who has publicly renounced their Catholicism should not be treated as in good standing with the Church. Which makes sense, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well ... except for the fact that the compulsory tax is a bad idea to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that Catholics are required to support the material needs of the Church — it&amp;#39;s one of the five precepts of the Church, in fact. But note that even in the Catechism, there is a qualifier: &amp;quot;each according to his own ability.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So imagine you&amp;#39;re a German who is struggling financially. In that case, it&amp;#39;s likely that your tax burden would be light or nonexistent to begin with, in which case your church tax would be correspondingly small or nil. But let&amp;#39;s say that as small as the burden might be, you are still unable to pay it and remain afloat. In that case, your moral obligation to contribute financially to the church would be removed, but you would still have a legal (tax) obligation. And so, you may be extremely tempted to loose yourself from the legal obligation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a consequence of loosing yourself from the legal obligation is to commit a different moral offense: denying your faith. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the German bishops would simply let go of the church tax and rely on voluntary contributions, as we do in the U.S., this whole thing would be a non-issue. We ought to strive for a &amp;quot;society in which it will be easier to be good,&amp;quot; to borrow a phrase from Dorothy Day/Peter Maurin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it might lead to a drop in revenue, which might lead to an inability to pay for all the good works the Church does there — schools, hospitals, relief efforts. But, in my opinion, the Church should be willing to let go of some of those things if the alternative is to cause people to abandon their faith entirely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, I doubt that the tax issue alone is the primary motivator for those who have publicly renounced their Catholicism. I mean, if you&amp;#39;re otherwise a strong, faithful Catholic, are you really going to renounce your faith for money, even if you believe that the tax policy is unjust? Nevertheless, for some portion of defectors, the tax issue may be what tips them over — and that&amp;#39;s a terrible price to pay, made even more terrible by the scandal it causes. You think people who are already suspicious of the Church are not going to see this as simony? Get real! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I&amp;#39;m a little surprised that &lt;a href=\"http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE88K0LX20120921?irpc=932\"&gt;the Vatican approved the German bishops&amp;#39; decree&lt;/a&gt; without making some sort of clarifying statement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I would like to have seen was a statement to the effect that the Vatican approves of the portion of the decree that states that anyone who publicly renounces their Catholicism has separated themselves from the Church, and restrictions on their participation in the Church, including reception of the sacraments, can be reasonably restricted. But I would also like to have seen a note that the Vatican does not necessarily condone compulsory financial contributions to the Church, nor a policy that requires Catholics to renounce their faith to escape from these compulsory contributions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The new definition is worded in such a way that very few signs would qualify as political signs.\n\nAccording to the revised definition, a political sign is a temporary sign erected within 90 days of an election and removed within 14 days after the election.  That's the definition.  IANAL, but I would think a court would conclude that if a sign is not temporary, or is not erected within 90 days of an election, or is not removed within 14 days after an election, it does not meet the ordinance's definition of a political sign.\n\nIn other words, instead of broadening the definition of a political sign (which was the ostensible purpose of the revised ordinance), the actual wording the town adopted instead greatly narrows the definition.\n\nThat's in direct contrast to what the Milton town attorney argued in his letter to resident Penny Nickerson.  He said that the revised ordinance broadened what the town considers to be a political sign by removing the phrase \"intended to advance a political statement, cause, or candidate\" from the definition.  (The removal of that phrase was possibly in response to the recent Supreme Court case [Reed v. Town of Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_v._Town_of_Gilbert), which ruled that a local government cannot set different rules for different signs, depending on the nature of their content.) But absent any other qualifiers in the revised definition, the removal of that phrase essentially treats _all_ signs as political signs, and if the \"erected 90 days before an election / removed within 14 days after\" language had not been removed from Section 220-63G, it would mean that any signs posted outside of election season, regardless of their content, are code violations.\n\nThere _are_, however, other qualifiers -- namely, the signs have to be temporary, and they have to be erected and removed during a specific time frame, to meet the definition of a political sign.  \n\nAnd so, regardless of the constitutionality of sign ordinances in general, Milton's ordinance, as written, does not appear to support the code violations Nickerson was cited with.  In fact, I would think any code violations for signs erected outside of election season could be challenged on those grounds.",

Furthermore, the cry/fuss duration may depend on the patterns of feeding (breast vs bottle).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These differences likely explain all of the variations in crying frequency across countries.  In other words, it&amp;#39;s pretty unlikely that there&amp;#39;s anything innate about Britain, Canada, or Italy (e.g. the climate) that make babies there cry more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It made financial sense for them to do so.  But it seems like they should have disclosed at some point prior to settlement that the contract existed, because now they're in the unfortunate position where we own and control the equipment, but they're the ones on the hook to fulfill the terms of the contract, because it was never assigned to us.\n\nSo, no, the previous homeowner cannot come and take the equipment.  We bought it from them when we purchased the house.  But we did not agree, as part of that purchase, to assume the remainder of their contract for the SRECs, because we had no idea the contract existed.\n\nAgain, I'm not suggesting that their failing to disclose the contract was done deliberately.  They may not have forgotten about it, or not realized that the contract and its obligations didn't automatically transfer to the new homeowners.\n\nBut it's potentially a very costly problem for them if we don't offer to assume the remainder of the contract, and an unexpected, un-negotiated obligation for us if we do.

        "body": "Catholic here.\n\nI remember first hearing about this when I read a Slate article about it a few years ago (\"[Jesus Wept](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/new_scientist/2012/07/a_statue_of_jesus_oozing_holy_water_an_indian_skeptic_debunks_miracle.html)\").\n\nThe Slate article is actually a Q&amp;A with the skeptic. Here's the background: \n\n&gt; Sanal Edamaruku faces a Catholic backlash after insisting that the \"holy\" water dripping from a statue of Christ in Mumbai, India, came from a leaky drain. Edamaruku is the founder and president of Rationalist International, president of the Indian Rationalist Association, and honorary associate of the U.K. Rationalist Association.\n\nIn the interview, Edamaruku says that he was given permission by Church authorities to investigate a dripping statue, and he determined that there was no supernatural cause for the phenomenon. Instead, it appears that the water was from a leaky drain. \n\nHe then says that after announcing his findings, leaders of two Catholic organizations filed charges against him under an Indian law that prohibits \"deliberately hurting religious feelings and attempting malicious acts intended to outrage the religious sentiments of any class or community.\" \n\nEdamaruku says, with regard to the accusations, \"It is absurd to claim that I did anything of the sort.\" \n\nHe then has this to say about religious faith in general: \n\n\"The promotion of superstition and belief in paranormal phenomena dulls people's minds and establishes dangerous misconceptions about reality in our society. Such efforts have to be countered. ... For many, the regressive belief in superstitions and miracles is an escape from the hardships of life. Once trapped into irrationalism, they become more incapable of mastering reality.\" \n\nNow, I was a bit taken aback by the idea that there would be Catholic organizations who would take umbrage at his finding. \n\nCatholicism is not only open to having purported miracles investigated; it's, in fact, a requirement. Every year, many such investigations are conducted, and the vast majority find that nothing miraculous has occurred. The Church is fine with that; it's just as happy to weed out \"imposters\" as anyone else. \n\nFor instance, [here's a story](http://www.startribune.com/local/blogs/135600233.html) about a U.S. archdiocese declaring a \"bleeding\" consecrated host to be nonmiraculous. \n\nAnd here's the quote that sums up the Church's position: \"While the Catholic Church fully recognizes the possibility of miracles and remains open to their possibility, it does so with extreme scrutiny, investigation and care. This incident was the result of natural biological causes and should not be considered in any other way.\" \n\nSo I was surprised that some in the the Catholic community in Mumbai were resistant to Edamaruku's finding.\n\nBut I should have guessed. There is more to the story than Edamaruku's account would suggest. \n\nAfter a TV special aired in which Edamaruku presented his findings, a bishop of the Mumbai archdiocese issued this statement: \n\n&gt; STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE IRLA CROSS -- in the light of the TV Programme on the \"Dripping Cross\" \n\n&gt; A general Observation: The official Church is slow to attribute supernatural causes to \"extra-ordinary\" phenomena we observe in life. As far as possible, the Church tries to see if such phenomena can be explained by natural causes. Further, the Church does not pay too much attention to these extraordinary phenomena, even though she accepts the possibility that God may intervene in human life in an extraordinary way -- what we often term a \"miraculous\" way. \n\n&gt; Coming to the \"dripping Cross\" at Irla: One can doubt if this water dripping has a supernatural cause. The Church has NOT made any pronouncement on it. There is a lengthy scientific process that has to be undergone before any official pronouncement is made. It is quite possible that the dripping water may have a natural explanation. \n\n&gt; What is surely objectionable are the statements made by the Delhi interlocutor, Mr. Sanal. We point out some of these erroneous assertions: \n\n&gt; Contrary to the interlocutor's claim, the Church does not advocate the worship of images. There is a difference between honouring a thing and making it divine, something to be worshipped. We respect and honour the Scriptures of any religion not because the books are in themselves divine, but because they have a special significance for the adherents of that religion. We honour a cross because it is for us a reminder of the love of Jesus who died for us. \n\n&gt; A second gratuitous assertion is that the dripping Cross has been created by priests who are out to make money! This Cross is not on Church property, and the one who is alleged to have noticed the dripping water was not even a Catholic. To the best of our knowledge, no money has been collected by any priest. And surely, priests do not build churches with such money, as is claimed by the interlocutor. \n\n&gt; A third unwarranted statement is that the Pope or the Church is against Science. The interlocutor would only have to go to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia on the internet, to see the list of eminent Catholic scientists and how the Church has supported scientific research since the emergence of the European universities in the Middle Ages. There is a Pontifical Academy of Sciences, founded in 1603, which seeks to pay honour to pure science, wherever it is found, to assure its freedom and to promote its research. \n\n&gt; I realize that the interlocutor has made these and other unwarranted statements out of ignorance — he is unaware of facts. The least he could do would be to apologize to the Catholic community for hurting it, even though it might be inadvertently. \n\n&gt; + Bishop Agnelo Gracias Auxiliary Bishop of Bombay\n\nSo, basically, the Catholics in Mumbai who were upset with Edamaruku were not upset with him, as he contends, because he found that the dripping cross has a natural explanation. \n\nRather, they were upset with him because he alleged — apparently without offering any proof — that it was all a scam set up by Catholic priests to bilk people of their money. \n\nNow, you can debate the wisdom of India's law prohibiting speech that offends religious sentiments. Obviously, such an idea is quite foreign to us here in the U.S. — although it should be noted that religious clashes are common, and sometimes turn violent and even deadly, in parts of India, which gives a little context to the law.

Advertising revenue has taken a 20-year dive.  Newspapers have had to lay off great journalists, reduce coverage, overwork the writers and editors who managed to avoid getting axed, pay low wages that don't attract (or force out) great talent, and so on.

Basically, you have people commit to buying a subscription, but only if a high enough threshold of other people also commit.  Then it becomes a win-win.  If the campaign reaches its threshold, then everyone involved can feel pretty confident that it generates enough revenue to bump up the quality (assuming the newspaper is actually committed to doing that).

No wonder they had to buy out of state!\n\n(I'm guessing OP mistakenly tacked on a zero and the doc fee is actually $700, which would put the book value at a more realistic $16,500.)\n\nBy the way, I once bought a car from a UD student in what I assumed was a private party sale.  Turns out, he was registered as a dealer in NY and was trying to sell it as a dealer.  Totally illegal to do that if the transaction occurs in DE.  I only found out when I took the car to the DMV and they told me the guy who sold me the car wasn't the guy listed on the title, so they couldn't register it.  The dealer guy got spooked when I told him I was going to the attorney general's office and refunded my money.\n\nLesson I learned: Title issues are no joke.

No wonder they had to buy out of state!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m guessing OP mistakenly tacked on a zero and the doc fee is actually $700, which would put the book value at a more realistic $16,500.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, I once bought a car from a UD student in what I assumed was a private party sale.  Turns out, he was registered as a dealer in NY and was trying to sell it as a dealer.  Totally illegal to do that if the transaction occurs in DE.  I only found out when I took the car to the DMV and they told me the guy who sold me the car wasn&amp;#39;t the guy listed on the title, so they couldn&amp;#39;t register it.  The dealer guy got spooked when I told him I was going to the attorney general&amp;#39;s office and refunded my money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lesson I learned: Title issues are no joke.  Make sure everything&amp;#39;s on the level, because otherwise you could be on the hook for a car that you can&amp;#39;t actually legally drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In many cases, the entire reason it was given to the Vatican was because it was understood that the Vatican would not sell it, but would maintain it in perpetuity and make it accessible to the public.\n\nBeyond that, a lot of the priceless art is totally illiquid.  It's not like it's practical for the Sistine Chapel to end up in the hands of a private buyer, even if it were for sale.\n\nAnd as this [Catholic Answers](http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/is-there-a-concise-way-to-respond-to-criticisms-of-the-churchs-wealth) post points out, outside of that priceless art and the actual buildings that make up the Vatican, there isn't much wealth.  Its annual operating budget is relatively small.  Even so, the Church remains one of the largest charitable organizations in the world.",

In many cases, the entire reason it was given to the Vatican was because it was understood that the Vatican would not sell it, but would maintain it in perpetuity and make it accessible to the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, a lot of the priceless art is totally illiquid.  It&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s practical for the Sistine Chapel to end up in the hands of a private buyer, even if it were for sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as this &lt;a href=\"http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/is-there-a-concise-way-to-respond-to-criticisms-of-the-churchs-wealth\"&gt;Catholic Answers&lt;/a&gt; post points out, outside of that priceless art and the actual buildings that make up the Vatican, there isn&amp;#39;t much wealth.  Its annual operating budget is relatively small.  Even so, the Church remains one of the largest charitable organizations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Yet even though the story may be told in a non-literal way, the Church asserts that it nevertheless describes a real event. \n\nSo, maybe there wasn't a literal talking snake, or a literal tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and maybe Adam wasn't literally fashioned out of clay. \n\nBut the Church asserts that there was a first man, who committed a first sin, and that his original sin was propagated to every other man who has ever lived. \n\nThis poses a problem, however, because current science suggests that our species, homo sapiens, arose from an original population of tens of thousands (polygenism), not from an original population of two (monogenism). \n\nYou can read more about the Church's official position on polygenism in Pope Pius XII's 150 encyclical [_Humani Generis_](http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis.html) (\"On the Origin of Human Life\"), but here's the most pertinent passage:\n\n&gt; When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents. Now it is in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled with that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church propose with regard to original sin, which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam and which, through generation, is passed on to all and is in everyone as his own.\n\nNow, if you think about it, this puts Catholics — even thought they can accept many aspects of evolutionary theory — in kind of the same boat as Ken Ham and other young-earth creationists.\n\nWe recognize the Bible as inerrant; the Bible appears to demand monogenism; and yet science suggests otherwise. At first glance, it looks like we're faced with having to either reject the Bible or reject science, neither of which many Catholics are wont to do. \n\nThere have been various efforts to try to reconcile the scientific evidence with the Church's insistence on monogenesis.\n\nThe most interesting (but perhaps not the most convincing) attempt at confronting this problem that I've seen is by Kenneth Kemp, a Catholic philosophy professor who [in this essay](http://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/papers/kemp-monogenism.pdf) argues for a distinction between biological and theological species.",

You can find an explanation about the difference between the two certifications &lt;a href=\"http://mana.org/about-midwives/what-is-a-midwife\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re correct that there are more licensed midwives in Delaware than are listed on the website, but the website is not inaccurate, so long as it only claims to list CPMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I&amp;#39;m related to one of the CPMs on the list, and my wife and I have received care from several of the CNMs at the Birth Center.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It's very common in [emotionally abusive relationships](http://liveboldandbloom.com/11/relationships/signs-of-emotional-abuse) for the abuser to be controlling, to isolate their partner from family and friends, to demand their partner give up things they enjoy, and to threaten to end the relationship if they don't get what they want (which can be especially devastating if you have no support system).\n\nWorth noting, from the article I linked above:\n\n&gt; The victim of the abuse quite **often doesn’t see the mistreatment as abusive**. They develop coping mechanisms of denial and minimizing in order to deal with the stress. But the effects of long-term emotional abuse can cause severe emotional trauma in the victim, including depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder.\n\nIt sounds like you are deeply in love with him (you'd have to be to do all the things you've done for the sake of the relationship) and have taken pains to defend him (\"He only wants the best for a baby,\" \"This showed me that he actually does want to be with me\"), but I hope you will think long and hard about how these things you've described fit the pattern of emotional abuse. \n\nAside from that ... are you two married? Has marriage been discussed? I ask for several reasons. One is that it's indicative of a genuine commitment. The other is that marriage prep can help you determine how to handle conflicts, and can also help you realize when it's not going to work out *before* you commit to marriage or raising a child together.

I ask because if he's commitment-phobic about your relationship, that probably tells you something about how he feels about the lasting commitment that having a child together entails.\n\nYou say this is the first serious relationship for either of you.  Could it be the case that because it's your first serious relationship, you're both in your mid-30s, and you're already concerned about how much longer you'll be able to conceive, it could be clouding your judgment about whether to \"cut your losses\"?\n\nHave the two of you ever done any sort of relationship counseling?  Would he be open to it?  (If not, another red flag.)  Before I got married, my wife and I attended a marriage-prep retreat, and it was *really* helpful.

My hope is that they will see that you have approached them with maturity and will be pleased that you are doing your best to prepare for the baby. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are only nominally Catholic, my advice is largely the same. But I would caution you to avoid doing a Catholic wedding just to please your parents, or rushing the wedding for the same reason. And my guess is that any priest you approach would say the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

They're all adapted from published academic research and are meant to help you better understand what an amazing little creature she is.\n\nSecond recommendation: Toys.  My wife and I are expecting a girl in December, so we've been checking this stuff out, too.  In fact, we were in Toys R Us today, and I noticed that they have a decent science section, and -- woohoo! -- very few of the science activity kits seem targeted toward one gender or the other.  Most of those are for older kids, though.  Then again, when she's a baby and toddler, pretty much any toy is a science toy for her, since she's learning about everything!  Also, Duplo/Legos are a great toy for both boys and girls.  Some of it is gender-targeted, but a lot isn't.\n\nThird ... books.  I also happened to be in a Barnes and Noble earlier today and spotted a book that's been out for a few years but still popular.  It's called \"The Daring Book for Girls\" (http://www.daringbookforgirls.com).  There's one for boys, too.  It's not specifically science oriented, but more just encouraging girls to be awesome and do lots of cool stuff.\n\nYou might also want to check out \"The Science Book for Girls\", \"Kiss My Math,\" and \"Cool Engineering Activities for Girls.\"  All geared toward girls in grade school, but good to bookmark for later.",
