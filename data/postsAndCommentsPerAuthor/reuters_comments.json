The best way experts say to get people to vote is to show how policies affect them, and often that’s by making it local. The presidential election can feel like this huge thing far away, but if there’s an issue in your city or state they care about -- the roads are terrible, kids aren’t in in-person school and they should be (or shouldn’t, depending on the area!), a new sports stadium is being considered -- whatever you can think of that you know they care about, point out which politicians have power over that. Local elections are often much closer than national ones, so it’s a way to show that votes really do matter. \n\nIf the coronavirus has taught us one thing, it’s how much affect city and state officials have over our lives. I’d say if they have a single criticism about how the coronavirus has been handled at your city, state, or national level, it’s a good reason to show up. \n\nYou don’t have to like politics to think that voting is important. It’s the policies that affect your commute, your education quality and costs, your 401K that you show up for. And if you think none of the candidates represent you, pick the one closest to your ideals. But don’t give up your voice. I hope that helps! (Also - they may just need help.

How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?\n\nThat’s exactly right. Most of the glacier retreat in Greenland over the past several decades can be attributed to warmer ocean water at the glacier fronts, which melts ice more rapidly and increases calving rates. Sometimes, depending on the slope of the ground underneath the ice, only a small amount of initial retreat can nudge the glacier out of balance and trigger additional retreat. \n\n\\-MK",

How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly right. Most of the glacier retreat in Greenland over the past several decades can be attributed to warmer ocean water at the glacier fronts, which melts ice more rapidly and increases calving rates. Sometimes, depending on the slope of the ground underneath the ice, only a small amount of initial retreat can nudge the glacier out of balance and trigger additional retreat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-MK&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That's why it's so important for us to have a formal education on the primary and secondary levels, and even to go to colleges and universities – and even maybe sometimes graduate and professional education. But I think the first key is preparation. Whatever you do, you must become an expert in the area that you choose.   \n  \nWhen a young person goes to college and through ROTC training, at the end of your four years, they become a commanding officer in the military. So you are a lieutenant, which means that you are able to be a commander of 20, maybe 25 troops.   \n     \n If you can command in the military at 21, why can't you run for school board? Why can't you run for county commissioner? Why can't you run for state legislative office? If young people can lead in the military, then they can lead in politics we need young people to go into politics and run for themselves in public service. And I think that's very, very important because if you look at the average age of someone in public office, it probably hovers around 57 to 58 years old. That's not a bad thing. It's just that young people should be involved in leading. Young leaders will run for office offering innovative ideas. Politics needs to be not just expanded, but retrofitted. It needs to see new fresh ideas all the time, and that's what young people bring to the table so that's a second thing I would encourage.  \n     \n  The final thing is that we need to look in the mirror. Instead of waiting to change your career and looking for someone to be your savior, you need to look in the mirror and look at yourself, because every one of us can do something, it does not have to be massive, everyone can do something to make a difference.   \n    \n There's a great educator by the name of Horace Mann and there's a quotation on his statue. It says 'Be ashamed to die until you win a victory for humanity.'   \n     \nThose are very powerful words because you may say, 'well, how can I win a victory of all humanity?'   \n     \nSome of us will win a victory on our street. Some of us could win victories in our neighborhood. Some can win victories at school. Some may win victories in our city, and some in our state. Some may win victories in our nation, and still some may even win victories for our world. But we can all do something to make the world in which we live better than it was when we arrived. - MLK3",

As parents, all we want is for you to be the best Martin you can be.' They told me I didn't have to go to Morehouse college, where my father went. I did go to Morehouse college. They told me I didn't have to join the ministry, and I never felt called to that path. They told me I didn't have to be a human rights leader, but I have felt called to do that.  \n    \n  I have always tried to be the best Martin I can be. I've never seen the name as a burden, I've seen it as a blessing. I've seen it as a way to bring people together. I think looking at it that way helped me tremendously. But I know that if I had chosen something else, my mother would have supported me and that's what's important. My late sister, for example, was an actress and she supported her.  \n    \n One of the first ways that I thought I could give back to the community was to run for public office. I was an elected leader in Atlanta for 7 years.  \n    \n What I can't say is, had I not been born into this family would I still be in public service? I like to think that I would, I have a passion and would like to make the world a better place for all God's children. That's also what my parents sought to do.  \n    \n I want to raise my daugher, Yolanda, who is 12, the same way. My wife and I raise her to be her best self, but she happens to have a passion for social justice and we feel that is wonderful and we would love for her to embrace that. But if she chooses not to, that is fine. We just want her to be the best she can be. And that's how my parents raised me.  \n    \n  There are days that I've been discouraged. And sometimes you have to take a break from the news, or from your iPad or phone. But you have to come back. Because we're going to be engaged in fighting for a long time. And the method I choose to fight is nonviolent resistance because I believe that yields permanent results if we do it right. - MLK3",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I am thankful for is how my mother raised me. I mean that she always told me that &amp;#39;you don&amp;#39;t have to follow in your father&amp;#39;s footsteps or in mine. As parents, all we want is for you to be the best Martin you can be.&amp;#39; They told me I didn&amp;#39;t have to go to Morehouse college, where my father went. I did go to Morehouse college. They told me I didn&amp;#39;t have to join the ministry, and I never felt called to that path. They told me I didn&amp;#39;t have to be a human rights leader, but I have felt called to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always tried to be the best Martin I can be. I&amp;#39;ve never seen the name as a burden, I&amp;#39;ve seen it as a blessing. I&amp;#39;ve seen it as a way to bring people together. I think looking at it that way helped me tremendously. But I know that if I had chosen something else, my mother would have supported me and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s important. My late sister, for example, was an actress and she supported her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first ways that I thought I could give back to the community was to run for public office. I was an elected leader in Atlanta for 7 years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I can&amp;#39;t say is, had I not been born into this family would I still be in public service? I like to think that I would, I have a passion and would like to make the world a better place for all God&amp;#39;s children. That&amp;#39;s also what my parents sought to do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to raise my daugher, Yolanda, who is 12, the same way. My wife and I raise her to be her best self, but she happens to have a passion for social justice and we feel that is wonderful and we would love for her to embrace that. But if she chooses not to, that is fine. We just want her to be the best she can be. And that&amp;#39;s how my parents raised me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are days that I&amp;#39;ve been discouraged. And sometimes you have to take a break from the news, or from your iPad or phone. But you have to come back. Because we&amp;#39;re going to be engaged in fighting for a long time. And the method I choose to fight is nonviolent resistance because I believe that yields permanent results if we do it right. - MLK3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I am tremendously inspired by the millions of young people I have seen demonstrating around our nation and the world after the tragic death of George Floyd and that the demonstrations continue despite some violence. People are protesting for something different. My dad used to say that &amp;#39;the greatness of democracy is the right to protest for our rights&amp;#39; so I&amp;#39;m more inspired by the young people than anything else. - MLK3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For SARS-CoV-2, this is usually the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (the part that binds ACE2 and allows the virus to get into a cell). T cells come in two basic flavors: CD4 (helper) and CD8 (killer). CD8 T cells kill infected cells so that they can’t make new virus. CD4 T cells coordinate immune responses: they tell B cells to make more, better antibodies and they tell CD8 T cells to go forth and unleash hell on infected cells. They also tell B cells and T cells to differentiate into memory cells after the acute infection is cleared, and memory CD4 cells can tell memory B cells to start cranking out antibodies and memory CD8 cells to start killing infected cells after another exposure to the virus.  \n\n\nCross-protection is when there’s enough similarity between a virus you’ve encountered before and one that you’re encountering now that these memory cells will respond to the new virus. This usually only happens with related viruses. You’re unlikely to trigger immune memory from a prior flu infection to a coronavirus infection. However, there are some indications that there may be cross-protective immunity in people previously infected with SARS classic or the common cold betacoronaviruses.

Masks work 100% or they don’t work at all. Vaccines are completely protective or they do nothing. Either you die from COVID-19 or you survive and are fully restored to health. We know that these are all false dichotomies and it’s more complex than that. By educating people on how science works, and acknowledging the uncertainty that’s baked into the scientific method, I find that it often makes people more willing to explore the nuances about what we know and what we don’t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-ALR&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The best way experts say to get people to vote is to show how policies affect them, and often that’s by making it local. The presidential election can feel like this huge thing far away, but if there’s an issue in your city or state they care about -- the roads are terrible, kids aren’t in in-person school and they should be (or shouldn’t, depending on the area!), a new sports stadium is being considered -- whatever you can think of that you know they care about, point out which politicians have power over that. Local elections are often much closer than national ones, so it’s a way to show that votes really do matter. \n\nIf the coronavirus has taught us one thing, it’s how much affect city and state officials have over our lives. I’d say if they have a single criticism about how the coronavirus has been handled at your city, state, or national level, it’s a good reason to show up. \n\nYou don’t have to like politics to think that voting is important. It’s the policies that affect your commute, your education quality and costs, your 401K that you show up for. And if you think none of the candidates represent you, pick the one closest to your ideals. But don’t give up your voice. I hope that helps! (Also - they may just need help.

How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?\n\nThat’s exactly right. Most of the glacier retreat in Greenland over the past several decades can be attributed to warmer ocean water at the glacier fronts, which melts ice more rapidly and increases calving rates. Sometimes, depending on the slope of the ground underneath the ice, only a small amount of initial retreat can nudge the glacier out of balance and trigger additional retreat. \n\n\\-MK",

How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly right. Most of the glacier retreat in Greenland over the past several decades can be attributed to warmer ocean water at the glacier fronts, which melts ice more rapidly and increases calving rates. Sometimes, depending on the slope of the ground underneath the ice, only a small amount of initial retreat can nudge the glacier out of balance and trigger additional retreat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-MK&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That's why it's so important for us to have a formal education on the primary and secondary levels, and even to go to colleges and universities – and even maybe sometimes graduate and professional education. But I think the first key is preparation. Whatever you do, you must become an expert in the area that you choose.   \n  \nWhen a young person goes to college and through ROTC training, at the end of your four years, they become a commanding officer in the military. So you are a lieutenant, which means that you are able to be a commander of 20, maybe 25 troops.   \n     \n If you can command in the military at 21, why can't you run for school board? Why can't you run for county commissioner? Why can't you run for state legislative office? If young people can lead in the military, then they can lead in politics we need young people to go into politics and run for themselves in public service. And I think that's very, very important because if you look at the average age of someone in public office, it probably hovers around 57 to 58 years old. That's not a bad thing. It's just that young people should be involved in leading. Young leaders will run for office offering innovative ideas. Politics needs to be not just expanded, but retrofitted. It needs to see new fresh ideas all the time, and that's what young people bring to the table so that's a second thing I would encourage.  \n     \n  The final thing is that we need to look in the mirror. Instead of waiting to change your career and looking for someone to be your savior, you need to look in the mirror and look at yourself, because every one of us can do something, it does not have to be massive, everyone can do something to make a difference.   \n    \n There's a great educator by the name of Horace Mann and there's a quotation on his statue. It says 'Be ashamed to die until you win a victory for humanity.'   \n     \nThose are very powerful words because you may say, 'well, how can I win a victory of all humanity?'   \n     \nSome of us will win a victory on our street. Some of us could win victories in our neighborhood. Some can win victories at school. Some may win victories in our city, and some in our state. Some may win victories in our nation, and still some may even win victories for our world. But we can all do something to make the world in which we live better than it was when we arrived. - MLK3",

As parents, all we want is for you to be the best Martin you can be.' They told me I didn't have to go to Morehouse college, where my father went. I did go to Morehouse college. They told me I didn't have to join the ministry, and I never felt called to that path. They told me I didn't have to be a human rights leader, but I have felt called to do that.  \n    \n  I have always tried to be the best Martin I can be. I've never seen the name as a burden, I've seen it as a blessing. I've seen it as a way to bring people together. I think looking at it that way helped me tremendously. But I know that if I had chosen something else, my mother would have supported me and that's what's important. My late sister, for example, was an actress and she supported her.  \n    \n One of the first ways that I thought I could give back to the community was to run for public office. I was an elected leader in Atlanta for 7 years.  \n    \n What I can't say is, had I not been born into this family would I still be in public service? I like to think that I would, I have a passion and would like to make the world a better place for all God's children. That's also what my parents sought to do.  \n    \n I want to raise my daugher, Yolanda, who is 12, the same way. My wife and I raise her to be her best self, but she happens to have a passion for social justice and we feel that is wonderful and we would love for her to embrace that. But if she chooses not to, that is fine. We just want her to be the best she can be. And that's how my parents raised me.  \n    \n  There are days that I've been discouraged. And sometimes you have to take a break from the news, or from your iPad or phone. But you have to come back. Because we're going to be engaged in fighting for a long time. And the method I choose to fight is nonviolent resistance because I believe that yields permanent results if we do it right. - MLK3",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I am thankful for is how my mother raised me. I mean that she always told me that &amp;#39;you don&amp;#39;t have to follow in your father&amp;#39;s footsteps or in mine. As parents, all we want is for you to be the best Martin you can be.&amp;#39; They told me I didn&amp;#39;t have to go to Morehouse college, where my father went. I did go to Morehouse college. They told me I didn&amp;#39;t have to join the ministry, and I never felt called to that path. They told me I didn&amp;#39;t have to be a human rights leader, but I have felt called to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always tried to be the best Martin I can be. I&amp;#39;ve never seen the name as a burden, I&amp;#39;ve seen it as a blessing. I&amp;#39;ve seen it as a way to bring people together. I think looking at it that way helped me tremendously. But I know that if I had chosen something else, my mother would have supported me and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s important. My late sister, for example, was an actress and she supported her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first ways that I thought I could give back to the community was to run for public office. I was an elected leader in Atlanta for 7 years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I can&amp;#39;t say is, had I not been born into this family would I still be in public service? I like to think that I would, I have a passion and would like to make the world a better place for all God&amp;#39;s children. That&amp;#39;s also what my parents sought to do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to raise my daugher, Yolanda, who is 12, the same way. My wife and I raise her to be her best self, but she happens to have a passion for social justice and we feel that is wonderful and we would love for her to embrace that. But if she chooses not to, that is fine. We just want her to be the best she can be. And that&amp;#39;s how my parents raised me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are days that I&amp;#39;ve been discouraged. And sometimes you have to take a break from the news, or from your iPad or phone. But you have to come back. Because we&amp;#39;re going to be engaged in fighting for a long time. And the method I choose to fight is nonviolent resistance because I believe that yields permanent results if we do it right. - MLK3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I am tremendously inspired by the millions of young people I have seen demonstrating around our nation and the world after the tragic death of George Floyd and that the demonstrations continue despite some violence. People are protesting for something different. My dad used to say that &amp;#39;the greatness of democracy is the right to protest for our rights&amp;#39; so I&amp;#39;m more inspired by the young people than anything else. - MLK3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For SARS-CoV-2, this is usually the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (the part that binds ACE2 and allows the virus to get into a cell). T cells come in two basic flavors: CD4 (helper) and CD8 (killer). CD8 T cells kill infected cells so that they can’t make new virus. CD4 T cells coordinate immune responses: they tell B cells to make more, better antibodies and they tell CD8 T cells to go forth and unleash hell on infected cells. They also tell B cells and T cells to differentiate into memory cells after the acute infection is cleared, and memory CD4 cells can tell memory B cells to start cranking out antibodies and memory CD8 cells to start killing infected cells after another exposure to the virus.  \n\n\nCross-protection is when there’s enough similarity between a virus you’ve encountered before and one that you’re encountering now that these memory cells will respond to the new virus. This usually only happens with related viruses. You’re unlikely to trigger immune memory from a prior flu infection to a coronavirus infection. However, there are some indications that there may be cross-protective immunity in people previously infected with SARS classic or the common cold betacoronaviruses.

Masks work 100% or they don’t work at all. Vaccines are completely protective or they do nothing. Either you die from COVID-19 or you survive and are fully restored to health. We know that these are all false dichotomies and it’s more complex than that. By educating people on how science works, and acknowledging the uncertainty that’s baked into the scientific method, I find that it often makes people more willing to explore the nuances about what we know and what we don’t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-ALR&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Every Reuters reporter that could maybe cover something remotely dangerous is required to have hostile environment training, set up and paid for by the company. When I was a stringer in El Paso they paid for my flight and hotel to DC for the two-day course where we learned how to stay safe in a riot, how to take cover from gunfire, and how to manage ourselves in a natural disaster.\n\nWe also got first aid training and a med kit, which I keep on me when reporting on things like this. The training obviously paid off, because I was able to quickly get my med kit out and treat my injured security advisor who had been shot in the face by a plastic bullet and had cut his hands and wrists open as we ran to safety\n\nWe are also all sent out with bulletproof vests, gas masks, ballistic glasses, and helmets.\n\nWhile I feel safe with Reuters, freelance reporters who work for other outlets are often not offered the same safety training and gear.\n\nI personally believe agencies should not send their reporters to dangerous situations without keeping them safe, something I'm fortunate Reuters does for all staff and freelancers. - JCC",

Every Reuters reporter that could maybe cover something remotely dangerous is required to have hostile environment training, set up and paid for by the company. When I was a stringer in El Paso they paid for my flight and hotel to DC for the two-day course where we learned how to stay safe in a riot, how to take cover from gunfire, and how to manage ourselves in a natural disaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also got first aid training and a med kit, which I keep on me when reporting on things like this. The training obviously paid off, because I was able to quickly get my med kit out and treat my injured security advisor who had been shot in the face by a plastic bullet and had cut his hands and wrists open as we ran to safety&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are also all sent out with bulletproof vests, gas masks, ballistic glasses, and helmets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I feel safe with Reuters, freelance reporters who work for other outlets are often not offered the same safety training and gear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally believe agencies should not send their reporters to dangerous situations without keeping them safe, something I&amp;#39;m fortunate Reuters does for all staff and freelancers. - JCC&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Your brain will be focused on trying to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong. So the key is to focus not on what they are thinking but getting really curious about trying to understand: Why do they need or want to believe in this? What are their motivations? What has led them to this belief? Respectful curiosity can help foster trust between people, parties and factions with opposing views. - Rachel",

Your brain will be focused on trying to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong. So the key is to focus not on what they are thinking but getting really curious about trying to understand: Why do they need or want to believe in this? What are their motivations? What has led them to this belief? Respectful curiosity can help foster trust between people, parties and factions with opposing views. - Rachel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
