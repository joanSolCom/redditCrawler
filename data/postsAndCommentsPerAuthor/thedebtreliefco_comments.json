We grew tired of seeing people burdened by credit card debt being taking advantage of so we formed what is now The Debt Relief Company.

Not to sound overly altruistic but we formed out of a desire to provide Americans with legitimate and honest help and provide free financial advice whenever possible. We charge no up-front fees and most of the time we postpone client fees for months to years so long as it helps their bottom-line and helps them get their life back on track. We like to think that customer service and people come first, not profits. The inspiration and idea for our company came about over a decade ago during the financial crisis when our co-founders began helping an aunt with a debt negotiation plan and another family member with a mortgage modification.\n\nFor anyone still working towards financial independence, reach out for a free consultation.

If you don’t, we suggest you do some self learning and try to educate yourself as much as possible. Anywhere you apply will screen you early on to make sure you have the required knowledge/skills to be successful in the position. In order to become a financial consultant/counselor with us you would have to take a full-time two week course &amp;amp; training program followed by two exams. Minimum requirements include bachelors in finance, economics, business or any other related field. Prior experience in related fields is always a plus! We are not currently hiring as we currently have a backlog of potential new hires but we will ideally be hiring in the short to intermediate term. We will also have other positions available depending on your experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Claiming bankruptcy is always an option, but it isn’t as easy as it used to be and may or may not be the best decision for you. First thing you must ask yourself is if you qualify for a Chapter 7 and if you will pass the Means test. Many clients we have worked with have tried to claim bankruptcy but did not qualify for a Chapter 7, since it has become much more difficult to qualify for after BAPCA passed. If you only qualify for a Chapter 13 (which is essentially a debt repayment plan very similar to the debt resolution program we offer—except a Chapter 13 typically carries more drawbacks and more negative consequences than a debt relief program), it would probably be best to find a better option than a Chapter 13. Bankruptcy isn’t what it used to be since BAPCA passed over a decade ago but it can definitely be the right move to make depending on your situation. The downsides associated with claiming bankruptcy are long term (7+ years) and all bankruptcies become public knowledge (see Donald Trump for e.g.). So again, it would really depend on what kind of debt you're carrying and what you can qualify for. So to answer your question in the most unbiased way possible (sorry we have strong opinions about this stuff!), if the choice is between a Chapter 13 and a debt resolution program, the best option is typically the debt relief program as you are receiving essentially all the same benefits of a Chapter 13 without many of the associated negatives.",

The grace period is the gap between when your billing cycle ends and when your payment is due. So, you are entitled to at least 21 days of interest free charges during this time period. Once you fall out of the grace period (meaning you did not pay your statement balance in full) you would be subject to daily interest charges. So essentially, if you fall out of the grace period and want to get back into it (meaning you don’t want to pay your credit card company any interest for charges) you can pay the FULL balance by the end of the billing cycle (this is tricky though because if there are pending charges you can still get charged interest unless you do this correctly and make sure it’s zero balance on the last day of the period) or you can make sure you’ve paid your statement balance to zero for two consecutive billing periods. The main thing to understand is that as long as you do not have a running balance at the end of the billing period you will never pay interest. If you really want to make money on cash back rewards and points and take money from banks as opposed to giving them money, just make sure to always have your statement balance paid. Your rewards/cash back should be higher than whatever the merchant charges are for the credit card so you are actually making money off your creditor and credit card! Hope this makes sense!",

So, in comparison to the US National debt (the government spends somewhere around 150-200% of what they earn each year and debt to GDP is over 100%—may have changed more recently feel free to fact check), in comparison, the proportion of household debt to income is a walk in the park (household debt to GDP is approximately 75% in the US).
