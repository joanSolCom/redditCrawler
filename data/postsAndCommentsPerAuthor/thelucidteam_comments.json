We were one rank away from being right on the homepage (we hovered at #16, and at #15 you can be seen by everyone without having to click \"more posts\") That one rank made a huge difference, and was ultimately the difference between being a huge success and a semi-success. However, we learned a lot and would be happy to share those learnings! We found a top hunter to hunt our product, and because of that we got featured within a couple of hours of posting. We also posted right at midnight PST. These two things helped us a lot.\n\nNow, for our shortcomings. We're based on the East Coast, so the product was posted at 3 AM our time. We had our first comment go up automatically upon going live. But all outreach to our community was scheduled for the morning. We thought that no one would be on Product Hunt early, this was wrong. We could've reached out to users in Asia, who would've helped us solidify our position in the early morning. Once the East/West Coast wakes up and starts upvoting everything in the top 15, it's extremely difficult to beat that.\n\nSo I'd recommend building your community and mailing list very early on, tell them about your launch as soon as possible, so that once you go live you have a huge wave of support. That helps boost you in the algorithm significantly. And try to have someone notable in the community hunt you.",

I take medication and will continue to for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry to hear of your challenges over the years. Trauma is a really hard thing to work through, and I am sending some love and strength your way. I am really happy to hear that you have found solace through music and art through. I vividly remember living with my father after losing my apartment and I literally played piano pretty much all day. Its a powerful thing, I hope it. continues to bring you happiness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, yes, this has unfortunately happened throughout most of my adult life. Sadly when the meteorite crashed into my world and I was in crisis, pretty much all of my friends disappeared out of fear. I still have some difficulties managing some relationships, but it has certainly become much easier, and I think I found the &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; people after all. I love my friends very much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

No worries about all the questions, I will tackle them one by one: \n\n1: The short answer for this one is no, there have been no correlations made between certain musical patterns helping people with specific diagnoses. We are currently undergoing our first pre-clinical study to determine efficacy on the moderate to severe anxiety population, but even then it's looking like the music needed varies person to person. We have however found strong correlations of music working effectively for people in acute mental states. For instance, if someone is having a moment of panic, then we can respond to that. But I would say there is one sequence for the entire life experience of a diagnosis, it's more about what they need in that moment :) \n\n2: This is certainly in our future! Were just working on the validations studies right now. Once we get a bit more peer-reviewed work, this will certainly be in our sights! \n\n3: This is not something we have measured yet, but we are planning on doing so soon. \n\n4: Again, nothing science-grade but we have had beautiful verbatims from our users saying that our app helped their quality of life greatly while on heavy doses of medications. \n\nHave a lovely day!",
