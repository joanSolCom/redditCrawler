And [questions still remain](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2020/misconduct-allegation-against-appellate-judge-remained-private-for-years/) about how the bar groups handled a serious ethical allegation against Supreme Court candidate Shelly Harris. \n\nNevertheless, they are an important lens through which to understand judges and we include them in our judicial guide.

And &lt;a href=\"https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2020/misconduct-allegation-against-appellate-judge-remained-private-for-years/\"&gt;questions still remain&lt;/a&gt; about how the bar groups handled a serious ethical allegation against Supreme Court candidate Shelly Harris. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they are an important lens through which to understand judges and we include them in our judicial guide.
