        "body": "Bill: to me, there are different types of scary.  But in the traditional spooky sense, my parents live in a old house that they're convinced is haunted.  My brother felt a woman with long hair lie down next to him in his bedroom in the attic once.  While my experience isn't that scary, at one point, I felt this thumping at the head of my bed one night.  It was in a pattern, once about every half second.  It was soft, but very clearly there.  It didn't miss a beat - just kept going.  It was about 3 in the morning in the middle of winter so it was dead silent.  I was the only one in town and home alone that night, so I was unsettled.  It went on for about a minute before I mustered the courage to kind of thump my head against the pillow (it felt like it was someone pressing down right under my pillow).  It stopped for about 6 seconds and then started up at a faster beat.  Now I was really freaked and frozen.  \n\nI thought of my brothers story, and my sisters story about the shower just turning on behind her one night while she was brushing her teeth.

But in the traditional spooky sense, my parents live in a old house that they&amp;#39;re convinced is haunted.  My brother felt a woman with long hair lie down next to him in his bedroom in the attic once.  While my experience isn&amp;#39;t that scary, at one point, I felt this thumping at the head of my bed one night.  It was in a pattern, once about every half second.  It was soft, but very clearly there.  It didn&amp;#39;t miss a beat - just kept going.  It was about 3 in the morning in the middle of winter so it was dead silent.  I was the only one in town and home alone that night, so I was unsettled.  It went on for about a minute before I mustered the courage to kind of thump my head against the pillow (it felt like it was someone pressing down right under my pillow).  It stopped for about 6 seconds and then started up at a faster beat.  Now I was really freaked and frozen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of my brothers story, and my sisters story about the shower just turning on behind her one night while she was brushing her teeth.

        "body": "Thank you for the kind words!\n\n1) I am a lifelong, diehard Nintendo fan.  I'm obsessed and have always wanted to bring a game to it.  Always made me sad to work on all the BioShock games and not be able to get it on a Nintendo platform.  But it's also that Switch is the perfect fit!  The idea of taking a narrative rich, immersive game anywhere really spoke to me.  I love my 3DS and Vita, but I feel like they don't really reach the full potential in terms of atmosphere.  No more!

My brother felt a woman with long hair lie down next to him in his bedroom in the attic once.  While my experience isn't that scary, at one point, I felt this thumping at the head of my bed one night.  It was in a pattern, once about every half second.  It was soft, but very clearly there.  It didn't miss a beat - just kept going.  It was about 3 in the morning in the middle of winter so it was dead silent.  I was the only one in town and home alone that night, so I was unsettled.  It went on for about a minute before I mustered the courage to kind of thump my head against the pillow (it felt like it was someone pressing down right under my pillow).  It stopped for about 6 seconds and then started up at a faster beat.  Now I was really freaked and frozen.  \n\nI thought of my brothers story, and my sisters story about the shower just turning on behind her one night while she was brushing her teeth.  The thumping continued and I started to get angry.  I slammed head down much harder and it stopped again.  Silence.  Then, about 30 seconds later, I hear this groaning swelling up in the gas heating pipes in the corner.  It gets louder and louder until the radiator absolutely slammed in a loud thud.  I quickly got up, rushed downstairs, put on my shoes and drove to McDonald's. Hung out in the parking lot for about an hour before driving around and heading home as the sun rose.  Didn't go back upstairs though. ",

Lots of designer tend to fall in love with their ideas and not really think about the context fully.\n\nThat's what it all comes down to: context.  As long as you've given players enough tools to adapt to the change, you should be fine.  It's really important to keep players on their toes by not only building on what they've learned, but twisting it, adding to it, and subverting it.  As long as you've taken proper steps to ease people into the change, you should be fine.  Additionally, putting systems in place that can adapt to players who aren't \"getting it\" can go a long way.\n\n",

I love that you are thinking about things from the player&amp;#39;s perspective.  This is crucial.  Lots of designer tend to fall in love with their ideas and not really think about the context fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what it all comes down to: context.  As long as you&amp;#39;ve given players enough tools to adapt to the change, you should be fine.  It&amp;#39;s really important to keep players on their toes by not only building on what they&amp;#39;ve learned, but twisting it, adding to it, and subverting it.  As long as you&amp;#39;ve taken proper steps to ease people into the change, you should be fine.  Additionally, putting systems in place that can adapt to players who aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;getting it&amp;quot; can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That may sounds a bit crass, but in reality, with each step - whether it's learning Unreal, building a small sequence, blogging about game design, etc - sets you apart.\n\nI can't stress enough how important it is to just download Unreal and watch some intro videos and tweak.  You may fall in love and find yourself building a mock combat sequence for Gears of War, or a narrative bit for a mock BioShock room.  Just build something.  Build some bad stuff so you can get to the good, then, eventually, the amazing.",

Make sure that whatever you&amp;#39;re doing while in school, you are building toward stuff to show off.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find projects to tackle and nail them.  Learning the academic stuff is hugely valuable, but not nearly as much as hands-on experience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make absolutely certain to set goals (e.g. at least one portfolio-ready app or combat sequence built a semester).  Then, follow through with them so you don&amp;#39;t leave school with just a degree and a hangover. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But yes, it also means that we have to find ways to keep the environments varied.  One of the ways we try to do this is by going bold with the architecture.  \n\nI think the monochromatic look does really help make thing pop when you do see color, through things like Cassie's memories or ghosts.  When you think about it, Star Wars is a very monochromatic film from shot-to-shot.  Think about the Death Star.  It's practically a black and white film!  This makes the lightsabers and blasters pop even more.  The eye craves that contrast and it helps focus on the stars of the shots.  I'm not going to knock the prequels, but because everything was so colorful, you get a bit fatigued.  (for the record, I love Episode III)",

This gives Echo Bluff a fresh look.  But yes, it also means that we have to find ways to keep the environments varied.  One of the ways we try to do this is by going bold with the architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the monochromatic look does really help make thing pop when you do see color, through things like Cassie&amp;#39;s memories or ghosts.  When you think about it, Star Wars is a very monochromatic film from shot-to-shot.  Think about the Death Star.  It&amp;#39;s practically a black and white film!  This makes the lightsabers and blasters pop even more.  The eye craves that contrast and it helps focus on the stars of the shots.  I&amp;#39;m not going to knock the prequels, but because everything was so colorful, you get a bit fatigued.  (for the record, I love Episode III)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
