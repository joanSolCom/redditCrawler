If the weekly core audience is similarly dedicated, we could get five years or more. In the meantime, we expect digital readership to grow significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Mark Newman, whose health software company Nomi Health [has a $5 million contract with the state](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/22/silicon-slopes-companies/) to run the group’s testing, said comparing TestUtah’s results with those of other sites is “not apples to apples.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“We’re talking about population differences,” agreed Brent Satterfield, founder and chief science officer of Co-Diagnostics Inc., which produces the test kit used by TestUtah’s sites.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But according to state data obtained by The Tribune, TestUtah has reported test results for symptomatic patients separately — and even for those patients, positive results are far below those reported at other test sites in the state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;About 2% of symptomatic patients at TestUtah’s sites have tested positive for coronavirus since April 1, according to the state’s data. That’s less than half of the 5% of patients testing positive at other Utah sites.",

Mark Newman, whose health software company Nomi Health &lt;a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/22/silicon-slopes-companies/\"&gt;has a $5 million contract with the state&lt;/a&gt; to run the group’s testing, said comparing TestUtah’s results with those of other sites is “not apples to apples.”  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re talking about population differences,” agreed Brent Satterfield, founder and chief science officer of Co-Diagnostics Inc., which produces the test kit used by TestUtah’s sites.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But according to state data obtained by The Tribune, TestUtah has reported test results for symptomatic patients separately — and even for those patients, positive results are far below those reported at other test sites in the state.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 2% of symptomatic patients at TestUtah’s sites have tested positive for coronavirus since April 1, according to the state’s data. That’s less than half of the 5% of patients testing positive at other Utah sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Here's one key quote: \"One [2015 review of nine studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25858901) found that real-life use of surgical masks did not reduce infections compared to no masks — except for the study that said they did. One [review of studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190272/) said masks helped during SARS (a type of coronavirus), one [review said](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300858) they didn’t during pandemic flu. There are dozens of other studies, and they are not any more authoritative.\" It's weird: you'd think they'd help a lot, but the evidence is really inconclusive.\n\nBut what masks definitely help is stopping the wearer from sneezing, coughing, talking loudly, singing, whatever, and spreading their own particles everywhere. What we've found is that much of the spread, and maybe even most of the \"superspreader\" events come from asymptomatic people. People don't know when they're most susceptible to spreading this, and even cloth masks help that. This New England Journal of Medicine [article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758) has a good discussion on that.\n\nAs a side note, I don't love the study you linked. I wish I knew more about the cloth masks they're using... they say they're two-layer cotton or three-layer woven material, but what thread count? Etc. [This study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252) I thought did a better job of comparing types of material used in cloth masks.",

If something I or a source says doesn't make sense to you, either due to bad explanation or weird results, look for another source of information on the same thing.

What we have to do when using data to make decisions is account for that garbage.\n\nSo to address your specific concerns:\n\n1. A ton of different companies are making antibody tests right now, with a wide range of reliability. When we do serology tests, we have to take a large possibility of false negatives or false positives into account. Good study designers do this, though.\n2. The death numbers are flawed, to be sure. Which direction they're flawed in is an interesting question. Yes, there are those whose COVID-19 is only a last straw to an otherwise imminent death. But there are also those who die at home without being tested. Regardless, it's clear [that overall deaths](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/04/27/covid-19-death-toll-undercounted/?arc404=true) are up in a big way.\n3. Prediction models are going to suffer in the face of limited data and knowledge... and that's certainly the case for many of the early models. In general, taking into account the wide band that these models predict is wise, rather than focusing on a specific guesstimate. I wrote about [the trouble with models](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/03/31/andy-larsen-estimating/) here.\n\nEssentially, the good data scientists are doing their best to figure out those questions. When you hear someone eliminating data as a source of decision making, though, to me, you're likely dealing with someone with an agenda.",

When we do serology tests, we have to take a large possibility of false negatives or false positives into account. Good study designers do this, though.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The death numbers are flawed, to be sure. Which direction they&amp;#39;re flawed in is an interesting question. Yes, there are those whose COVID-19 is only a last straw to an otherwise imminent death. But there are also those who die at home without being tested. Regardless, it&amp;#39;s clear &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/04/27/covid-19-death-toll-undercounted/?arc404=true\"&gt;that overall deaths&lt;/a&gt; are up in a big way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prediction models are going to suffer in the face of limited data and knowledge... and that&amp;#39;s certainly the case for many of the early models. In general, taking into account the wide band that these models predict is wise, rather than focusing on a specific guesstimate. I wrote about &lt;a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/03/31/andy-larsen-estimating/\"&gt;the trouble with models&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the good data scientists are doing their best to figure out those questions. When you hear someone eliminating data as a source of decision making, though, to me, you&amp;#39;re likely dealing with someone with an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

When I look at a lot of the big super-spread events, [many of them involve activities](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/24/what-you-need-know-about/) with a lot of upper-respiratory viral shedding: singing, laughing, yelling. I'm not an expert on this, but it sure feels like exercise would lead to a lot of droplets in the air in a similar way. When you add in all of the reusing of equipment, poor ventilation (it doesn't smell great when I walk in the gym I usually go to), the number of people in one room and more... I'm legitimately shocked that they're part of many initial phases of reopening. I get that people can stay at least 6 feet away from each other, but we know by now that it's not just about 6 feet.\n\nSalons I feel a little bit better about. Yes, they're a more intimate experience, but I think any spread would be more one-to-one rather than one-to-many. With masks religiously used by both parties throughout, religious handwashing and face-touching avoidance, I think there's only a moderate chance of infection for both.\n\nThat being said: these are hunches based on what I know about how this disease is spread.

When I look at a lot of the big super-spread events, &lt;a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/24/what-you-need-know-about/\"&gt;many of them involve activities&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of upper-respiratory viral shedding: singing, laughing, yelling. I&amp;#39;m not an expert on this, but it sure feels like exercise would lead to a lot of droplets in the air in a similar way. When you add in all of the reusing of equipment, poor ventilation (it doesn&amp;#39;t smell great when I walk in the gym I usually go to), the number of people in one room and more... I&amp;#39;m legitimately shocked that they&amp;#39;re part of many initial phases of reopening. I get that people can stay at least 6 feet away from each other, but we know by now that it&amp;#39;s not just about 6 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salons I feel a little bit better about. Yes, they&amp;#39;re a more intimate experience, but I think any spread would be more one-to-one rather than one-to-many. With masks religiously used by both parties throughout, religious handwashing and face-touching avoidance, I think there&amp;#39;s only a moderate chance of infection for both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said: these are hunches based on what I know about how this disease is spread.
