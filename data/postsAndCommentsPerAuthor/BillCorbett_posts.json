Ask me anything! I'll try to answer as many Qs as I can.\n\nI would also love to let everyone know about the online benefit performance of my comedy HATE MAIL, co-written with Kira Obolensky, tomorrow night.\n\nI'm incredibly excited about the cast: **RHEA SEEHORN** of TV's *BETTER CALL SAUL* and **PAUL F. TOMPKINS** of *BOJACK HORSEMAN*, *MR. SHOW*, etc., comedy and podcast legend in general.  I've been lucky enough to work with both of these wonderful performers in the past and I'm so so grateful they've agreed to do this. Based on seeing our one (one!) rehearsal, they are going to be amazing together.  Here's where to get tickets:\n\n[https://hatemail.simpletix.com/e/53553](https://hatemail.simpletix.com/e/53553)\n\nAbout the play: HATE MAIL was written about 20 years ago, starting as a sort of parody of the popular theater piece LOVE LETTERS.  It was meant to be performed likewise, just two actors with a simple set reading correspondence. The play has had a really nice life in theaters for the past two decades and it just seemed like a natural fit for these days of pandemic-y online performances.\n\nALL proceeds from the play will go to **PARTNERS IN HEALTH**, a great non-profit organization dedicated to getting medical health and supplies to those who need it most.  And their specific focus on the Coronavirus pandemic has been excellent:\n\n[https://www.pih.org/coronavirus-response](https://www.pih.org/coronavirus-response)\n\nAll that said! Please ask away. I'll be there answering away until about 1 pm eastern, 10 am pacific but will stop by as much as possible to answer Qs for a few hours after that too.  Looking forward to this!\n\n**\\[ADDED SEVERAL HOURS LATER:**  Thank you all!  I got to as many questions as I could and I'll stop by for a bit in a few hours, to see if I can or should answer a few more.  FWIW I tended to skip past questions where I'd already answered something very similar and / or where multiple-part questions made it tough to handle right now. Will be back later, but if your Q fits that bill and I haven't gotten there yet, that might be why.  Cheers, more soon..\\]",

You can get a little preview here:\n\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/balloonland\n\nThat is enough. Enough, I say.  Let's chat.  \n\nAM! A! AMA! \n\n**_______________________**\n\n**UPDATE:** Friends, I've been answering questions for the past 3.5 hours and need to go now and deal with family stuff.  (Good wholesome stuff like kids and dinner, not crime family intrigue.)\n\nI will try to come back later tonight and answer some questions I didn't get to, but it's looking like there's too many to answer every one in detail.  So sorry if I missed yours. \n\nTHANK YOU for hanging out with me here, I've really enjoyed it!  And I am grateful for your interest in all this odd stuff I do for a living.  Cheers! \n\n**_______________________**\n\n**FINAL UPDATE:**  \n\n\"The fiiiiinaaall upddaaaaaaaattteee....\" [cue Gob Bluth music]\n\nI came back and answered a whole bunch more questions and think I got a goodly percentage of 'em!  Questions I didn't get to were ones where it felt like I'd answered already with the similar Q, elsewhere on the page.  But apologies if anyone felt left out.  \n\nI can't thank you enough for the conversation, and the interest, and in general for being such lovely people. I had a lot of fun and hope you did too.

Enough, I say.  Let&amp;#39;s chat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AM! A! AMA! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_______________________&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Friends, I&amp;#39;ve been answering questions for the past 3.5 hours and need to go now and deal with family stuff.  (Good wholesome stuff like kids and dinner, not crime family intrigue.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will try to come back later tonight and answer some questions I didn&amp;#39;t get to, but it&amp;#39;s looking like there&amp;#39;s too many to answer every one in detail.  So sorry if I missed yours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU for hanging out with me here, I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed it!  And I am grateful for your interest in all this odd stuff I do for a living.  Cheers! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_______________________&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The fiiiiinaaall upddaaaaaaaattteee....&amp;quot; [cue Gob Bluth music]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came back and answered a whole bunch more questions and think I got a goodly percentage of &amp;#39;em!  Questions I didn&amp;#39;t get to were ones where it felt like I&amp;#39;d answered already with the similar Q, elsewhere on the page.  But apologies if anyone felt left out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t thank you enough for the conversation, and the interest, and in general for being such lovely people. I had a lot of fun and hope you did too.  Rock the heck on and THANK YOU, see you back here again sometime!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If you never heard of me: I'm one of the three RiffTrax guys, along with my former partners at MST3K, Michael J. Nelson and Kevin Murphy.  This summer we'll celebrate six years of RiffTrax. I'm happy to chat about RiffTrax, MST3K, the comic book I'm creating with artist Len Peralta, and life in general.  Except for hats. I do not want to talk about hats.\n\nFor proof this is me, check with this clown on Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/BillCorbett\n\n\nUPDATE: I have to go and do some stuff for a few hours, but I'll be back later to answer more Qs. Thanks everyone, it's fun talking to you all. (Except YOU, Gary.)\n\n\nUPDATE 2: Answered a few more Qs, now have to take a break for dinner and then puppy school for the new dog. Because I can't live with doggie pee stains. \"ONLY MY OWN\" is house policy.  \n\nBe back later tonight!  Thanks.\n\nUPDATE 3:  OK, just spent a few hours answering some more questions.  But this old man has to get his rest now. That's we roll in The Home. \n\nAnyway, more tomorrow.  Thanks Internet pals, this is a blast.\n\nUPDATE 4:  I'm baaaaaaack.  Wednesday AM.  Will spend a few hours mopping up some questions I missed, because I am the janitor OF YOUR MIND.  (Forgive me if I skip some that repeat previous questions, trying to get to as many as I can without repeating the same stuff.)\n\nTHANK YOU for all your questions, interest, nice comments. I'll spend some more time here tomorrow answering Qs, but I'm starting to wonder if I can actually get to all of them because there might too many to handle.  So maybe look at the answers already there and see if I've gotten to a version of your Q?  I dunno.  \n\nUPDATE 5: Wednesday afternoon.  Just spent some quality time here, but now have to get back to my day job.  I'm flattered and overwhelmed by all the Qs, but it looks like I won't be able to get to all of them.  But I WILL pop by here and there over the next few days and try to get to more of 'em, especially if they're Qs I haven't answered in some way before.  Thank you!  Carry on!\n\nUPDATE 6:  Friday afternoon. Spending about 90 minutes answering a few more questions I couldn't get to, then I will leave you in peace.\n\nUPDATE 7:  Later Friday afternoon: wrapping up here after answering a bunch more Qs.  Sorry I had to leave so many unanswered, but it seems like people have wisely moved on to other threads anyway.  Go with them!  LIVE, whatever you do!\n\nI'm very grateful for your time and interest, people of Reddit. It was fun to hang out with you all over the last few days.  Thank you!",

(I KNOW, doesn't seem like a good idea for a place to hire me to do that... nonetheless it's true!)\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions. \n\n**UPDATE SEVERAL HOURS LATER:**  \n\nDear Reddit friends, thank you!  I have to go attend to my life, my family, my burning house for a while.  I'll try to come back later and answer some more Qs if there are still some unaddressed.   In any case, thanks so much for chatting with me. You're awesome.  I had a blast.  \n\n**ANOTHER UPDATE:**\n\nBack.  Going to hang around for another hour or so and answer a few last questions.  My answers will be beautiful, as will our time together.  I'll say goodbye before I hit the road!  \n\n**FINAL UPDATE:**\n\nI am flattered beyond belief by this response.  Flatterers!  Really, thank you so much.  Gotta go back to my civilian, non-IAmA life now, but I answered as many questions as I could.  Hope you had as much fun as I did.  Very grateful, thanks pals.  Goodnight.
