With the recent changes to the Amazon Brand Registry (the new requirement that you own a trademark registration for your brand) it definitely makes sense to do one there.\n\nAs to your first question, you are right to point out that trademarks for clothing items are unique, which I actually just covered in a [blog post here](https://www.iregistertrademarks.com/clothing-trademark/).  Slapping a word or phrase on a shirt is called \"ornamental\" use, meaning that people are buying the product because they like what it says, not because they perceive the word/phrase as the *source* of the product.  That is why a label/tag/sticker with the brand name is necessary for it to be considered a *trademark* use.  You are also correct that registrations can be issued where the applicant only submits a photo of the front of the shirt, not a label/tag/sticker.  The reason is that these marks are going on the Supplemental Register, not the Principal Register.  Basically, this means that the registration owner does not get the broad protection that you get with most trademark registrations.  Instead, it reserves a spot at the Trademark Office where other people cannot register similar names for similar products.  If over time people start to recognize the word/phrase on the shirt as representing a brand, *then* the owner can apply again to get on the Principal Register.  So these registrations exist, but are mostly placeholders preventing the registration of similar marks.\n\nAs to your second question, I realize this might not be the most satisfying answer, but I encourage my clients to register their trademarks as a sort of \"insurance\" in case the big companies with deep pockets come after them.  If your registration is legitimate and you have priority, it makes it a lot more difficult for them to try and bully.  This is one of the best and cheapest deterrents for small businesses, because of course it's going to be next to impossible to compete $ for $ in expensive infringement litigation.",

They spend thousands on domains, logos, web design, promotional products, signage, and may be using something that infringes upon someone else's trademark rights.\n\nI help my clients avoid being forced to rebrand after costly infringement litigation by performing trademark searches and registering trademarks with the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office.\n\nPlease check out my website at [IRegisterTrademarks.com](http://www.IRegisterTrademarks.com).

And I could tell you what I think, but ultimately it just doesn’t matter.  It doesn’t help that you would ultimately be parodying these brands for your own commercial gain.  That does not weigh in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds like a cop out, but I work with an attorney that was involved with the North Face parody: “The South Butt.”  It settled, because that’s just what happens in these types of situations.  It’s very risky and expensive trying to get a fair use judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

With the recent changes to the Amazon Brand Registry (the new requirement that you own a trademark registration for your brand) it definitely makes sense to do one there.\n\nAs to your first question, you are right to point out that trademarks for clothing items are unique, which I actually just covered in a [blog post here](https://www.iregistertrademarks.com/clothing-trademark/).  Slapping a word or phrase on a shirt is called \"ornamental\" use, meaning that people are buying the product because they like what it says, not because they perceive the word/phrase as the *source* of the product.  That is why a label/tag/sticker with the brand name is necessary for it to be considered a *trademark* use.  You are also correct that registrations can be issued where the applicant only submits a photo of the front of the shirt, not a label/tag/sticker.  The reason is that these marks are going on the Supplemental Register, not the Principal Register.  Basically, this means that the registration owner does not get the broad protection that you get with most trademark registrations.  Instead, it reserves a spot at the Trademark Office where other people cannot register similar names for similar products.  If over time people start to recognize the word/phrase on the shirt as representing a brand, *then* the owner can apply again to get on the Principal Register.  So these registrations exist, but are mostly placeholders preventing the registration of similar marks.\n\nAs to your second question, I realize this might not be the most satisfying answer, but I encourage my clients to register their trademarks as a sort of \"insurance\" in case the big companies with deep pockets come after them.  If your registration is legitimate and you have priority, it makes it a lot more difficult for them to try and bully.  This is one of the best and cheapest deterrents for small businesses, because of course it's going to be next to impossible to compete $ for $ in expensive infringement litigation.",

If you have a checklist when starting a new business, this needs to be on there.\n\nI talk to business owners all the time that tell me that they know that their trademark isn't infringing on someone else's because \"nobody had the domain name\" or \"I did a Google search\" or that they looked at their Secretary of State's online corporation search.  Actually, that last one is a mistake that *practicing business attorneys* have told me they did for their clients to clear their trademarks, which I'm sure is malpractice.\n\nWhen coming up with your business name, product line name, slogan, or other trademark, a new business owner should do some basic research themselves, and then have a trademark attorney do a comprehensive federal search (through the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office) to make sure that someone does not already have rights to a confusingly similar trademark.\n\nAny business owner that hasn't done this needs to, regardless of how long they've been using their trademark.  Obviously, it's easier for a new business because they have not invested so much in marketing their brand and are more flexible with names.  Although registering your trademark with the USPTO is optimal, a trademark search is the bare minimum that every owner needs to do.\n\nIf you don't research your name, you risk investing in and growing your brand, only to get hit with a cease-and-desist and/or trademark infringement suit that requires you to change your name later on down the road, once it has gained substantial value to you and your business.",

If you have a checklist when starting a new business, this needs to be on there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talk to business owners all the time that tell me that they know that their trademark isn&amp;#39;t infringing on someone else&amp;#39;s because &amp;quot;nobody had the domain name&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I did a Google search&amp;quot; or that they looked at their Secretary of State&amp;#39;s online corporation search.  Actually, that last one is a mistake that &lt;em&gt;practicing business attorneys&lt;/em&gt; have told me they did for their clients to clear their trademarks, which I&amp;#39;m sure is malpractice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When coming up with your business name, product line name, slogan, or other trademark, a new business owner should do some basic research themselves, and then have a trademark attorney do a comprehensive federal search (through the U.S. Patent &amp;amp; Trademark Office) to make sure that someone does not already have rights to a confusingly similar trademark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any business owner that hasn&amp;#39;t done this needs to, regardless of how long they&amp;#39;ve been using their trademark.  Obviously, it&amp;#39;s easier for a new business because they have not invested so much in marketing their brand and are more flexible with names.  Although registering your trademark with the USPTO is optimal, a trademark search is the bare minimum that every owner needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t research your name, you risk investing in and growing your brand, only to get hit with a cease-and-desist and/or trademark infringement suit that requires you to change your name later on down the road, once it has gained substantial value to you and your business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I had a lot of experience with social media (being addicted for years) and also knew trademark law, so I applied and was hired.  I made a good impression so that when his firm grew to the point where a second attorney was needed, it made a lot of sense for me to join!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I stumbled by accident into my dream job.  I&amp;#39;m incredibly lucky, and try to keep that in mind constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Those are the ones you hear about that turn a few illegal song downloads into six- or seven-figure damages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you or anyone is really worried about protecting a particular work, they should talk to a copyright attorney about registration.  They can PM if they&amp;#39;re ever interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
