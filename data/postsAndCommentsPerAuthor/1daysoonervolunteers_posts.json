The ability to observe participants closely and gather samples while tracing the progress of infection in real time, knowing exactly when they were infected and with what dose, and being able to follow up over a long period, would offer an unprecedented level of scientific and medical insight into an unfamiliar virus. It would also help us test vaccines far faster. If a challenge trial brings us one day closer to the development of an additional vaccine that could avert just 25% of daily COVID-19 deaths, it would save 1,250 lives. If a challenge trial brings us a month closer, it’d save 37,500 lives.\n\nTo learn more about COVID-19 human challenge trials:\n\n* Watch this [Vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2fxJI_cP58)\n* Read this [piece](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/deliberately-infecting-volunteers-coronavirus-can-answer-vital/) by Dr. Sayantan Banerjee in The Telegraph\n* Read this [paper ](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa935/5868014)in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases\n\n# Why Is It Cost-Effective To Sign The Petition?\n\n**For one, it is remarkably easy (takes around 20 seconds), so even a very small chance that your signature makes a difference tips the scale in any cost-effectiveness calculation on the margin.**\n\nMore broadly, though, signaling a groundswell of public support for COVID-19 human challenge trials has directly led to faster preparation for these trials. In May, a NIH document [noted](https://www.ft.com/content/0e7f1aff-9323-4d82-93ff-bbc5c20514d0) that their consideration of challenge trials “has been driven almost entirely by the altruism of potential volunteer advocates and the intense considerations of bioethicists.”\n\n1Day Sooner, which has worked systematically to include volunteers in the public conversation about challenge trials, launched an [open letter](https://1daysooner.org/openletter) in support of COVID-19 challenge trials on July 15 that was signed by over 100 academics and experts as well as 2,000 potential challenge trial volunteers. A week later, the Washington Post Editorial Board [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-challenge/exclusive-u-s-to-make-coronavirus-strain-for-possible-human-challenge-trials-idUSKCN25A1EL) in favor of challenge trial preparation. Within a few weeks, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-challenge/exclusive-u-s-to-make-coronavirus-strain-for-possible-human-challenge-trials-idUSKCN25A1EL) that the National Institutes of Health were preparing a coronavirus strain for a COVID-19 challenge trial, in part due to “pressure from advocacy groups such as 1Day Sooner.”\n\nThe logic behind the effectiveness of public advocacy for challenge trials is that vaccine developers want assurance that their decision to deliberately infect people with a dangerous virus won’t prompt public backlash. By making clear that the public is actually on board with these trials, stakeholders have a safety net to move forward.\n\nWe are now launching a Canada (and, soon, UK petition campaign) because [Oxford’s Jenner Institute ](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/inside-oxford-s-push-for-challenge-trials-amid-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine-89676357631)and [several Canadian MPs ](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2020/08/24/it-is-worth-the-risk-to-accelerate-covid-19-vaccine-testing.html)have signaled[ ](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/16/coronavirus-vaccine-oxford-team-volunteers-lab-controlled-human-challenge-trial)interest[ ](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/16/coronavirus-vaccine-oxford-team-volunteers-lab-controlled-human-challenge-trial)in conducting a COVID-19 human challenge trial.

The ability to observe participants closely and gather samples while tracing the progress of infection in real time, knowing exactly when they were infected and with what dose, and being able to follow up over a long period, would offer an unprecedented level of scientific and medical insight into an unfamiliar virus. It would also help us test vaccines far faster. If a challenge trial brings us one day closer to the development of an additional vaccine that could avert just 25% of daily COVID-19 deaths, it would save 1,250 lives. If a challenge trial brings us a month closer, it’d save 37,500 lives. \n\n**Vulnerable and marginalized populations are suffering most during this pandemic. Getting a vaccine sooner would ameliorate the suffering of these populations disproportionately.** \n\nTo learn more about COVID-19 human challenge trials:\n\n* Watch this [Vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2fxJI_cP58)\n* Read this [piece](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/deliberately-infecting-volunteers-coronavirus-can-answer-vital/) by Dr. Sayantan Banerjee in The Telegraph\n* Read this [paper ](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa935/5868014)in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases\n\n# Why Is It Cost-Effective To Sign The Petition?\n\nFor one, it is remarkably easy (takes around 20 seconds), so even a very small chance that your signature makes a difference tips the scale in any cost-effectiveness calculation on the margin.\n\nMore broadly, though, signaling a groundswell of public support for COVID-19 human challenge trials has directly led to faster preparation for these trials. In May, a NIH document [noted](https://www.ft.com/content/0e7f1aff-9323-4d82-93ff-bbc5c20514d0) that their consideration of challenge trials “has been driven almost entirely by the altruism of potential volunteer advocates and the intense considerations of bioethicists.”\n\n1Day Sooner, which has worked systematically to include volunteers in the public conversation about challenge trials, launched an [open letter](https://1daysooner.org/openletter) in support of COVID-19 challenge trials on July 15 that was signed by over 100 academics and experts as well as 2,000 potential challenge trial volunteers. A week later, the Washington Post Editorial Board [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-challenge/exclusive-u-s-to-make-coronavirus-strain-for-possible-human-challenge-trials-idUSKCN25A1EL) in favor of challenge trial preparation. Within a few weeks, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-challenge/exclusive-u-s-to-make-coronavirus-strain-for-possible-human-challenge-trials-idUSKCN25A1EL) that the National Institutes of Health were preparing a coronavirus strain for a COVID-19 challenge trial, in part due to “pressure from advocacy groups such as 1Day Sooner.”\n\nThe logic behind the effectiveness of public advocacy for challenge trials is that vaccine developers want assurance that their decision to deliberately infect people with a dangerous virus won’t prompt public backlash. By making clear that the public is actually on board with these trials, stakeholders have a safety net to move forward.\n\nWe are now launching a Canada (and, soon, UK petition campaign) because [Oxford’s Jenner Institute ](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/inside-oxford-s-push-for-challenge-trials-amid-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine-89676357631)and [several Canadian MPs ](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2020/08/24/it-is-worth-the-risk-to-accelerate-covid-19-vaccine-testing.html)have signaled[ ](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/16/coronavirus-vaccine-oxford-team-volunteers-lab-controlled-human-challenge-trial)interest[ ](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/16/coronavirus-vaccine-oxford-team-volunteers-lab-controlled-human-challenge-trial)in conducting a COVID-19 human challenge trial.
