Not to be confused with Dollar 'Fight' Club...not supposed to talk about that anyway since that's rule #1 of fight club :)\n\nWe recently released an industry report about the future of the Airfare industry in the post coronavirus world. It's been widely covered by the press over the last couple of weeks and we've been getting tons of questions about it, so thought Reddit would be a great place to answer them. I'm relatively new to Reddit and excited to be here to share/discuss the future of travel post COVID-19 with everyone.\n\n**Background on Company:**\n\nWe help over 1 million members travel more and save $$$ on international and domestic flights. Dollar Flight Club has been around for more than 3 years and here's some proof that a few people find what we do and say useful :) Recent Media: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/future-travel-bookings-pandemic/index.html), [Conde Nast Traveler](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/what-to-consider-before-you-cancel-your-flight), [AFAR Magazine](https://www.afar.com/magazine/top-trending-destinations-with-the-best-airfares-deals-in-2020) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jqlouise/2019/11/01/dollar-flight-club-launches-business-and-first-class-deals/#34633aa363c2), [Fodors](https://www.fodors.com/news/photos/whats-flying-going-to-be-like-post-pandemic), and [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/news/dollar-flight-club-premium-plus/) to name a few.\n\nOur team focuses on international and domestic flight deals from and within the United States. We also serve international deals from departure airports in Europe, South America, and Australia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Proof it's me:** [https://twitter.com/DollarFlights/status/1258552639748370432](https://twitter.com/DollarFlights/status/1258552639748370432)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Industry Report:**\n\nLate last month, we put together detailed studies on the [COVID-19 impact on the airline industry and airfare prices](https://dollarflightclub.com/industry_reports/covid-19-impact-on-the-airfare-industry-in-2020-and-beyond/) based on data from post 9/11 and the Great Recession as well as the [Impact on Consumer Travel Demand](https://dollarflightclub.com/industry_reports/covid-19-impact-on-travel-demand-in-2020-and-into-the-future) where we surveyed 20,000 of our 1 million members.\n\nHere are some high-level takeaways:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Airfare prices will decrease by 35% on average through 2021 and then sharply increase 27% on average (above 2019 levels) through 2025 as demand rebounds.\n* Two major US carriers will merge in 2021, further consolidating control of the market.\n* Even though facing fewer flight options, travelers will benefit from less flight delays and cancellations.\n* Over 40% of travelers will only travel domestically through the end of 2020 due to the outbreak.\n* The #1 domestic destination for Christmas/NYE travel is Hawaii.\n* The #1 international destination for Christmas/NYE travel is Paris.\n* much more...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we get started, I want to make it clear that I'm definitely not here to condone travel until it's absolutely safe to do so. Rather, I'm here to discuss the future of travel or anything travel-related you have on your mind.\n\nI canâ€™t wait to answer your questions on the studies and discuss live with the help of my Dollar Flight Club team, starting around 10am PST!\n\nStay safe!\n\n\\-Jesse\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUICK UPDATE at 2pm PST! - Loving all these questions and comments coming in!
