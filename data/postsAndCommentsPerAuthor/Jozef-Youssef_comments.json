        "body": "Yes this will absolutely make chefs (even in fine dining) think more about delivery and â€˜at home dining experiencesâ€™. Delivery sector has disrupted restaurants in general, even before this current pandemic many higher end restaurants were trying to offer â€˜to-goâ€™ options. After quarantine restaurants may have to space out tables more, so less covers - again delivery would help overcome this financially. Also if delivery makes up a big part of your revenue, do you need a high rent premium location? Delivery (especially of fine dining) will have better margins too.\n\nI think this pandemic has clearly shown just what a hand to mouth business restaurants are in, and that they are financially insecure. Some will bounce back, but I think we will see simpler, smaller menus and cut back opening hours in the beginning as they wonâ€™t be able to afford to re-hire a full team initially.\n\nHospitality business models have needed a shake up for a while, this will definitely have a lasting impact.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes this will absolutely make chefs (even in fine dining) think more about delivery and â€˜at home dining experiencesâ€™. Delivery sector has disrupted restaurants in general, even before this current pandemic many higher end restaurants were trying to offer â€˜to-goâ€™ options. After quarantine restaurants may have to space out tables more, so less covers - again delivery would help overcome this financially. Also if delivery makes up a big part of your revenue, do you need a high rent premium location? Delivery (especially of fine dining) will have better margins too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this pandemic has clearly shown just what a hand to mouth business restaurants are in, and that they are financially insecure. Some will bounce back, but I think we will see simpler, smaller menus and cut back opening hours in the beginning as they wonâ€™t be able to afford to re-hire a full team initially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hospitality business models have needed a shake up for a while, this will definitely have a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
