My understanding of the sequencer knobs was that they only affect the VCO note if the Osc button in the Seq 1 Assign section is lit, though? I can hear the note change in pitch when turning that button on and off. I will have to test to see if the sequencer knob positions have an effect on the VCO even when the button is unlit/off for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have also found that &amp;#39;out of the box&amp;#39;, the oscillators were 10-13% out of tune (tho VCO1 and VCO2 equally so relative to one another).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did the global fine-tune adjustment described in that part of the manual, and they&amp;#39;re now far better (+/- 0.5%) across their range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if i should be concerned that the &amp;#39;base&amp;#39; tuning was off or not, but it seems to have been easily addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the oscillators were badly out of tune with one another, i think that would be a sign of a bigger problem&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It was never intended to be the company name, but as time passed we just ended up adopting it because it turned out from market-testing that people responded well to it.\n\nAs for pronunciation: it is controversial even internally.

It was an acronym standing for, &amp;quot;A Bit Is Not Enough&amp;quot;  (as in, &amp;#39;a little privacy is not good enough&amp;#39;).  It was never intended to be the company name, but as time passed we just ended up adopting it because it turned out from market-testing that people responded well to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for pronunciation: it is controversial even internally. (lol) We may have begun saying, &amp;quot;Uh-been&amp;quot; when it was just an acronym, but as time passed we noted that 80% of customers referred to it as &amp;quot;ey-bine&amp;quot;, and so that&amp;#39;s the common pronunciation at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t talk about the spiders for NDA reasons.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

IMSI related city-phone surveillance will gain from 5G and things like ClearView are being combined with Ring neighborhood surveillance-sharing.  In the last few months, we’ve seen contact tracing tech spring up for COVID and some questionable practices around black lives matter demonstrations as well.  All of us that are concerned - including DeleteMe - need to continue to donate to the EFF and other transparency organizations.  I am not optimistic here, long-term. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

MSI actually lists the bios version on their website as Year/month/day, but the release date and the 'bios date' are always a few days off (one is when the bios was finished, the other was 'release date)\n\nBut that's from Sept 5th, not May 9th\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\&gt; \" this dram frequency its not the same as ddr speed is it? \"\n\nWhen you update the BIOS it resets all your settings back to \"default\". In other words, you need to go back into the BIOS and enable the XMP profile again.  That reading you're seeing is 1/2 of 2133, which is the stock DDR4 speed.  When you re-enable the XMP profile, it should read 1600 (1/2 of the rate)\n\nIn general, memory compatibility/tune-ability improves with newer BIOSes, so if you ever plan to overclock the memory, its better to have the newest BIOS.  I wasn't able to get 3600 C16 until the most recent beta-bios; before, i just ran the XMP profile.",

Most PC companies do &amp;#39;American style&amp;#39; dates which are Month/Day/Year.   MSI actually lists the bios version on their website as Year/month/day, but the release date and the &amp;#39;bios date&amp;#39; are always a few days off (one is when the bios was finished, the other was &amp;#39;release date)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s from Sept 5th, not May 9th&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot; this dram frequency its not the same as ddr speed is it? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you update the BIOS it resets all your settings back to &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;. In other words, you need to go back into the BIOS and enable the XMP profile again.  That reading you&amp;#39;re seeing is 1/2 of 2133, which is the stock DDR4 speed.  When you re-enable the XMP profile, it should read 1600 (1/2 of the rate)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, memory compatibility/tune-ability improves with newer BIOSes, so if you ever plan to overclock the memory, its better to have the newest BIOS.  I wasn&amp;#39;t able to get 3600 C16 until the most recent beta-bios; before, i just ran the XMP profile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Still a problem, but imo the fact the vast bulk are only 25mhz short makes me think its probably a shortcoming that software improvements can help address, and that streamlining will eventually get most close enough to advertised spec.\n\n3900x, less so, because the shortfall seems spread over a far wider range.\n\nI hope the board doesn't devolve into 'class action' shrieking, but i do think complaints are entirely justified.",

Still a problem, but imo the fact the vast bulk are only 25mhz short makes me think its probably a shortcoming that software improvements can help address, and that streamlining will eventually get most close enough to advertised spec.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3900x, less so, because the shortfall seems spread over a far wider range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope the board doesn&amp;#39;t devolve into &amp;#39;class action&amp;#39; shrieking, but i do think complaints are entirely justified.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I'm assuming its something about the chip no longer liking the memory settings.\n\nI'm probably going to roll back to [1.0.0.3](https://1.0.0.3/) ABBA because same memory settings ran fine w/ that. Will probably also backdate the Nvidia drivers to early Nov. But am just curious if anyone else has seen funky behavior in the last few weeks.\n\nSpecs:\n\n**Motherboard:** MSI X470 Gaming Pro Carbon  \n**CPU:** 3700x  \n**Memory:** 16GB Hynix CJR 3200 oc'd to 3600  \n**GPU:** Nvidia 2060 super  \n**VBIOS:**  90.06.44.80.21  \n**Driver:**  441.66  \n**OS:** Windows 10 Pro (1903) x64",

        "body": "I've been meaning to ask someone some questions the next time this topic came up...\n\nbut i've done some memory OC'ing for the first time w/ Ryzen 3000, and its been reasonably productive\n\n16gb Patriot Viper RGB (Hynix CJR) rated @ 3200 16-18-18-36, currently running @ 3600 16-19-20-32, using the DRAM calculator numbers w/ the default v1 XMP profile, and \"FAST\" timings option (main differences are disabled GDM, lower tRFC, tRAS, tRC)  I also then additionally lowered  tRRDS tRRDL tFAW  to 4/6/16 from 6/8/24\n\nLatency went from like 75 to 68, and read-speeds went from 46000 mb/s to 52000 mb/s (which seems the low end of the theoretical bandwidth, but its the best i get w/ these settings)\n\nWhen i used the manual profile it only offered the \"SAFE\" timings, and improvement was more lackluster\n\nMy question is basically about: \"Diminishing returns\" -\n\nwhen i run the same kit @ 3800 16-21-22-38, which it seems to do just fine, was stable w/ an hour or so of Memtest86... latency and bandwidth actually worsened.\n\nI found the same basic thing running @ 3733; tho i didn't spend as much time tweaking subtimings on these faster speeds, i just ran w/ what DRAM calculator gave me.\n\nbasically, 3600c16, plus some tightening of timings?  seems to be where this kit peaks, but then adding further clock speed seems to just hit a brick wall.\n\nIs this just a limitation of the kit, or am i maybe doing something wrong? I'd have thought there would be some benefit to running @ 1900 Fclk and 3800 DRAM, even w/ looser timings, but it seems to have no effect.\n\nI'm not sure if I should stop @ the 3600 \"Fast\" settings the DRAM calc provides (plus the minor improvements in subtimings), or whether i should start trying to lower the CL # to 15/14?  \n\nAny thoughts appreciated.",

I&amp;#39;d have thought there would be some benefit to running @ 1900 Fclk and 3800 DRAM, even w/ looser timings, but it seems to have no effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if I should stop @ the 3600 &amp;quot;Fast&amp;quot; settings the DRAM calc provides (plus the minor improvements in subtimings), or whether i should start trying to lower the CL # to 15/14?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
