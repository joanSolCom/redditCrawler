This happened because they once again again failed to propose a vision for fixing America's biggest problems. It's not about left vs. right. It's about proposing solutions vs. political posturing.\n\n**Proof:** [https://twitter.com/zackexley/status/1324425418397655040](https://twitter.com/zackexley/status/1324425418397655040)\n\n**Short bio:** I co-founded Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, best known for electing non-politician leaders such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush and many others. The idea was to replace every corrupt and complicit member of the U.S. Congress with a slate of honest and visionary non-politician leaders. They do amazing work but I'm not currently involved with either organization and am not speaking for them here. (Rachel Lears [made a movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wGZc8ZjFY4) about part of it called Knock Down the House which you can watch on Netflix or YouTube.) Before that, I served on the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, where [I helped create and lead the program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) that mobilized hundreds of thousands of volunteers all around the country. A long time ago, I did things like organize [the first flash mobs](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/12/organizing-online/) before anyone had a name for that, make the first political parody site on the Internet which made George W Bush [call me a “garbage man” and declare “there ought to be limits to freedom,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/29/002r-112999-idx.html)\" and develop some of the first tools for online organizing, community-building and fundraising. I was the first organizing director at [MoveOn.org](https://MoveOn.org) when we were trying to prevent the Iraq War, and brought our tools and techniques into presidential politics with the Dean and Kerry campaigns.",
