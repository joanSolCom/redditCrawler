Similar to the 7 comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before Dynamite explodes. Let’s not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods blow a fuse as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.\n\nThe way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through ***M E G A T H R E A D S***. Soon there’ll be a decent amount of content popping in, so before submitting anything, please make sure it’s not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Don’t make papa cry.\n\nThe megathreads we’re planning to have are:\n\n---\n\n#I. Dynamite Comeback Hype Thread  \n\nThis is where you go with your **strong feelings**. This thread will be posted 12 hours before the release. A free-for-all thread to explode with pre-release hype and blow out your immediate post-release emotion dump.\n\n---\n\n#II. Dynamite Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Song Discussion Megathread\n\nThis thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream Dynamite (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for). \n\nWe’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need your help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible!  \n\nThis thread is also to be used for general discussion of the song. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.**   \n\n\n---\n\n#III. Dynamite Achievements Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/), [HER Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/), [7 Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/f77g2i/7_achievements_megathread/).  \n\n---\n\n#IV. Dynamite Radio Play Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [HER Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/), [7 Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/f77g2y/7_radio_play_megathread/)  \n\n---\n\n#V. Dynamite English Press Coverage Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. \n\n**Important Note:** If it’s from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don’t have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    \n\n---\n\n#VI. Dynamite SNS Mentions Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc.  \n\n**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone really notable, like Michelle Obama, tweets about BTS, that tweet can have its own thread. (Come through this time, M.)  Also, artists who featured on the release can have their own posts. If they spam their SNS multiple times, please be kind and make a compilation.\n\n**Important Note II:** BTS’ tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).\n\n\n---\n\n#VII. Compilation Redirect Gigathread  \n\nThe behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  \n\n--- \n\n\n#VIII. Discord Server  \n\nDon’t forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.  You can get a better feel of how Discord works in [this beautiful, sexy tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTaBiaydaiSjv1At5VwSdL9Ko-NZTLSgfueYqeRcSpnAu3cADtgKhYR72dxSHyU8wEffTpRyg3driOS/pub?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=60000) written by your handsome Tech Support Person™.\n\nYou can request an invite [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord).\n\n[Join us for fun times!](https://i.imgur.com/FcfsmKM.gifv)\n\n--- \n\nThese threads are going to be manually posted by your favorite internet janitors, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 🔫 \n\nIf we notice any other type of content drowning the sub, we’ll dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for god’s sake, please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content! \n\nIt’s almost time to board [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png) once again – hold hands with a priest and pray death away!\n\nCheers,\n\nThe /r/bangtan Mod Team.\n\n[](#aaa)",

Similar to the 7 comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before Dynamite explodes. Let’s not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods blow a fuse as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;M E G A T H R E A D S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Soon there’ll be a decent amount of content popping in, so before submitting anything, please make sure it’s not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Don’t make papa cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The megathreads we’re planning to have are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;I. Dynamite Comeback Hype Thread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where you go with your &lt;strong&gt;strong feelings&lt;/strong&gt;. This thread will be posted 12 hours before the release. A free-for-all thread to explode with pre-release hype and blow out your immediate post-release emotion dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;II. Dynamite Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Song Discussion Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream Dynamite (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need your help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is also to be used for general discussion of the song. &lt;strong&gt;Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;III. Dynamite Achievements Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/\"&gt;WINGS Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;YNWA Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;HER Achievements Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/f77g2i/7_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;7 Achievements Megathread&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IV.

This is a reminder that **this is against the sub rules for [Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_a3._piracy_and_leaks)** and repeated violation of this rule will lead to us **banning you from participating on the sub.**\n\n\n##What is paid content?\n\nAny image or video that is from a source you would not have access to unless you pay for it or exclusive content.  This would include, but is not limited to:\n\n* DVD rips\n* V App+ content\n* Photobook scans/Photocard scans\n* Bon Voyage episodes\n* Movies or series\n* Weverse Members only section\n\n**Daum/Japan/Weverse Artist sections and images/videos from BTS World are also included in content that must not be posted.**\n\n**WE BEG OF YOU:** Please check your images or videos before posting them if they are from paid content.\n\nJust because you got them for free off Google, Pinterest, Tumblr or Twitter that does not mean that it isn’t from paid content. Posting these on a public forum without consent from BTS, BigHit or an involved third party is illegal.  \n\nThis will save you and us time and effort of removing them and you having to hunt for another photo for a collective r/heungtan uwu.\n\nYou know how some BTS images/clips keep you up at night? They keep us up at night, too! Between all the mods, it is highly likely that we remember where a video or image is from and if it is from paid content... but please don’t test our knowledge.  We will remove any posts/comments containing such content.\n\nGoogle and reverse image searches exist.  Just plug in that “Yoongi with light blue floral shirt with some leaves blonde hair under black fedora cute smile” on the search bar and maybe you’ll find out that it is from Summer Package 2017 DVD.\n\nWe all wanna have fun! So let’s keep it clean!  Please don’t get your accounts in [trouble](https://youtu.be/yoW3YcldxQs), we cannot bail you out of jail! Mods poor.\n\nThank you!!!",

Similar to the Persona comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before everything drops. Let’s not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods weeping as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.\n\nThe way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through ***M E G A T H R E A D S***. Soon there’ll be a decent amount of content flooding in, so before submitting anything, please make sure it’s not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Don’t make papa cry.\n\nThe megathreads we’re planning to have are:\n\n---\n\n#I. Map of the Soul: 7 Comeback Hype Thread  \n\nThis is where you go with your **strong feelings**. This thread will be posted about seven hours before the release. A free-for-all thread for pre-release hype and immediate post-release emotion dump.\n\n---\n\n#II. 7 Achievements Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/), [HER Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/).  \n\n---\n\n#III. 7 Theories Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [YNWA Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tmifx/ynwa_theories_megathread/), [Love Yourself Teaser/Films Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6tut7y/love_yourself_teasersfilms_theory_megathread/), [HER Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmhu/love_yourself_herdna_theory_thread/)].\n\n---\n\n#IV. 7 Radio Play Megathread  \n\n**See past example:** [HER Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/)\n\n---\n\n#V. 7 English Press Coverage Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. \n\n**Important Note:** If it’s from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don’t have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    \n\n---\n\n#VI. 7 SNS Mentions Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  \n\n**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread (Come through this time, B.)  \n\n**Important Note II:** BTS’ tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).\n\n--- \n\n#VII. 7 - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread  \n\nThis thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream 7 (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. \n\nWe’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys’ help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  \n\nThis thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.**   \n\n---\n\n#VIII. Music Show Voting Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [YNWA Music Show Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/), [HER Music Show Megathread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/).   \n\n---\n\n#IX. Compilation Redirect Gigathread  \n\nThe behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  \n\n--- \n\n\n##X. Discord Server  \n\nDon’t forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.  You can get a better feel of how Discord works in [this beautiful, sexy tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTaBiaydaiSjv1At5VwSdL9Ko-NZTLSgfueYqeRcSpnAu3cADtgKhYR72dxSHyU8wEffTpRyg3driOS/pub?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=60000) written by your handsome Tech Support Person™.\n\nYou can request an invite [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord).\n\n[Join us for fun times!](https://i.imgur.com/FcfsmKM.gifv)\n\n--- \n\nThese threads are going to be manually posted by your truly ravishing, modest mods *(weeps)*, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 🔫 \n\nIf we notice any other one type of content drowning the sub, we’ll dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for god’s sake, please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content! \n\nIt’s almost time to board [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png) once again – hold hands with a priest and pray death away!\n\nCheers,\n\nThe /r/bangtan Mod Team.\n\n[](#v_heart)",

A free-for-all thread for pre-release hype and immediate post-release emotion dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;II. 7 Achievements Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/\"&gt;WINGS Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;YNWA Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;HER Achievements Megathread&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;III. 7 Theories Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tmifx/ynwa_theories_megathread/\"&gt;YNWA Theories Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6tut7y/love_yourself_teasersfilms_theory_megathread/\"&gt;Love Yourself Teaser/Films Theories Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmhu/love_yourself_herdna_theory_thread/\"&gt;HER Theories Megathread&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IV. 7 Radio Play Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/\"&gt;HER Radio Play Megathread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;V. 7 English Press Coverage Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s from a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don’t have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VI. 7 SNS Mentions Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread (Come through this time, B.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note II:&lt;/strong&gt; BTS’ tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be &lt;em&gt;compiled into one self-post compilation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/\"&gt;like so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VII. 7 - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream 7 (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys’ help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. &lt;strong&gt;Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VIII. Music Show Voting Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/\"&gt;YNWA Music Show Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/\"&gt;HER Music Show Megathread!&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IX. Compilation Redirect Gigathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be &lt;strong&gt;stickied&lt;/strong&gt; and contain links to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;X. Discord Server&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.

Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 🔫 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we notice any other one type of content drowning the sub, we’ll dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for god’s sake, please remember that &lt;strong&gt;compilations are always better than individual submissions&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to a batch of similar content! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s almost time to board &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png\"&gt;the hype train&lt;/a&gt; once again – hold hands with a priest and pray death away!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"/r/bangtan\"&gt;/r/bangtan&lt;/a&gt; Mod Team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"#v_heart\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Similar to the 7 comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before Dynamite explodes. Let’s not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods blow a fuse as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.\n\nThe way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through ***M E G A T H R E A D S***. Soon there’ll be a decent amount of content popping in, so before submitting anything, please make sure it’s not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Don’t make papa cry.\n\nThe megathreads we’re planning to have are:\n\n---\n\n#I. Dynamite Comeback Hype Thread  \n\nThis is where you go with your **strong feelings**. This thread will be posted 12 hours before the release. A free-for-all thread to explode with pre-release hype and blow out your immediate post-release emotion dump.\n\n---\n\n#II. Dynamite Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Song Discussion Megathread\n\nThis thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream Dynamite (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for). \n\nWe’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need your help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible!  \n\nThis thread is also to be used for general discussion of the song. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.**   \n\n\n---\n\n#III. Dynamite Achievements Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/), [HER Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/), [7 Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/f77g2i/7_achievements_megathread/).  \n\n---\n\n#IV. Dynamite Radio Play Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [HER Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/), [7 Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/f77g2y/7_radio_play_megathread/)  \n\n---\n\n#V. Dynamite English Press Coverage Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. \n\n**Important Note:** If it’s from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don’t have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    \n\n---\n\n#VI. Dynamite SNS Mentions Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc.  \n\n**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone really notable, like Michelle Obama, tweets about BTS, that tweet can have its own thread. (Come through this time, M.)  Also, artists who featured on the release can have their own posts. If they spam their SNS multiple times, please be kind and make a compilation.\n\n**Important Note II:** BTS’ tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).\n\n\n---\n\n#VII. Compilation Redirect Gigathread  \n\nThe behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  \n\n--- \n\n\n#VIII. Discord Server  \n\nDon’t forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.  You can get a better feel of how Discord works in [this beautiful, sexy tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTaBiaydaiSjv1At5VwSdL9Ko-NZTLSgfueYqeRcSpnAu3cADtgKhYR72dxSHyU8wEffTpRyg3driOS/pub?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=60000) written by your handsome Tech Support Person™.\n\nYou can request an invite [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord).\n\n[Join us for fun times!](https://i.imgur.com/FcfsmKM.gifv)\n\n--- \n\nThese threads are going to be manually posted by your favorite internet janitors, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 🔫 \n\nIf we notice any other type of content drowning the sub, we’ll dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for god’s sake, please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content! \n\nIt’s almost time to board [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png) once again – hold hands with a priest and pray death away!\n\nCheers,\n\nThe /r/bangtan Mod Team.\n\n[](#aaa)",

Similar to the 7 comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before Dynamite explodes. Let’s not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods blow a fuse as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;M E G A T H R E A D S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Soon there’ll be a decent amount of content popping in, so before submitting anything, please make sure it’s not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Don’t make papa cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The megathreads we’re planning to have are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;I. Dynamite Comeback Hype Thread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where you go with your &lt;strong&gt;strong feelings&lt;/strong&gt;. This thread will be posted 12 hours before the release. A free-for-all thread to explode with pre-release hype and blow out your immediate post-release emotion dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;II. Dynamite Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Song Discussion Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream Dynamite (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need your help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is also to be used for general discussion of the song. &lt;strong&gt;Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;III. Dynamite Achievements Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/\"&gt;WINGS Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;YNWA Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;HER Achievements Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/f77g2i/7_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;7 Achievements Megathread&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IV.

This is a reminder that **this is against the sub rules for [Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_a3._piracy_and_leaks)** and repeated violation of this rule will lead to us **banning you from participating on the sub.**\n\n\n##What is paid content?\n\nAny image or video that is from a source you would not have access to unless you pay for it or exclusive content.  This would include, but is not limited to:\n\n* DVD rips\n* V App+ content\n* Photobook scans/Photocard scans\n* Bon Voyage episodes\n* Movies or series\n* Weverse Members only section\n\n**Daum/Japan/Weverse Artist sections and images/videos from BTS World are also included in content that must not be posted.**\n\n**WE BEG OF YOU:** Please check your images or videos before posting them if they are from paid content.\n\nJust because you got them for free off Google, Pinterest, Tumblr or Twitter that does not mean that it isn’t from paid content. Posting these on a public forum without consent from BTS, BigHit or an involved third party is illegal.  \n\nThis will save you and us time and effort of removing them and you having to hunt for another photo for a collective r/heungtan uwu.\n\nYou know how some BTS images/clips keep you up at night? They keep us up at night, too! Between all the mods, it is highly likely that we remember where a video or image is from and if it is from paid content... but please don’t test our knowledge.  We will remove any posts/comments containing such content.\n\nGoogle and reverse image searches exist.  Just plug in that “Yoongi with light blue floral shirt with some leaves blonde hair under black fedora cute smile” on the search bar and maybe you’ll find out that it is from Summer Package 2017 DVD.\n\nWe all wanna have fun! So let’s keep it clean!  Please don’t get your accounts in [trouble](https://youtu.be/yoW3YcldxQs), we cannot bail you out of jail! Mods poor.\n\nThank you!!!",

Similar to the Persona comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before everything drops. Let’s not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods weeping as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.\n\nThe way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through ***M E G A T H R E A D S***. Soon there’ll be a decent amount of content flooding in, so before submitting anything, please make sure it’s not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Don’t make papa cry.\n\nThe megathreads we’re planning to have are:\n\n---\n\n#I. Map of the Soul: 7 Comeback Hype Thread  \n\nThis is where you go with your **strong feelings**. This thread will be posted about seven hours before the release. A free-for-all thread for pre-release hype and immediate post-release emotion dump.\n\n---\n\n#II. 7 Achievements Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/), [HER Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/).  \n\n---\n\n#III. 7 Theories Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [YNWA Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tmifx/ynwa_theories_megathread/), [Love Yourself Teaser/Films Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6tut7y/love_yourself_teasersfilms_theory_megathread/), [HER Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmhu/love_yourself_herdna_theory_thread/)].\n\n---\n\n#IV. 7 Radio Play Megathread  \n\n**See past example:** [HER Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/)\n\n---\n\n#V. 7 English Press Coverage Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. \n\n**Important Note:** If it’s from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don’t have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    \n\n---\n\n#VI. 7 SNS Mentions Megathread  \n\nHere is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  \n\n**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread (Come through this time, B.)  \n\n**Important Note II:** BTS’ tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).\n\n--- \n\n#VII. 7 - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread  \n\nThis thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream 7 (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. \n\nWe’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys’ help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  \n\nThis thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.**   \n\n---\n\n#VIII. Music Show Voting Megathread  \n\n**See past examples:** [YNWA Music Show Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/), [HER Music Show Megathread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/).   \n\n---\n\n#IX. Compilation Redirect Gigathread  \n\nThe behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  \n\n--- \n\n\n##X. Discord Server  \n\nDon’t forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.  You can get a better feel of how Discord works in [this beautiful, sexy tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTaBiaydaiSjv1At5VwSdL9Ko-NZTLSgfueYqeRcSpnAu3cADtgKhYR72dxSHyU8wEffTpRyg3driOS/pub?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=60000) written by your handsome Tech Support Person™.\n\nYou can request an invite [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord).\n\n[Join us for fun times!](https://i.imgur.com/FcfsmKM.gifv)\n\n--- \n\nThese threads are going to be manually posted by your truly ravishing, modest mods *(weeps)*, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 🔫 \n\nIf we notice any other one type of content drowning the sub, we’ll dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for god’s sake, please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content! \n\nIt’s almost time to board [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png) once again – hold hands with a priest and pray death away!\n\nCheers,\n\nThe /r/bangtan Mod Team.\n\n[](#v_heart)",

A free-for-all thread for pre-release hype and immediate post-release emotion dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;II. 7 Achievements Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/\"&gt;WINGS Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;YNWA Achievement Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/\"&gt;HER Achievements Megathread&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;III. 7 Theories Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tmifx/ynwa_theories_megathread/\"&gt;YNWA Theories Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6tut7y/love_yourself_teasersfilms_theory_megathread/\"&gt;Love Yourself Teaser/Films Theories Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmhu/love_yourself_herdna_theory_thread/\"&gt;HER Theories Megathread&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IV. 7 Radio Play Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/\"&gt;HER Radio Play Megathread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;V. 7 English Press Coverage Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s from a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don’t have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VI. 7 SNS Mentions Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread (Come through this time, B.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note II:&lt;/strong&gt; BTS’ tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be &lt;em&gt;compiled into one self-post compilation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/\"&gt;like so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VII. 7 - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream 7 (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys’ help to tell us since we don’t know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. &lt;strong&gt;Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it’s for more thoughtful discussion.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VIII. Music Show Voting Megathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See past examples:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/\"&gt;YNWA Music Show Megathread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/\"&gt;HER Music Show Megathread!&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IX. Compilation Redirect Gigathread&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be &lt;strong&gt;stickied&lt;/strong&gt; and contain links to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;X. Discord Server&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.

Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 🔫 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we notice any other one type of content drowning the sub, we’ll dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for god’s sake, please remember that &lt;strong&gt;compilations are always better than individual submissions&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to a batch of similar content! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s almost time to board &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png\"&gt;the hype train&lt;/a&gt; once again – hold hands with a priest and pray death away!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"/r/bangtan\"&gt;/r/bangtan&lt;/a&gt; Mod Team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"#v_heart\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
