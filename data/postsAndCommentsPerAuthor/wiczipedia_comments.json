        "body": "The first tenet of any counter disinformation policy \\*needs\\* to be that disinformation is a threat to democracy, no matter whether it's foreign or domestic in its source. In the US right now, everyone agrees that foreign disinformation is bad but some are a bit more reticient when it comes to domestic disinfo. This is a mistake! It creates far too many loopholes for bad actors to exploit, and indeed, we're seeing adversaries like Russia begin to launder their narratives through authentic local voices. So we need to recognize that first. \n\nThen I'd like to see a lot more transparency- over algorithms, group and page ownership, microtargeting, and all advertising. People need to understand how and why information is making its way to them.\n\nFinally, we need oversight- there needs to be a federal watchdog that is ensuring the platforms are adhering to the laws they are subject to, not impinging upon freedom of expression, and ensuring equal access and safety on their platforms. \n\nWhat's the hold up? Well, right now there's an incentive to create online disinformation because we don't have any of the mechanisms I described above to keep it in check. Some political candidates have taken pledges not to engage in it, but they're now at a disadvantage, because their competitors have not. We need to level out that playing field with regulation. But less understandably, this issue has become politicized, even though it should absolutely be nonpartisan, so some politicians are afraid to speak up for democratic discourse, particularly relating to domestic disinformation.

In the US right now, everyone agrees that foreign disinformation is bad but some are a bit more reticient when it comes to domestic disinfo. This is a mistake! It creates far too many loopholes for bad actors to exploit, and indeed, we&amp;#39;re seeing adversaries like Russia begin to launder their narratives through authentic local voices. So we need to recognize that first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;d like to see a lot more transparency- over algorithms, group and page ownership, microtargeting, and all advertising. People need to understand how and why information is making its way to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need oversight- there needs to be a federal watchdog that is ensuring the platforms are adhering to the laws they are subject to, not impinging upon freedom of expression, and ensuring equal access and safety on their platforms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the hold up? Well, right now there&amp;#39;s an incentive to create online disinformation because we don&amp;#39;t have any of the mechanisms I described above to keep it in check. Some political candidates have taken pledges not to engage in it, but they&amp;#39;re now at a disadvantage, because their competitors have not.

It had a huge impact in Russian interference in Estonia in 2007 when Russian-language media exacerbated the grievances of the ethnic Russian population that led to riots, and in Georgia in 2008, when the Russian state media and international propaganda networks sought to counter the Georgian government's narrative about the five-day war.\n\nEffectiveness, whether we're talking about social or traditional media, is a hard thing to measure. Most people want to know if these efforts changed votes, but I think that's the wrong question. The goal isn't necessarily to change votes, but to change thinking and discourse, and there is certainly evidence of that in both of those cases and in the 2016 election in the United States.",

It had a huge impact in Russian interference in Estonia in 2007 when Russian-language media exacerbated the grievances of the ethnic Russian population that led to riots, and in Georgia in 2008, when the Russian state media and international propaganda networks sought to counter the Georgian government&amp;#39;s narrative about the five-day war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness, whether we&amp;#39;re talking about social or traditional media, is a hard thing to measure. Most people want to know if these efforts changed votes, but I think that&amp;#39;s the wrong question. The goal isn&amp;#39;t necessarily to change votes, but to change thinking and discourse, and there is certainly evidence of that in both of those cases and in the 2016 election in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
