But I&amp;#39;d add two things (my opinion, of course):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- being an illegal industry means it has to be hidden in wilder areas and when it&amp;#39;s discovered, the chemicals that the Colombian military spray on the area to kill the plants are even worse. So banning cocaine has turned it into a much bigger environmental problem than it otherwise may have been so the blame lies more with the lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I think cocaine gets singled out because it&amp;#39;s drugs and drugs are naughty. Something like palm oil wrecks far more havoc in Southeast Asia but for some reason we attach a moral value to coke which we don&amp;#39;t for shampoo. Oh well. Goodbye, orangutans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

They also control a big chunk of Europe's cocaine market, but the same can be said of Moroccans, Albanians, Nigerians, etc (there's an 80% figure flouting around, but how can anyone know exactly how much illegal goods are sold by who?)\n\nThere's no \"Russian mafia\" in the Italian sense of the word. There's gangs, crooked police, vory-v-zakone, shady businessmen, Tajik drug runners, etc. but all the big, loud crime syndicates who were dropping bodies 20-30 years ago have either been broken up, gone legit or been absorbed into the government's pyramid of corruption.

They&amp;#39;re also the most dominant OC group in the States. It&amp;#39;s not the 70s anymore, the Italian mob is pretty much dead. I doubt the guys they have left have any pull outside white working-class areas like in the hood; the Mexicans, however, supply those guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the &amp;#39;Ndrangheta from Calabria have got the most political clout in Italy and maybe Western Europe. They also control a big chunk of Europe&amp;#39;s cocaine market, but the same can be said of Moroccans, Albanians, Nigerians, etc (there&amp;#39;s an 80% figure flouting around, but how can anyone know exactly how much illegal goods are sold by who?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;Russian mafia&amp;quot; in the Italian sense of the word. There&amp;#39;s gangs, crooked police, vory-v-zakone, shady businessmen, Tajik drug runners, etc. but all the big, loud crime syndicates who were dropping bodies 20-30 years ago have either been broken up, gone legit or been absorbed into the government&amp;#39;s pyramid of corruption. In that sense I guess the Russian/ex-Soviet mafia is the most powerful because they cover 1/6th of the Earth&amp;#39;s surface and they&amp;#39;re so close to the ruling elites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Where it gets dangerous is when you're buying it off a dude on the Stringer Bell side of town, you don't know what's in it, you don't know the quality... *that's* how people die. \n\nLikewise MDMA is fairly safe in normal doses. Cocaine and alcohol though both degrade your health and can make you act like a dick.\n\nI think there's some folks out there that seriously downplay the less groovy effects of weed, that you can't get addicted to it, or they say it can cure cancer or some shit. I get it, there's been a lot of propaganda and fearmongering over the years, but it is what it is.",

Where it gets dangerous is when you&amp;#39;re buying it off a dude on the Stringer Bell side of town, you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s in it, you don&amp;#39;t know the quality... &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; how people die. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise MDMA is fairly safe in normal doses. Cocaine and alcohol though both degrade your health and can make you act like a dick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s some folks out there that seriously downplay the less groovy effects of weed, that you can&amp;#39;t get addicted to it, or they say it can cure cancer or some shit.

He had a little bullet hanging off the zipper of his backpack.&lt;br/&gt;\nHe told us some interesting things about the relationship he has with his bosses and the real nature of the &amp;#39;war on drugs&amp;#39; in the Philippines....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That happens too but 99% of the time it's just boring and depressing. And that, I think, can go to your head. When you're locked in a cell you've got the same negative thoughts going round and round your mind and no way to break out (physically or mentally). The year I was inside the number of suicides jumped massively because of staff cutbacks across the prison system so we'd be in our cells up to  23½ hours a day. The guards were predicting riots and sure enough not long after I left there were three in a row (Bedford, Lewes and Birmingham, if I remember).  I dunno if it's got better since.",

British prison movie is Starred Up) where someone gets shanked in the showers every five minutes. That happens too but 99% of the time it&amp;#39;s just boring and depressing. And that, I think, can go to your head. When you&amp;#39;re locked in a cell you&amp;#39;ve got the same negative thoughts going round and round your mind and no way to break out (physically or mentally). The year I was inside the number of suicides jumped massively because of staff cutbacks across the prison system so we&amp;#39;d be in our cells up to  23½ hours a day. The guards were predicting riots and sure enough not long after I left there were three in a row (Bedford, Lewes and Birmingham, if I remember).  I dunno if it&amp;#39;s got better since.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "In terms of privately-owned firearms helping overthrow oppressive regimes, it depends what your definition of \"oppressive\" is. \n\nThe example that springs to mind is the Black Panthers, a black militant group founded in Oakland, California, in the 60s, that used open carry laws to patrol black neighborhoods watching out for corrupt or brutal cops. How much the Panthers actually did for the cause is up for debate - they certainly left an impression - but one consequence of what they called 'copwatching' was it led to the NRA actually backing gun control laws in California (the Mulford Act, 1967) which barred open carry and signed by none other than Ronald Reagan.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fpk6P4kOqE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fpk6P4kOqE) \n\nThere are few countries with gun cultures similiar to the States (Pakistan, maybe?), and in the last century or so the weapons used in uprisings, civil wars, etc. usually come from deserters, foreign backers, raided military or police armouries, underworld traffickers and so on. But in my view, the argument certain anti-gun advocates (I'm neutral; not American; don't care) make when they say \"what you gonna do when they come at you with F-16s LOL crazy gun freak\" kinda misses the point. The might of the US war machine was defeated by Vietnamese farmers, and it's been nearly 20 years and the West still can't get out of Afghanistan. Never underestimate a bunch of angry guys with Kalashnikovs.",

How much the Panthers actually did for the cause is up for debate - they certainly left an impression - but one consequence of what they called &amp;#39;copwatching&amp;#39; was it led to the NRA actually backing gun control laws in California (the Mulford Act, 1967) which barred open carry and signed by none other than Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fpk6P4kOqE\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fpk6P4kOqE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are few countries with gun cultures similiar to the States (Pakistan, maybe?), and in the last century or so the weapons used in uprisings, civil wars, etc. usually come from deserters, foreign backers, raided military or police armouries, underworld traffickers and so on. But in my view, the argument certain anti-gun advocates (I&amp;#39;m neutral; not American; don&amp;#39;t care) make when they say &amp;quot;what you gonna do when they come at you with F-16s LOL crazy gun freak&amp;quot; kinda misses the point. The might of the US war machine was defeated by Vietnamese farmers, and it&amp;#39;s been nearly 20 years and the West still can&amp;#39;t get out of Afghanistan. Never underestimate a bunch of angry guys with Kalashnikovs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But before anyone autistically screeches about how real communism hasn&amp;#39;t been tried, blah-blah-blah, whatever Marx said this hasn&amp;#39;t yet turned out, and not for a lack of trying.  Our immediate priority is the climate crisis, the class struggle can come later. Don&amp;#39;t forget the first climate legislation in the US was actually signed by that god-damn tree-hugging hippy, Richard Nixon. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a politician you like (Nixon was a scumbag) to get things done.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism\"&gt;https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
