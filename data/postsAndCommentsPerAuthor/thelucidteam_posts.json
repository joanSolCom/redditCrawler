Nine years ago I was diagnosed with Bi-polar 1 Disorder, after over a year of un-diagnosed mania and psychosis that caused a number of lasting scars in my life.\n\nIn February 2012, I was forcibly hospitalized for the first time and kicked out of the music conservatory I was studying at. My life has never been the same since. That hospital experience itself was traumatizing. I had a doctor tell me to cope with the fact that I couldn't finish school, wouldn't be able to keep a professional job, and should ultimately settle into a more passive lifestyle.\n\nBefore this experience, my dream was to be a professional musician - but at that point I decided to dedicate my life to creating a more empathetic mental health system. In the last years of my 2nd round of university, I came up with a really big idea. That idea has grown into a company of ten artists, musicians and engineers. We have spent the last 2 years working tirelessly to turn music into a validated medicine for mental health.\n\nIf you also struggle with anxiety, stress, or any other mental health challenges - know that you’re not alone, and there’s help out here! We recently started [a program](http://www.thelucidproject.ca/mental-health-support-covid) to offer our music for mental health app (all premium features unlocked) for free to anyone who’s struggling and can’t afford the subscription.
