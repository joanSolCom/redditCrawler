If you trust them, and they trust you, then it's not really up to anyone else to make that determination. But on your way there, be cognizant of the gas station interactions - perhaps wear gloves and pay at the pump. Avoid using the bathroom. The risk should be low if both sides are very strict, and if they aren't in a high-risk areas (New York City, Sioux Falls, places without tight restrictions, big cities, people gathering to protest, etc.). Also note the individual risk to both parties - if older, then riskier. It's more a personal risk-tolerance choice. \n\nI hope that in a few months, we will have mass testing available. When that happens, you will at least have some level of confidence that you and your family aren't sick. Until then, if you really want to visit, then here are some facts. \n\n* Mean time to developing illness is 5 days. So if it's been a week since the last grocery store run for both sides, and no one is sick, then you might be good! (max of 14 days to develop symptoms, but most people will fall around day 5 +/- 3 days.)\n* The current estimate is that 2/3 of spread is through close-contact spread, which is defined as being less than 6 feet apart for more a prolonged period of time (roughly 10 minutes). \n\nIf I really wanted to visit, I'd coordinate public interactions with the other side, then wait 8 days to see if either side develops symptoms. And then I'd be really careful during the trip. Good luck!",

On any social media, you are being monitored. For sure, the NSA reads Reddit. So let's at least admit to all of that.  \nThe contact tracing that we are talking about is what the health department would do anyway, which is to ask you who you've had close contact with for the past 14 days. Close contact is defined by the CDC thus:\n\n* Being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time (something like &gt;10 minutes)    **→6 feet recommendation**\n* Having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)                  **→Face mask recommendation**\n\nSo that's all \"contact tracing\" means. Likely, if you are near someone for over 10 minutes, you know that person. Co-worker, family, etc. The other person would be someone you cared about. Someone you would WANT to notify anyway so they can take appropriate actions. It's really for your benefit to contact trace so you don't kill a whole bunch of co-workers or family members. \n\n1984 is one of my favorite books, and I reference it often. We won't have vaccine ID implants. Not that far down the slippery slope.",

We are already in a surveillance state, as you are likely well aware. On any social media, you are being monitored. For sure, the NSA reads Reddit. So let&amp;#39;s at least admit to all of that.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe contact tracing that we are talking about is what the health department would do anyway, which is to ask you who you&amp;#39;ve had close contact with for the past 14 days. Close contact is defined by the CDC thus:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time (something like &amp;gt;10 minutes)    &lt;strong&gt;→6 feet recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)                  &lt;strong&gt;→Face mask recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;contact tracing&amp;quot; means. Likely, if you are near someone for over 10 minutes, you know that person. Co-worker, family, etc. The other person would be someone you cared about. Someone you would WANT to notify anyway so they can take appropriate actions. It&amp;#39;s really for your benefit to contact trace so you don&amp;#39;t kill a whole bunch of co-workers or family members. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1984 is one of my favorite books, and I reference it often. We won&amp;#39;t have vaccine ID implants. Not that far down the slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It&amp;#39;s a false proposition. We can have our cake and eat it too. That is, we can recover quickly, and we can do so without sacrificing lives.

I don’t know how that lady’s phone call managed to get patched through but it was the early days and we just did whatever was needed. \n\nI remember feeling so accomplished when ThinkGeek placed their Christmas order one year and we had to use a pallet for the first time. We had no hand truck, and the truck had no lift gate. The truck pulled up in front of our house (we ran everything out of our house for the first 5 years) and we had to manually load the pallet and the boxes. The nice truck driver showed us how to use the plastic wrap, and the high school neighbor kid who worked for us ran around the pallet with the wrap while I watched with my baby in my arms. That was a nice memory.\n\nA bad memory was when we were getting ready to drive to the airport to fly to CES. I decided to take a shower at the last minute before we had to leave. Some chemical flew into my eye and burned half of my cornea. It’s was so incredibly painful. We tried washing it out at home with water and saline but it was so painful. Then my husband drove for 2 hours to get to the airport. We went through check-in, took 2 legs of the flight, got to Las Vegas, and went straight to urgent care. My parents who were babysitting for us during CES met us at urgent care. After handing my son to them, I went to the exam room and just bawled. It was so painful, I was so scared I’d lose vision, and I didn’t want to frighten my son. All ended okay though. They gave me nice drugs, and we met a nice ophthalmologist who always wanted to see CES and finally got to. My vision recovered fully. I was kinda hoping it’d be like lasik and I wouldn’t need glasses anymore... haha.",
