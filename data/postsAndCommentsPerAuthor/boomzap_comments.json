SOME of them must be good, just by sheer weight of numbers. :) \n\nBut in all seriousness, the problem with hiring Indian workers is that the world *knows* they make good coders. And so the world has set up huge multinational centers that hire a LOT of them in places like Hyderabad, Bangalore, etc. If you are hiring in India, you're competing with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. And as a small indie studio, I have a challenge competing with... Google. \n\nYou are also going to deal with infrastructure issues in a WFH situation. Power going out. Internet going out. etc. The big data centers who have people working in an office can afford big trunk lines, generators, etc. to make sure these problems are minimized. Some guy working in his mom's spare room in Chennai... less so. Of course, we deal with this in Indonesia and Philippines as well. And Malaysia to a lesser extent. It's a cost of doing business in the developing world. \n\nThat being said, we have has people in our studio from both India and Pakistan in the past, and they were great.",

SOME of them must be good, just by sheer weight of numbers. :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in all seriousness, the problem with hiring Indian workers is that the world &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; they make good coders. And so the world has set up huge multinational centers that hire a LOT of them in places like Hyderabad, Bangalore, etc. If you are hiring in India, you&amp;#39;re competing with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. And as a small indie studio, I have a challenge competing with... Google. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are also going to deal with infrastructure issues in a WFH situation. Power going out. Internet going out. etc. The big data centers who have people working in an office can afford big trunk lines, generators, etc. to make sure these problems are minimized. Some guy working in his mom&amp;#39;s spare room in Chennai... less so. Of course, we deal with this in Indonesia and Philippines as well. And Malaysia to a lesser extent. It&amp;#39;s a cost of doing business in the developing world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, we have has people in our studio from both India and Pakistan in the past, and they were great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And for sound production especially - it will open doors for you to have people know that you have formal training where a lot of people don't. But that being said *where* you got that degree ain't that important, so I'd not throw down a lot of money for somewhere really expensive. \n\nI would also, if you are early in this process, consider looking into a CS degree. It's WAY easier to get a job working in audio for games if you are actually an audio coder that knows how to make good music and sound. Those people are gold. and if you CANT get a job in games audio... you've still got a CS degree, giving you a lot of options a specialized audio-only degree wouldn't give you.\n\nBut regardlss of ANY of that - 75% of any hiring decision for any audio or art position is gonna be your portfolio. So yeah - prioritize that. And specifically prioritize *diversity* - show that you can do a lot of different things. Audio companies are SMALL - just a few people. If ALL you can do is one kind of music... there won't be rom for you there. You need to have the ability to do a diverse selection of music AND sound if you want to be hireable.",

And for sound production especially - it will open doors for you to have people know that you have formal training where a lot of people don&amp;#39;t. But that being said &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; you got that degree ain&amp;#39;t that important, so I&amp;#39;d not throw down a lot of money for somewhere really expensive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also, if you are early in this process, consider looking into a CS degree. It&amp;#39;s WAY easier to get a job working in audio for games if you are actually an audio coder that knows how to make good music and sound. Those people are gold. and if you CANT get a job in games audio... you&amp;#39;ve still got a CS degree, giving you a lot of options a specialized audio-only degree wouldn&amp;#39;t give you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But regardlss of ANY of that - 75% of any hiring decision for any audio or art position is gonna be your portfolio. So yeah - prioritize that. And specifically prioritize &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; - show that you can do a lot of different things. Audio companies are SMALL - just a few people. If ALL you can do is one kind of music... there won&amp;#39;t be rom for you there. You need to have the ability to do a diverse selection of music AND sound if you want to be hireable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Probably the most famous game I worked on was Far Cry - I was the producer for the first one back in... jeezus, was 2004 that long ago? That was an amazing, career-changing game for me - and it's what gave me the confidence to think \"Yeah, I could run a game company\" But, at the end of the day, Far Cry was Cevat's game, not mine. (Cevat Yerli was one of teh 3 brothers who owned/ran Crytek, who I worked for). I had a lot to do with that game, but it was his dream that started it, not mine.\n\nThe first game that I can really call my own, that was a raging success, was a beautiful little Hidden Object game called Awakening that was the first real blockbuster for Boomzap. It was good enough to spawn like... seven sequels? And our audience just loved it. But even that game... I have to admit, while it started with an idea I had, there were other really amazing people who probably drove them more.

That was an amazing, career-changing game for me - and it&amp;#39;s what gave me the confidence to think &amp;quot;Yeah, I could run a game company&amp;quot; But, at the end of the day, Far Cry was Cevat&amp;#39;s game, not mine. (Cevat Yerli was one of teh 3 brothers who owned/ran Crytek, who I worked for). I had a lot to do with that game, but it was his dream that started it, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first game that I can really call my own, that was a raging success, was a beautiful little Hidden Object game called Awakening that was the first real blockbuster for Boomzap. It was good enough to spawn like... seven sequels? And our audience just loved it. But even that game... I have to admit, while it started with an idea I had, there were other really amazing people who probably drove them more.

This isn't about the money but it's about the work-from-home situation. Somebody who already lives in a city that's got a lot of job opportunities for them isn't going to be as excited about our offer as somebody who lives in a small town in the middle of nowhere in Indonesia where this offers a huge opportunity for them to work in games and still be in a location that's not very game Rich. Also generally people who have some sort of special situation, like family members at home that they need to take care of or something like that. That kind of person is really getting a huge advantage out of our work from home situation. They're going to be a lot more excited about the job, they're going to work harder to protect it, and they're probably going to stick around a lot longer. That retention is really a key metric for us because retention means you can invest time and energy in training somebody in the way that you want to make your games.

This isn&amp;#39;t about the money but it&amp;#39;s about the work-from-home situation. Somebody who already lives in a city that&amp;#39;s got a lot of job opportunities for them isn&amp;#39;t going to be as excited about our offer as somebody who lives in a small town in the middle of nowhere in Indonesia where this offers a huge opportunity for them to work in games and still be in a location that&amp;#39;s not very game Rich. Also generally people who have some sort of special situation, like family members at home that they need to take care of or something like that. That kind of person is really getting a huge advantage out of our work from home situation. They&amp;#39;re going to be a lot more excited about the job, they&amp;#39;re going to work harder to protect it, and they&amp;#39;re probably going to stick around a lot longer. That retention is really a key metric for us because retention means you can invest time and energy in training somebody in the way that you want to make your games. It&amp;#39;s hard to overemphasize how important this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "How deep is a hole? The truth is as companies like ours that are distributed become more and more common, the world rate for work that can be done remotely is flattening. This is great for people in low cost places (like Manila) and hard for people in high cost places (like San Francisco and London). I honestly don't know HOW California companies still make sense of what they are paying for labor when there is so much amazing talent in places like Manila, Jakarta - or for that matter, Hong Kong and Singapore - where a dollar goes a lot further. \n\nThat being said, I think a lot of people have the wrong idea about how to capitalize on this. Yes, you CAN get a artist in Manila to do good work for peanuts - buut you won't keep her. She's gonna quickly figure out that she is worth a lot more than that on the world market, and you're gonna basically pay to train her for a studio that's willing to pay her more. That's a foolish way to run a business.\n\nInstead, what we do is pay a very good wage for the places we hire in - and assume that our staff is gonna stick around for a while. And they do. We have people who have been with us in Malaysisa for almost 15 years. They've bought houses on what we've paid them.

The truth is as companies like ours that are distributed become more and more common, the world rate for work that can be done remotely is flattening. This is great for people in low cost places (like Manila) and hard for people in high cost places (like San Francisco and London). I honestly don&amp;#39;t know HOW California companies still make sense of what they are paying for labor when there is so much amazing talent in places like Manila, Jakarta - or for that matter, Hong Kong and Singapore - where a dollar goes a lot further. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think a lot of people have the wrong idea about how to capitalize on this. Yes, you CAN get a artist in Manila to do good work for peanuts - buut you won&amp;#39;t keep her. She&amp;#39;s gonna quickly figure out that she is worth a lot more than that on the world market, and you&amp;#39;re gonna basically pay to train her for a studio that&amp;#39;s willing to pay her more. That&amp;#39;s a foolish way to run a business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, what we do is pay a very good wage for the places we hire in - and assume that our staff is gonna stick around for a while. And they do. We have people who have been with us in Malaysisa for almost 15 years. They&amp;#39;ve bought houses on what we&amp;#39;ve paid them. And you can&amp;#39;t pay enough for skilled, senior staff like that with long term institutional knowledge of your company. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you treat your staff like that, they are willing to stick with you in the hard times.

        "body": "Actually our turnover is... really low after they have been here 6 months. We shake out a lot of people in probation as they realize this way of working/living isn't for them. But that's fine - this isn't for everyone. And we all part ways happy when we agree they're better off in a different structure. We have started doing sort term contract work (Make this asset, etc) before probation to test working with people before probation, and that has lowered our losses in probation a great deal. \n\nOnce they get out of probation, our retention is super high. The first 2 people we ever hired, 15 years ago - are still here. Most of our current staff has been with us 5+ years, actually. This isn't based on some concept of loyalty - thats not really a thing for us. They don't *owe* me anything. It's the oposite. It's my job to ensure that working with us is the best option for them. Because of the freedom our system offers, the quality of the people they work with, and the reasonable pay... most people find it difficult to leave. \n\nThe few who have have usually gone on to start their own companies (and remain good friends of ours) or to freelance work at home or jobs with other virtual companies like ours.

We shake out a lot of people in probation as they realize this way of working/living isn&amp;#39;t for them. But that&amp;#39;s fine - this isn&amp;#39;t for everyone. And we all part ways happy when we agree they&amp;#39;re better off in a different structure. We have started doing sort term contract work (Make this asset, etc) before probation to test working with people before probation, and that has lowered our losses in probation a great deal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once they get out of probation, our retention is super high. The first 2 people we ever hired, 15 years ago - are still here. Most of our current staff has been with us 5+ years, actually. This isn&amp;#39;t based on some concept of loyalty - thats not really a thing for us. They don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;owe&lt;/em&gt; me anything. It&amp;#39;s the oposite. It&amp;#39;s my job to ensure that working with us is the best option for them. Because of the freedom our system offers, the quality of the people they work with, and the reasonable pay... most people find it difficult to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The few who have have usually gone on to start their own companies (and remain good friends of ours) or to freelance work at home or jobs with other virtual companies like ours.

But we want their &amp;quot;game energy&amp;quot; on our games, so they are exclusive to us for game development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;Pay-by-task&amp;quot; contractors are given work as we have it - such as &amp;quot;make these characters&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Make this Hidden Object scene&amp;quot; - and since I am not promising them to always have work for them on a consistent monthly basis, it would be unrealistic and unfair of me to expect them to ONLY work with us. For them, they are welcome to take any contracts they want, in or out of games. It&amp;#39;s my responsibility to pay well enough, and  make our projects interesting enough that we&amp;#39;re their first priority. That&amp;#39;s how the free market is supposed to work. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

All you care about is the number of tasks that people get done every day, and the quality of those tasks.

One of the real challenges in writing a video game is to take that author part of you, the one who wants to tell a story, and shove him down. You need to stop yourself from writing that story, because in games, the players want to make their own stories.\n\nIn books, the characters do precisely what the author tells them to do, think, and say. You can’t do that in games. There’s this other person who wants to do their own thing and make their decisions meaningful. The game writer must fight the urge to say “You’re not supposed to do that! You’re supposed to go here and do this!” For example, players would have a choice if they want to go here or there, so a designer has to make both of these places interesting.\n\nThis brings us to writing the lore of r/LastRegiment. Before you can write a specific story, you must first create the world where it takes place in. Months ago we started putting together a skeleton outline on the basic ideas about the universe, and gradually adding notes on how the world is, who the characters are, and what the history is. Since we were looking at it from a wider angle, there was some confusion on what would actually be happening in the game.\n\nAs we build the art for the game, we started getting questions on why we have a variety of characters with very diverse themes. For some it didn’t make sense, and that was problematic. Then we continued to flesh out the ancient history of the world to show how all the factions and units came to be, and conveyed this to the team.\n\nThe next story dump included more details on the period called The Reconquest, when people from the old world started to go back to a continent that they had tried to colonize in the past. This is where the story takes place, after several years of apocalyptic wars between the races where they used both magic and machinery. This was inspired by the modern age of the Enlightenment Era, and we looked at the colonial histories in Europe instead of the usual medieval setting of fantasy games.\n\nIf you look at the heroes and units in the game, none of them appear in the history. When you’re putting together a world, the first step is the large history of that world. The second step is detailing the facets of that world such as the technology, magic, transportation, weaponry, money, language, races, and a bunch more data that needs to be compiled. After these two are done, the final step is the actual story of the characters in the game: where are they going, what do they need,  how do they meet, etc.\n\nDoing the first two steps is important before you start anything because you need something that could lend something before you get to the end. But even when you reach the final step, you should be aware that sometimes the world and some of its faces might change because of the new things you are adding to the game.",
