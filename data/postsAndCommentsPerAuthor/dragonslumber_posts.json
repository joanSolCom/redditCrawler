I am currently working on a first person puzzle game in the vein of Portal and The Talos Principle, and am looking for a 3d unity artist to provide an artistic direction.\n\nThe game has been in development for about 2 months. It uses light for puzzle mechanics and has about 10-15 puzzle rooms created, along with most of the puzzle mechanics added. My objective is to reach a proper vertical slice in the next month or two and to get financing from a publisher. I aim to launch in 2021 for PCs, with console ports to follow.\n\nI'm looking for an artist who knows their way around Unity, can establish a nice visual style, ambiant lighting, as well as take care of assets like the projectors, environments, etc. Some of my current inspirations include [NaissanceE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265690/NaissanceE/) and some of the visually simpler FPPs like Qube 2. This is for rev share.\n\nHere are a few screenshots of the current build.

I still don&amp;#39;t know why root motion was being turned off and this might cause issues later down the road, but it seems fine at this point and I hope it can help someone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void OnAnimatorMove()\n    {\n            transform.parent.position += anmator.deltaPosition;\n    }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I gotta say, I wasn't convinced about bros going on a trip, but the pre-title sequence with the music and all that just immediately got me grinning and set the tone for a story I wanted to get invested in. From the environments to explore to the battle system, everything just felt right as a game, even if it's nothing like a traditional Final Fantasy.\n\nOne thing though, what's up with Justice Monster V? It's a pachinko like game with character powers and levels, it sounds like it would be cool but it just feels off and aimless, I don't understand the hook of that design at all.

I gotta say, I wasn&amp;#39;t convinced about bros going on a trip, but the pre-title sequence with the music and all that just immediately got me grinning and set the tone for a story I wanted to get invested in. From the environments to explore to the battle system, everything just felt right as a game, even if it&amp;#39;s nothing like a traditional Final Fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing though, what&amp;#39;s up with Justice Monster V? It&amp;#39;s a pachinko like game with character powers and levels, it sounds like it would be cool but it just feels off and aimless, I don&amp;#39;t understand the hook of that design at all. Any story behind that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Why didn&amp;#39;t Cyan just make the 5th tile empty to simplify the process? They must have known how terrible this was, and so easy to solve from a design perspective too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This puzzle has completely destroyed any love for Obduction or any game Cyan may put out in the future.

In 2017, I quit my job to do this full time and released Arelite Core a month later. I've since released Astral Traveler also in 2017 and Tech Support: Error Unknown in 2019.\n\nI act as the designer, programmer and producer for all of my titles, and recently have been learning 3d art for my newest project, an open world first person puzzle game called Aethernaut which I'm letting people play for the first time during Gamescom. I also have a separate unannounced project in the works which is being worked on by interns.\n\nI've chronicled the last three years of my dev life in blog posts on Gamasutra and am happy to answer any questions about it. I've had a lot of ups and downs and learning lessons which I hope to share.\n\nProof:   [https://twitter.com/dragon\\_slumber/status/1299388122288074753](https://twitter.com/dragon_slumber/status/1299388122288074753)\n\n\\[Current game and demo\\] Aethernaut: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360720/Aethernaut/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360720/Aethernaut/)\n\nTech Support: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/781480/Tech\\_Support\\_Error\\_Unknown/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/781480/Tech_Support_Error_Unknown/)\n\nArelite Core: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/466160/Arelite\\_Core/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/466160/Arelite_Core/)\n\nAstral Traveler: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/618630/Astral\\_Traveler/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/618630/Astral_Traveler/)\n\n**Edit:** I see that things are starting to wind down, and I'm still going to hang out and answer questions as I can, but I want to thank everyone who joined in, asked a question and upvoted. I really didn't know what to expect but I hope I managed to help all of you and give some perspective on being a dev, especially when you're not one of the top tier well known developers. I encourage you to continue asking questions, or even join me on my Discord and chat with me directly:  [https://discord.gg/dragonslumber](https://discord.gg/dragonslumber) \n\nThanks again, peace out!",

My name is Kevin Giguère and I&amp;#39;m the sole member of Dragon Slumber, a company I founded in 2013 to work on my first indie game. In 2017, I quit my job to do this full time and released Arelite Core a month later. I&amp;#39;ve since released Astral Traveler also in 2017 and Tech Support: Error Unknown in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I act as the designer, programmer and producer for all of my titles, and recently have been learning 3d art for my newest project, an open world first person puzzle game called Aethernaut which I&amp;#39;m letting people play for the first time during Gamescom. I also have a separate unannounced project in the works which is being worked on by interns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve chronicled the last three years of my dev life in blog posts on Gamasutra and am happy to answer any questions about it. I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of ups and downs and learning lessons which I hope to share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof:   &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/dragon_slumber/status/1299388122288074753\"&gt;https://twitter.com/dragon_slumber/status/1299388122288074753&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Current game and demo] Aethernaut: &lt;a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360720/Aethernaut/\"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360720/Aethernaut/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech Support: &lt;a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/781480/Tech_Support_Error_Unknown/\"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/781480/Tech_Support_Error_Unknown/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arelite Core: &lt;a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/466160/Arelite_Core/\"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/466160/Arelite_Core/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Astral Traveler: &lt;a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/618630/Astral_Traveler/\"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/618630/Astral_Traveler/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I see that things are starting to wind down, and I&amp;#39;m still going to hang out and answer questions as I can, but I want to thank everyone who joined in, asked a question and upvoted. I really didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect but I hope I managed to help all of you and give some perspective on being a dev, especially when you&amp;#39;re not one of the top tier well known developers. I encourage you to continue asking questions, or even join me on my Discord and chat with me directly:  &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/dragonslumber\"&gt;https://discord.gg/dragonslumber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again, peace out!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am currently working on a first person puzzle game in the vein of Portal and The Talos Principle, and am looking for a 3d unity artist to provide an artistic direction.\n\nThe game has been in development for about 2 months. It uses light for puzzle mechanics and has about 10-15 puzzle rooms created, along with most of the puzzle mechanics added. My objective is to reach a proper vertical slice in the next month or two and to get financing from a publisher. I aim to launch in 2021 for PCs, with console ports to follow.\n\nI'm looking for an artist who knows their way around Unity, can establish a nice visual style, ambiant lighting, as well as take care of assets like the projectors, environments, etc. Some of my current inspirations include [NaissanceE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265690/NaissanceE/) and some of the visually simpler FPPs like Qube 2. This is for rev share.\n\nHere are a few screenshots of the current build.

I add the mesh field through a Prefab but that doesn't seem to matter since the SubMeshUI is created at runtime anyways. I've seen no place where this tint is applied, either through code, or XML parameters, or the material of the mesh, or the font itself. Anyone ever encounter this issue and how can I solve it?\n\nThanks,",

I add the mesh field through a Prefab but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to matter since the SubMeshUI is created at runtime anyways. I&amp;#39;ve seen no place where this tint is applied, either through code, or XML parameters, or the material of the mesh, or the font itself. Anyone ever encounter this issue and how can I solve it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The best rated channels are presented more often. Viewers also earn achievements, experience and levels according to what they do on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can sign up at &lt;a href=\"https://tubespark.com\"&gt;https://tubespark.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
