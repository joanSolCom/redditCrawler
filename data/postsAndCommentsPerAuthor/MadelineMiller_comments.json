This is all the subject of a gorgeous, moving tragedy by Sophocles (Philoctetes), which is one of my all-time favorite pieces of ancient poetry.  Philoctetes' monologues about being old and in pain, and feeling left behind by the world are heart-breaking.  Even though it has a surprisingly happy ending for a tragedy, it still makes me tear up.  \n\nTrivia fact: Philoctetes is the one who kills Paris.\n\nOther than that (and my apologies that this is a boring answer, but it's true), my favorites are Patroclus and Circe.\n\nAnd Hector.  \n\nChiron.\n\nDaedalus.\n\nPenelope.\n\nOkay, I'm cutting myself off!",
