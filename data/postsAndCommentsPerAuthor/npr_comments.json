Like - I will never endorse a candidate on our air. But I CAN say - well, the thing that politician did - it is universally, all around a bad or a good move. I think I am allowed that, especially on issues where my experience offers me particular credence to comment on such things - like issues of race, or even sexuality, to a certain extent.

Instead ask yourself what DOES feel doable right now. If you can't motivate yourself to get out of the house, could you at least get out of your pajamas? If you can't get out of your pajamas, could you start by getting out of bed? Give yourself credit for each step that you take. I would also recommend that people try to let go of some of their \"shoulds,\" and focus more on their \"wants\" and \"needs.\" It's going to be a lot easier to get out of bed when it's framed as something that you WANT to do rather than as something that you \"should\" or \"have to\" do. (Because if you \"should\" do it and you don't, you are framing yourself as a failure.) I also really like this parenting advice someone once gave me: when your kid says that they \"can't\" do something, you prompt them to add \"yet.\" As in, \"I can't tie my shoes . . . yet.\" \"I can't read . . . yet.\" It acknowledges where you are right now, but conveys a sense of hope and positivity — and confidence in yourself. I use this trick on myself when I feel frustrated or overwhelmed. --Catherine**",

When Brent and I were putting the show together, we asked all of our friends and colleagues to offer suggestions for segments or anything really, and my friend Theo Balcomb (now at The Daily) suggested we put the best things thing on the air in some way. The rest is history. ALSO - the Who Said That intro sound is actually a clip from the Real Housewives of Atlanta! I show I love. Betty is the voice you here in the rest of the show, tho. My colleague Brent Baughman made the ask. And Betty said yes without hesitation. I don&amp;#39;t think she fully knew what she was signing up for!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "**Thank you for listening and for the question! So - being out as a journalist has actually been a long journey for me. I come from a very religious strict Pentecostal/Apostolic family. So - just coming out in my personal life was a thing that happened later for me. Like, I wasn't really out until my mid to late twenties. And it really came in waves. You come out to a few, then to a few more. Tis is why Coming Out Day always kind of annoyed me. For most of us - it's never just one day! Anywho, after I was just like, out as a human in the world, there were these big questions about whether it made sense to address my sexuality in my reporting. When I was covering breaking news, I never felt the need to add an \"I'm gay\" to a story about ya know, stock market fluctuations. But as my journalism has come to include more of my personality, especially on my show It's Been A Minute, it increasingly felt strange NOT to share that. So I did. We had a big coming out story in which I talked about my sexuality and a lot of other folks sexuality. It was one of our best-performing episodes to date.

I come from a very religious strict Pentecostal/Apostolic family. So - just coming out in my personal life was a thing that happened later for me. Like, I wasn&amp;#39;t really out until my mid to late twenties. And it really came in waves. You come out to a few, then to a few more. Tis is why Coming Out Day always kind of annoyed me. For most of us - it&amp;#39;s never just one day! Anywho, after I was just like, out as a human in the world, there were these big questions about whether it made sense to address my sexuality in my reporting. When I was covering breaking news, I never felt the need to add an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gay&amp;quot; to a story about ya know, stock market fluctuations. But as my journalism has come to include more of my personality, especially on my show It&amp;#39;s Been A Minute, it increasingly felt strange NOT to share that. So I did. We had a big coming out story in which I talked about my sexuality and a lot of other folks sexuality. It was one of our best-performing episodes to date. Now, for me, the conversation I have with myself about my sexuality (and my race) - is &amp;quot;how do I embody those things for ME, in a way that feels right for ME?&amp;quot; Like, I refuse to be black-on-demand, or gay-on-demand.

If you can't get out of your pajamas, could you start by getting out of bed? Give yourself credit for each step that you take. I would also recommend that people try to let go of some of their \"shoulds,\" and focus more on their \"wants\" and \"needs.\" It's going to be a lot easier to get out of bed when it's framed as something that you WANT to do rather than as something that you \"should\" or \"have to\" do. (Because if you \"should\" do it and you don't, you are framing yourself as a failure.) I also really like this parenting advice someone once gave me: when your kid says that they \"can't\" do something, you prompt them to add \"yet.\" As in, \"I can't tie my shoes . . . yet.\" \"I can't read . . . yet.\" It acknowledges where you are right now, but conveys a sense of hope and positivity — and confidence in yourself.

I personally am coping by doing my best to focus on the things I CAN control in my life, rather than obsess over all the things that I can't.

Before, healthy might have meant going to the gym for a high-intensity workout five times a week and cooking all your meals from scratch; now it might mean going for a walk twice a week and trying to eat one vegetable a day (if that). We’re in literal survival mode, so we all need to reimagine what our lives look like in that context. Lower your expectations and plan that you’re going to be able to do WAY less now, and celebrate any and every small healthy thing (getting enough sleep, drinking water, calling a friend) you’re able to do. Trust that you’re enough, that what you’re doing is enough — the goal is to make it through this alive, with your body and mind relatively in tact. Anything on top of that is a bonus. — Rachel**",

Before, healthy might have meant going to the gym for a high-intensity workout five times a week and cooking all your meals from scratch; now it might mean going for a walk twice a week and trying to eat one vegetable a day (if that). We’re in literal survival mode, so we all need to reimagine what our lives look like in that context. Lower your expectations and plan that you’re going to be able to do WAY less now, and celebrate any and every small healthy thing (getting enough sleep, drinking water, calling a friend) you’re able to do. Trust that you’re enough, that what you’re doing is enough — the goal is to make it through this alive, with your body and mind relatively in tact. Anything on top of that is a bonus. — Rachel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Great question. There are a number of ways to offer support to a child whose guardians have addiction issues. First, take an active interest in this child's life. Research clearly points to the presence of a caring, nurturing adult in a child's life that can make such a big difference. Spend time, listen, play, find fun activities to share with this kid. Even if you never broach the subject of addiction, you can provide, support, care, and hope. If you believe bringing up the topic of addiction is warranted and necessary, sometimes it can be a real challenge to find the right words and do it in an age-appropriate way. Maybe a book would help get the ball rolling on this. An excellent resource is the National Association for Children of Addiction (NACoA). Take a look at their website at [**www.nacoa.org**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/www.nacoa.org__;!!Iwwt!C1DbbjJdTYJLbMP50tKIXgAQgoDNu4BA8rZ6qYLVm95XuischQ4zsB-9vlk$). Under resources look for the Kit for Children. It is both free and downloadable. It provides a wealth of information, skill building strategies, and hope. You can review it first and pick which parts might be helpful to start a discussion. It's important to share these important messages: it's not your fault, you are not alone and there are safe people and places that can help. While you are at it, you might also want to download and print the Kit for Parents. While you obviously are not the parent in this case, many grandparents and other relatives and friends look at this as another valuable resource. ",

His substance use disorder is not a reflection of him being less than a good man or that he doesn't care for his children. We are not our disease. Talking openly about it -- and accurately, with no hint of stigma -- is advised. But their dad at this time is also experiencing shame, it sounds like. He perhaps has not yet come to understand that he has an illness, rather than a lack of willpower. My hope for you is that he will, and that you will, grow more comfortable talking about it openly. The problem with secrets is they imply that a secret is warranted. There is no shame in addiction. Millions of people have substance use disorders. Millions recover. It's actually a rather common condition. In the Hazelden Betty Ford Children's program we teach boys and girls that people who suffer from addiction, are not bad people. But, when they are trapped, they sometimes do bad things. I believe it's important for you to be honest with your children about what's going on with their dad, when children experience trauma in their lives and no one explains it in an age appropriate way, they often make up a story for it to make sense. Unfortunately, the story many boys and girls tell, is that somehow it must be their fault. It's important for your daughters to know that it's not their fault and they can't make this better. Please go to :**[Sesame Street Communities](https://www.sesamestreetincommunitites.org) **and look under the tab: Parental Addiction. There is a brand new muppet named Karli whose mom suffers from addiction. There are some wonderful resources for you at this site for you to explore and determine which of these you will share with your girls.  Also featured on this tab is a girl name Selia, a 10 year old girl, who has both parents who have been hurt by addiction but are now working on recovery. Please also look at the activity 'The 7 C's,' and share the important message with your girls. I believe you can share what's going on with their dad in a caring way so that they'll continue to love him, even though they might have a lot of other feelings about his disease.**",

Sometimes, a voice is so compelling (e.g. Wenyuan Fan&amp;#39;s Stormquakes), we&amp;#39;ll build an entire episode around their work. Other times, the topic captures our attention (sleep paralysis? space junk?) and we&amp;#39;ll bring our personalities to the reporting. While we script the entire episode, Maddie and I are always looking for opportunities to improvise and interact with our guests. We&amp;#39;re looking for stuff that makes our own ears perk up or our own hearts strum. And—I cannot overstate this enough—the producers on Short Wave (Rebecca Ramirez, Brit Hanson, Brent Baughman) and our editor, Viet Le, are the real heroes that make the episodes sing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MS: Retweet what Emily says about the producers and editors on the show.

Research finds that people actually like talking about meaning things more than we think, so you could try experimenting with asking more probing questions more quickly. I think getting a conversation started is something that we can get better at, but I still fail regularly - after all, the other person has to cooperate, for it to work.**  \n\n**3. I have moved around a bit, though lots of people have moved more. I don't find it hard to talk to people and build a network of acquaintances, but finding those special people that I feel really close to, and safe with, is harder, and most of the people I'm closest to right now don't live in the same place, so I have lots of Skype chats across time zones. But in each new place, I meet people through my hobbies. I try to say yes as much as possible when people invite me to do things, and I also take the initiative to reach out to people, even if I've only met them once. Just as you don't find a favorite book or movie by reading only one book or watching only one movie, you might not meet your tribe by only hanging out with a few people. In one place, I unintentionally started a lunch group - I invited one person, and then when I wanted to get to know another person, it seemed to efficient to invite them to the same lunch. We got together again, and then they invited people, and soon we had a lively group that changed every week.

I see it as a means to an end - it&amp;#39;s a way to start talking, so you can get to the good stuff. Research finds that people actually like talking about meaning things more than we think, so you could try experimenting with asking more probing questions more quickly. I think getting a conversation started is something that we can get better at, but I still fail regularly - after all, the other person has to cooperate, for it to work.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I have moved around a bit, though lots of people have moved more. I don&amp;#39;t find it hard to talk to people and build a network of acquaintances, but finding those special people that I feel really close to, and safe with, is harder, and most of the people I&amp;#39;m closest to right now don&amp;#39;t live in the same place, so I have lots of Skype chats across time zones. But in each new place, I meet people through my hobbies. I try to say yes as much as possible when people invite me to do things, and I also take the initiative to reach out to people, even if I&amp;#39;ve only met them once. Just as you don&amp;#39;t find a favorite book or movie by reading only one book or watching only one movie, you might not meet your tribe by only hanging out with a few people. In one place, I unintentionally started a lunch group - I invited one person, and then when I wanted to get to know another person, it seemed to efficient to invite them to the same lunch. We got together again, and then they invited people, and soon we had a lively group that changed every week.

My friend Rachel Wilkerson Miller who I spoke to in my reporting has a really interesting perspective on how to evaluate friendships that I think would be helpful here. She talks about it in her book, The Art of Showing Up (**[preorder it here!](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Showing-Up-Yourself-People/dp/1615196617)**). Basically, she says that relationships can weigh on your time, your money and your energy: TME. And so if you use these three concepts to evaluate the relationships that are important to you, it can be clarifying.

I find that establishing some kind of regular check in — weekly, biweekly or even monthly — and sticking to it can take the pressure off both parties to keep maintaining the relationship. Also, give yourself permission to send a little silly emoji or a “hi, I’m thinking of you” text occasionally to keep in touch. It’s ok to be busy and to struggle finding the time. Releasing yourself from the pressure of having to send a BIG, meaningful email or text can be really helpful. — Julia**",

We focused instead on herders and rural families, affected by the mining industry. I had heard stories from friends who traveled of attacks on foreigners, particularly those of Chinese appearance. As a half-Chinese person, this made me quite nervous at the outset. But on the ground, I didn&amp;#39;t experience any issues nor hear of any recent instances of xenophobic attacks. As to your second question, that&amp;#39;s a spot-on insight. Those we spoke with felt absolute longing for their native country. It came across in interview after interview: a coal truck driver who flipped through photos of Selenge on her phone, a father who took his daughters to visit the family&amp;#39;s horses in Dornod as often as possible. Even in the city, the walls of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;gers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(those circular tents) are decorated with pictures of pastoral life. I would really like to report on solastalgia some day, this emergent idea of mental/existential distress caused by environmental loss. Thanks for following the series. — Emily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I have not noticed Hong Kong coming up.  More to your point: Will the US help Hong Kong? Human rights issues of that sort have not been a top priority of the administrtaion. They pay attention in places of course, but the president explicitly dismisses initiatives that are not defined as strictly in the US interest as he defines it.

But learning to evaluate the data is really tricky. That’s why journalists -- and scientists -- devote their whole careers to this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

When you eat refined carbs, like white bread and pretzels, they’re really just one step away from becoming sugar in your body: Your blood sugar and insulin levels spike, and that ends up making you hungrier. And a seminal study was just published that found people eating a processed foods diet ended up eating more calories than those on a whole foods diet. One really interesting finding from that: When the participants were eating the unprocessed diet, they had higher levels of an appetite-suppressing hormone called PYY, which is secreted by the gut, and lower levels of ghrelin, a hunger hormone, which might explain why they ate fewer calories. On the ultra-processed diet, these hormonal changes flipped, so participants had lower levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone and higher levels of the hunger hormone.**",

And a seminal study was just published that found people eating a processed foods diet ended up eating more calories than those on a whole foods diet. One really interesting finding from that: When the participants were eating the unprocessed diet, they had higher levels of an appetite-suppressing hormone called PYY, which is secreted by the gut, and lower levels of ghrelin, a hunger hormone, which might explain why they ate fewer calories. On the ultra-processed diet, these hormonal changes flipped, so participants had lower levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone and higher levels of the hunger hormone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
