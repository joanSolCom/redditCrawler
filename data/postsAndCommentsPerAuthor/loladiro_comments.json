Hence I want the generated code to be specialized on this without the whole Julia engine overhead.  Do you see this in PackageCompiler future?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, we&amp;#39;ve talked about approaches to this (and I went into more detail in another answer), but it&amp;#39;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On the other hand, if the language is written by the applications people, it'll be super useful, but as a CS person, you just go \"Oh no, no, no, no\" when you look at the semantics (mostly for reasons immaterial to why the language is nice to use - but impossible to fix once it's been around long enough for the CS people to get interested).

I think these days it&amp;#39;s probably easiest to justify Julia via the use cases that it enables (see e.g. here &lt;a href=\"https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/\"&gt;https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/&lt;/a&gt;). Some of them would have been impossible or very hard to do in other languages.

Reading other software is one of the primary tools you have as a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On the other hand, if the language is written by the applications people, it'll be super useful, but as a CS person, you just go \"Oh no, no, no, no\" when you look at the semantics (mostly for reasons immaterial to why the language is nice to use - but impossible to fix once it's been around long enough for the CS people to get interested).

For example, the programmer may write \\`a + b\\`, and the machine will go off and do things. Now the difference between static dispatch, single dispatch and multiple dispatch is basically the following: If the language always tries to do the same thing, no matter what \\`a\\` and \\`b\\` are, that's static dispatch. If the machine looks at what \\`a\\` is to decide what to do, that's single dispatch, and if the machine looks at both \\`a\\` and \\`b\\` that's multiple dispatch. There's many reasons multiple dispatch is useful, but one of the primary ones is that it allows easy extensibility. Suppose you have two people, one working with cats, one working with dogs.\n\nThe cat person might write:\n\n    meet(a::Cat, b::Cat) = meow()\n    \n\nthe dog person might write\n\n    meet(a::Dog, b::Dog) = sniff()\n\n\nbut what if you're neither of those people, but you got a dog from one and a cat from the other. In a single dispatch system, you'd have to go talk to the cat and the dog person and get them to change their code to something like:\n\n    meet(a::Cat, b) = if isa(b, Cat); meow(); elseif isa(b, Dog); growl(); else; error(); end\n\nand similarly to the dog person.\n\nIn a multiple dispatch system, you don't have to go to either person, and you can just say:\n\n    meet(a::Cat, b::Dog) = growl()\n\nThere's lot of nuance here, but that's the basic idea. When I say \"go to\", I here I may or may not mean \"go talk to\". Sometimes it's a question of how you organize your code, sometimes it's literally a different person writing different code. It may sound a bit abstract, but the practical effect of being able to express things cleaner is really quite profound. Also of course in reality, the objects of interest aren't cats and dogs, but complicated matrix types, or equations, or weird number types or neural networks, or something like that, but the core problem remains. You don't want the person working on neural networks to also have to know about quaternions, but you may want to put quaternions in your neural network. The expression problem ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression\\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem)) is the technical term of this extensibility difficulty.",

Part of the problem is just that it's hard to compete with efforts as well funded as Tensorflow and Pytorch. We only have a couple people actively working on this stuff. That said, I think Julia (and Flux.jl) is being used a fair amount for machine learning research (exploring new architectures, problem domains, approaches, etc.), because of its flexibility and the ease of trying new things (Flux.jl is only a few thousand lines of code, so it's easy to add new things). Because of Julia's excellent performance we also tend to to quite well in benchmarks here. The big thing that people currently don't do a lot in Julia is running big production machine learning tasks. That's mostly just because they've been tuned to hell in other systems so it's both hard to compete and even if you do, you offer little \"extra\" to convince people to switch. Our approach has always been that we want everything to be generic rather than special case tuning a few models (such that you don't fall off a performance cliff if you try something new), but as a result, things have probably taken a bit longer. That said, I'm optimistic that we will improve in this area in the very near future also. I'm working on a new AD system that should help with some of the performance problems on bigger models, and there's also work being done on memory management issues that have prevented training full batch sizes on some production models. I think it's just a matter of resolving those couple of issues, but we'll see what the future brings.",

Perhaps the most obvious of these tools at the moment are the various `@code_typed`-style introspection tools to tell you what the compiler was able to find out about your code and guide you to improving it for additional performance. There's a couple of extra ones that are less mature. I think we'll see more of that in the future. Julia is quite statically analyzable (which the compiler does for performance), so there's some very powerful tools that can be built for correctness, or paradigm adherence also. However, we really try to make sure that Julia \"doesn't get in your way\" if you're just trying to get something done and this dual approach seems to be a good way to get it done. They key is to make it integrated nicely to make sure that users actually take advantage of it. That'll be ongoing work, but I'm confident we'll be able to figure out a good way to do it.\n",

Perhaps the most obvious of these tools at the moment are the various &lt;code&gt;@code_typed&lt;/code&gt;-style introspection tools to tell you what the compiler was able to find out about your code and guide you to improving it for additional performance. There&amp;#39;s a couple of extra ones that are less mature. I think we&amp;#39;ll see more of that in the future. Julia is quite statically analyzable (which the compiler does for performance), so there&amp;#39;s some very powerful tools that can be built for correctness, or paradigm adherence also. However, we really try to make sure that Julia &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t get in your way&amp;quot; if you&amp;#39;re just trying to get something done and this dual approach seems to be a good way to get it done. They key is to make it integrated nicely to make sure that users actually take advantage of it. That&amp;#39;ll be ongoing work, but I&amp;#39;m confident we&amp;#39;ll be able to figure out a good way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Julia Computing does employ a number of julia developers, but especially if you look across the entire package ecosystem, we're but a small fraction of the total work that happens. That's not to say that no impact would be felt if Julia Computing were to go down, but I'm confident that we could find a way to fund most of the people currently being paid by Julia Computing for open source work. The company has been a very good thing for us to be able to get people working on the core julia technologies, but obviously it's a challenge to build a company where so much of what you do you give away for free. We certainly hope that we'll be able to overcome that challenge and figure out a good and sustainable way to get revenue into the company. I think it's fair to say that the faster we are able to do that, the better for avoiding the kinds of concerns that you brought up. If we can't find a way to do that, then the concerns are a bit academic anyway, since the company will probably just die. I do want to re-emphasize though that the company dying is not the same as the project dying. We've reached a point where it's very hard to see the project dying entirely. If we were to fail in trying to fund all the ideas we have for improvements, innovation in the project would probably slow down a bit, but I think with the structures we have in place, we can at least get Julia surviving indefinitely.

It felt a bit disappointing for me when I tried installing packages after the great 1.0 release and got errors.\n\nIt's a trade off. It was a bit rushed perhaps, but all things considered I think it was the right decision. Doing it at JuliaCon allowed us to achieve this milestone as a community rather than just having a few core developers tag it and call it a day. Also, actually releasing the thing made the transition to 1.0 much faster. At this point we have about the same fraction of the ecosystem working on 1.0 as we did on 0.7 a week ago and things are still going up. The dust here will be settled in a week or two, but everyone's memory of the 1.0 tagging event will last much longer. \n\n&gt;The programming paradigm of Julia, with the focus on multiple dispatch, is quite different from other, standard languages. In my experience, I found it not obvious how I should approach writing a module and making a good, reusable interface, for instance the dilemma between \"Let the user put a function in a struct and call the function as t.f(...)  \n or let the user subtype and define f(t::MyType, ...)  \n\", I'm still not sure (when) which is the right choice. As a (non-computer) scientist first, my programming skills are limited, which probably adds to my confusion, but do you know if some resources/guidelines have been developed for this kind of thing?\n\nIt takes a bit of getting used to, but often some patterns will feel natural and some won't. The easiest way to get that intuition is to play with some of the more popular julia libraries (Distributions, ColorTypes, the Images.jl stack) and see what kind of patterns they use and in what situations they do. There are a couple of guides around, but I don't think they're a substitute for gaining that intuition.\n\n&gt;How soon after the release did you discover the analogue of that typo you see right after you press send on an email: that one bad thing that could/should have been fixed but now you're stuck with it because of the stability guarantees of 1.0.\n\nI don't think we've found that yet. I'm sure we will, but we did spend a long time getting 1.0 in shape to make sure that doesn't happen. There's always bugs of course, and there was one particular regression which would have been very embarrassing to ship 1.0 with ([https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28527](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28527)), but luckily that was caught just before we were about to release and it made it into 1.0.",

The dust here will be settled in a week or two, but everyone&amp;#39;s memory of the 1.0 tagging event will last much longer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The programming paradigm of Julia, with the focus on multiple dispatch, is quite different from other, standard languages. In my experience, I found it not obvious how I should approach writing a module and making a good, reusable interface, for instance the dilemma between &amp;quot;Let the user put a function in a struct and call the function as t.f(...)&lt;br/&gt;\n or let the user subtype and define f(t::MyType, ...)&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m still not sure (when) which is the right choice. As a (non-computer) scientist first, my programming skills are limited, which probably adds to my confusion, but do you know if some resources/guidelines have been developed for this kind of thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit of getting used to, but often some patterns will feel natural and some won&amp;#39;t. The easiest way to get that intuition is to play with some of the more popular julia libraries (Distributions, ColorTypes, the Images.jl stack) and see what kind of patterns they use and in what situations they do. There are a couple of guides around, but I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re a substitute for gaining that intuition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How soon after the release did you discover the analogue of that typo you see right after you press send on an email: that one bad thing that could/should have been fixed but now you&amp;#39;re stuck with it because of the stability guarantees of 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ve found that yet. I&amp;#39;m sure we will, but we did spend a long time getting 1.0 in shape to make sure that doesn&amp;#39;t happen. There&amp;#39;s always bugs of course, and there was one particular regression which would have been very embarrassing to ship 1.0 with (&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28527\"&gt;https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28527&lt;/a&gt;), but luckily that was caught just before we were about to release and it made it into 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "&gt; Could you describe your work day? How does it look like for Language developers? For instance, Keno, what does it means to be the main developer of the Julia Compiler?\n\nI think the workday is pretty much the same as any software developer, with the primary difference being how much of the communication is done out in the open. The start of my day is usually spent catching up on GitHub issues, email, discourse, etc. Afterwards, I usually either have a long-term ongoing project (for much of the past six months that was reworking the optimizer to handle the new iteration protocol and our new missing data support) for some high-priority bug that I need to take care of. Then there's various calls and meetings. For example, every Thursday, we have a \"triage\" call, where we discuss the most urgent items that need taken care of, what things are release blocking and generally try to make decisions on things that get stuck. These calls can be quite intense (on occasion they've gone on for six hours).\n\n&gt; What's the next big decision, relating to Julia, on the table now? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nThere's lots of design decisions to be done every day, but I think the biggest upcoming area will the multi threading. We're adding support for scheduling co-routines onto multiple threads (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/22631) and to take advantage of that well, we'll have to figure out various aspects of the parallel memory and execution model.\n\n&gt; What's your second favorite Language after Julia?\n\nI don't really pick favorites, but I think there's a couple of languages we can learn things from. For example, I'd really like to do something about restricted memory ownership models (which would allow more aggressive optimizations in various cases) and the Rust people have obviously done a lot of thinking there. We can't quite copy their design, since our users have different expectations, but I'm still hoping there's something we can do there. I'm also partial to formal verification like you'd find in Coq or Idris.",

For instance, Keno, what does it means to be the main developer of the Julia Compiler?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the workday is pretty much the same as any software developer, with the primary difference being how much of the communication is done out in the open. The start of my day is usually spent catching up on GitHub issues, email, discourse, etc. Afterwards, I usually either have a long-term ongoing project (for much of the past six months that was reworking the optimizer to handle the new iteration protocol and our new missing data support) for some high-priority bug that I need to take care of. Then there&amp;#39;s various calls and meetings. For example, every Thursday, we have a &amp;quot;triage&amp;quot; call, where we discuss the most urgent items that need taken care of, what things are release blocking and generally try to make decisions on things that get stuck. These calls can be quite intense (on occasion they&amp;#39;ve gone on for six hours).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the next big decision, relating to Julia, on the table now? What are your thoughts about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s lots of design decisions to be done every day, but I think the biggest upcoming area will the multi threading. We&amp;#39;re adding support for scheduling co-routines onto multiple threads (&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/22631\"&gt;https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/22631&lt;/a&gt;) and to take advantage of that well, we&amp;#39;ll have to figure out various aspects of the parallel memory and execution model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your second favorite Language after Julia?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really pick favorites, but I think there&amp;#39;s a couple of languages we can learn things from. For example, I&amp;#39;d really like to do something about restricted memory ownership models (which would allow more aggressive optimizations in various cases) and the Rust people have obviously done a lot of thinking there. We can&amp;#39;t quite copy their design, since our users have different expectations, but I&amp;#39;m still hoping there&amp;#39;s something we can do there. I&amp;#39;m also partial to formal verification like you&amp;#39;d find in Coq or Idris.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

As such, we've seen the most uptake in academia and in industries that need to do a lot of computing (e.g. Finance).\n\nAs for how I got involved, I originally learned about this area of computing my taking Andrew Ng's ML MOOC, which was taught in Octave. Afterwards, I participated in a competition called the Mathematical Contest in Modeling ([https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/)), where you basically model a problem and write a research paper about it over the course of 96 hours. The Octave code I wrote for that (to simulate the total mass of leaves on a tree), ran fairly slow, so I had to be awake every 3 hours to check the results, add them to the paper, tweak things and kick off another run. I was already a pretty good programmer, so I considered helping out with Octave to make it go faster, but a few weeks later Julia was announced, so I decided to work on that instead. One of the fantastic things about GitHub is that everybody can contribute, independent of your level of experience, where you come from or what your background is. The Julia community is very inclusive. I'm also happy to say that I'm not the only high schooler who's taken this path with the Julia Community. E.g. Yingbo Ma, who is one of the most prolific contributors started in high school.",
