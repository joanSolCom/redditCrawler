        "selftext": " TL;DR:\n\n* We've released full opt-out from any data collection (available since the end of June)\n* Canceling our existing partnership with the research company, which means we won’t be selling aggregate anonymous data (or any data) anymore \n* Updates for our [privacy policy](https://www.overwolf.com/legal/privacy) to reflect what we actually do \n* (Added more context about [who we are](https://www.overwolf.com/about-overwolf) and [how we started](https://www.overwolf.com/our-story/) on our website)\n\nMore details:\n\nHey again everyone,\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, PoE Overlay &amp; PoE Planner launched their apps on Overwolf about a month and a half ago. This raised a lot of eyebrows (to say the least…), so we created an AMA about 2 days later to be fully transparent about our thoughts, plans and who we are:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/h123ac/hey\\_im\\_uri\\_marchand\\_ceo\\_cofounder\\_of\\_overwolf\\_ask/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/h123ac/hey_im_uri_marchand_ceo_cofounder_of_overwolf_ask/)\n\nThis AMA helped us understand your concerns &amp; needs, and generate clear action items for how we can build a better framework. Thank you soooo much for that. I promised I’d update you with the changes we did, so here it is: \n\nThe first work morning after the AMA, we sat together and decided to stop everything we do and make immediate changes to some of the points raised in your feedback. Some changes were already live about a week and a half after the AMA, and some are still in the works. \n\nFirst, opt-out from data collection. Our product team developed and released within a week and a half of these opt-out options on Overwolf: [https://imgur.com/a/8iwDS5V](https://imgur.com/a/8iwDS5V)\n\n1. You can choose at any time to opt-out of any data that is collected from your computer’s hardware. Once you choose to do so, the only place that data will be saved is local logs.\n2. You can choose if you want to share with us analytics to improve Overwolf’s client and your experience as a result. If that’s something you don’t want to do, you can opt-out of it.\n3. The last one is regarding using the Overwolf client which you cannot opt-out from. This is how we can update the apps you’re using, curate apps and send hotfixes, subscription plans, and more. Without this, Overwolf won’t be able to run. \n\nSecond, canceling our existing data partnership with NewZoo. As we’ve shared in the AMA, we had a relationship with them in which we provided them with anonymous information for research purposes (top played games, top used hardware, etc.). While this data cannot be correlated with a specific human being, we understand the concerns this community had, and our response is to sunset our relationship with them, and never sell data again. This won’t affect the sustainability of the company - our business model is predominantly based on a 30% share on ads/subs for app developers that choose to have either.  \n\nThird, our privacy policy. We did a poor job reviewing what our lawyers wrote, and as a result, there was a disconnect between our old privacy policy to what we actually do. The goal of our legal team was to cover all the legal issues that we might have with data, and from that perspective they did a pretty good job. However, we failed in properly reviewing what they wrote, so that it matches what we actually do. This is now fixed, easier to understand, and more readable. If you like, you’re welcome to check it out and give us feedback -  [https://www.overwolf.com/legal/privacy](https://www.overwolf.com/legal/privacy).\n\nLastly, we learned that we need to be clearer on who we are and why we do what we do, so we’ve updated our [About](https://www.overwolf.com/about-overwolf) page, and shared [Our Story](https://www.overwolf.com/our-story/) since starting the company. \n\nThe communication with the PoE community was an amazing learning experience for me personally, and for us @ Overwolf. I’d love to hear what you have in mind, and if you have other ideas on how we can provide you a better service. \n\nThank you all very much.\n\nUri",

Yesterday, we announced that CurseForge is joining the Overwolf pack. With this, Overwolf is expanding its home for in-game apps to include game mods as well. More about us:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.overwolf.com/about-overwolf\"&gt;https://www.overwolf.com/about-overwolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As gamers, with League of Legends and World of Warcraft being the most played games in the office, we’re honored for the opportunity of working with the CurseForge community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CurseForge will remain a standalone brand, within the Overwolf family of apps. The transition away from the Twitch client will happen gradually - we want to tread carefully here, respecting what you all know and love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To read more:  &lt;a href=\"https://curseforge.overwolf.com/\"&gt;https://curseforge.overwolf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Medium post: &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/overwolf-developers/a-new-home-for-curseforge-44cbb3add844\"&gt;https://medium.com/overwolf-developers/a-new-home-for-curseforge-44cbb3add844&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here today we have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/DMF_overwolf\"&gt;u/DMF_overwolf&lt;/a&gt; (GM of Mods &amp;amp; a WoW Player), &lt;a href=\"/u/yanco77\"&gt;u/yanco77&lt;/a&gt; (VP Product), &lt;a href=\"/u/tsavner\"&gt;u/tsavner&lt;/a&gt; (VP Business Development), &lt;a href=\"/u/Overwolf_Shai\"&gt;u/Overwolf_Shai&lt;/a&gt; (Software Engineer), &lt;a href=\"/u/gal1231\"&gt;u/gal1231&lt;/a&gt; (Community Manager), &lt;a href=\"/u/chriskatey\"&gt;u/chriskatey&lt;/a&gt; (Support &amp;amp; a WoW main Hunter player &lt;a href=\"https://raider.io/characters/eu/the-maelstrom/Lainly\"&gt;https://raider.io/characters/eu/the-maelstrom/Lainly&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof:  &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheOverwolf/status/1275470437460344833\"&gt;https://twitter.com/TheOverwolf/status/1275470437460344833&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will start answering your questions at 10am PST and we&amp;#39;ll be around for about 2 hours.

In our first work day after this AMA we’ve started focusing on addressing your feedback\n2. 11 days in, I’m happy to update that we’re now allowing opting out from data collection &amp; analytics. This is now relevant for fresh installs (all of the users will gradually get this patch in the next couple of days) Reference: https://imgur.com/a/pqVPVg6\n3. We've also updated our website, Terms of Use and Privacy Policy to reflect what we really do, and not what some lawyer wrote (and clearly we did a poor job reviewing)\n4. Thanks again everybody, you guys have done a great job mirroring some blind spots. We’re here to listen and act. You can always DM or email me to uri dot marchand at Overwolf dot com\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* EDIT \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n1. We're close to 6 hours in, it's almost 1am here and I'm off to bed. Did my best to answer everyone \n2. I want to thank this community for a great learning experience. I admire the passion you guys have for the game, data, ads, creators, apps and anything in between\n3. Our next steps are described in my comments below, but the TL;DR: 1. Allowing opt-out from all analytics &amp; data. 2. Updating our terms and privacy policy where applicable 3. letting you guys know when this and the items below are done. \n\nThank you all and good night",

This is now relevant for fresh installs (all of the users will gradually get this patch in the next couple of days) Reference: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/pqVPVg6\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/pqVPVg6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;ve also updated our website, Terms of Use and Privacy Policy to reflect what we really do, and not what some lawyer wrote (and clearly we did a poor job reviewing)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thanks again everybody, you guys have done a great job mirroring some blind spots. We’re here to listen and act. You can always DM or email me to uri dot marchand at Overwolf dot com&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;******* EDIT ******* &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;re close to 6 hours in, it&amp;#39;s almost 1am here and I&amp;#39;m off to bed. Did my best to answer everyone &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I want to thank this community for a great learning experience. I admire the passion you guys have for the game, data, ads, creators, apps and anything in between&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our next steps are described in my comments below, but the TL;DR: 1. Allowing opt-out from all analytics &amp;amp; data. 2. Updating our terms and privacy policy where applicable 3. letting you guys know when this and the items below are done. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all and good night&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
