Glad to hear you are thinking/pondering about your adult life already.\n\nHealthcare is one of those important things that everyone will need and should be able to find easy access to it.  Truth is the healthcare plans currently are not great but they do suffice until further changes are created by government etc in the coming decade.  By the time you reach your twenties it‚Äôs possible better healthcare options will become available to you.\n\nAs a game designer, you might choose to work for a large or small gaming company, in that case usually your employer will be the one offering you health insurance.  If you work on your own as a self employed game designer then you‚Äôll shop for your own individual healthcare plan.\n\nA good thing for you to start thinking about:\n- starting a savings account \n- beginning a Roth IRA (this is where you save for retirement tax free growth)\n- most importantly, work on your game designing knowledge and skills... this is what‚Äôs going to help you get into a career you‚Äôll really love to be in and by being great at your specialty all the money and nice things will soon follow.\n\nüëç",

Feel free to check it out or email me.  The investments are held at Fidelity Investments and can be linked up to your checking for easy contributions etc.\n\nSince your savings will be in a taxable account, there will be some minor capital gains taxes each year but you'll also have full access to your investment funds since it wont be an actual retirement account.\n\nThanks!\n\n[https://fmf365.com/](https://fmf365.com/)\n\nJust click the Start Here and there's very useful interactive tool to guide you through the process.",
