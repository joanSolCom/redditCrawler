I'm back to answer some more questions and to let you know that I'm involved in a campaign to sell some #DammitJerry t'shirts/hoodies/mugs to support the #TuberousSclerosisAlliance.  This organization helps children born with tumors on their organs who very sadly end up having numerous seizures throughout the day for most of their lives.  It's a wonderful group of people and I'm always happy to do anything I can to help this awesome cause.  Please go to www.Represent.com/Jim and get your #DammitJerry swag.  :)  Now, bring on the questions.  :)\n\n\n\nWell, I've gotta get ready for my FB Live with Josh McDermott.  We'll be live at 3PM PST.  Please check us out and ask whatever questions you might have.  I'll also be with Andrew J. West at the Laemmle's on Wilshire in Beverly Hills at 7:30pm for the screening of Middle Man.  Go to their website for tix.  We'll be doing a Q&amp;A after the film.\n\nI want to thank you all for taking the time to either ask questions or check out the answers.  I love doing these kind of things.  I think they're much more revealing than your average interview.  REDDIT is one of the greatest places for information about ... anything.  Literally anything.  \n\nI'm heading to Boston tomorrow to go to the 7:30pm screening of Middle Man at the Boston Common 19 on Tremont Street.  I'll also by in NYC on Tuesday at the Empire Theater on 42nd to meet people at the 7:30pm (I think...if not around that time) where we'll also be doing a Q&amp;A with me and director Ned Crowley.\n\nPlease check me out on The Late Late Show with Seth Meyers next Wednesday, the 14th.  Seth is one of the really good guys.  I love being on his show.\n\nAgain, thank you for all the great questions and taking the time out to spend with me.  I'm forever astounded and grateful for the love I'm shown every day.\n\nxoxoxo\nJim\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 1: Hey everyone.  I have to do a phone interview at 11 PST.  I'll be back after we hang up.  In the mean time check out the trailer for Middle Man.  I promise you a thrilling, dark, funny ride with this film:\n\nhttp://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/\n\nHey Reddit! \nThank you for having me back! I think this is going to be my third AMA, so the answers should hopefully come a little faster this time. I have a new independent film called \"Middle Man\"  which is opening in theaters today. It's a super dark comedy that I'm extremely proud of. It's been on the festival circuit (and has done very well!) so I'm sure a few people here may have already seen it. If so, no spoilers! Lol. \n\nIn the film, I play a comedian named Lenny. When Lenny's mother suddenly dies, he quits his job and heads to Vegas in search of fame. He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result – as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.\n\nHere's a link to the trailer. I hope you like it! http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/\n\nHere's me and my doggos for \"proof\"  http://imgur.com/a/4Ti7B\n\nI will be back in about two hours to answer your questions.\nThanks Reddit!",
