When it comes to industry, he's saying things like, \"Hey Detroit, under me the government will buy all the electric cars you make!\" but he's not talking about approaching automakers in the US as a large investor with the goal of getting them to convert to EVs. He should do that. But he won't do that because he and his advisors are shy of \"getting the government involved directly in industry.\"  \n\n(2) I'm skeptical of whether even with the Senate and a big House majority that Biden would have done a big Infrastructure thing. But without the Senate, there's no change. The Rs won't allow him a victory.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that we probably need a new party to run on a vision of a massively more prosperous America because (1) that's the only way to win big majorities in the Senate &amp; House; and (2) because the Dems will never run on that. They will keep trying to play it down the middle. \n\nAgain: I'n not talking about  left vs right. I don't think Dems or a new party would win by taking \"far left\" (whatever that is) positions that most, or half of, Americans don't support. I'm talking about running on a plan build up the economy all across the country in every community. Trump won in 2016 partly because he pretended to support this idea.

The local mall has been filled with images celebrating gay rights and explicitly trans rights every Pride month for the past few years. Kids in elementary schools all around here are coming out as transgender. Of course, there's still a lot of hostility from some people, but it's become mainstream. Several years ago a trans bathroom ballot measure (the situation is too complicated to explain here) lost by just a few votes in Springfield, MO. Many Christian churches were supporting trans rights publicly in the vote. \n\nWhen Dems feel like they must support something like \"defund the police\" to keep their primary voters -- well, that is just like when Rs have to take crazy right wing positions for the same reason. \n\nI'm proposing a new party where we won't do that. It doesn't mean we'll shy away from positions that will take some explaining and persuasion. But it means we won't adopt the slogans of some small factions like \"defund the police\" just to win points with the cool kids. We would say, \"Well, we definitely need to stop funding police to buy tanks, but if anything police need more funding for better training and new staff that better represent the communities they serve. AND we need to fund social services far better than we do now to restore what's been cut over the past several decades.\"\n\nBut to be clear \"defund the police\" is a genius slogan for the people who are using it in the streets -- because it gets into the media, and it it gets police officials listening. The way to actually fix things is for practical leaders to use the space that is opened up by that slogan to implement real solutions.",

Kids in elementary schools all around here are coming out as transgender. Of course, there&amp;#39;s still a lot of hostility from some people, but it&amp;#39;s become mainstream. Several years ago a trans bathroom ballot measure (the situation is too complicated to explain here) lost by just a few votes in Springfield, MO. Many Christian churches were supporting trans rights publicly in the vote. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Dems feel like they must support something like &amp;quot;defund the police&amp;quot; to keep their primary voters -- well, that is just like when Rs have to take crazy right wing positions for the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m proposing a new party where we won&amp;#39;t do that. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean we&amp;#39;ll shy away from positions that will take some explaining and persuasion. But it means we won&amp;#39;t adopt the slogans of some small factions like &amp;quot;defund the police&amp;quot; just to win points with the cool kids. We would say, &amp;quot;Well, we definitely need to stop funding police to buy tanks, but if anything police need more funding for better training and new staff that better represent the communities they serve. AND we need to fund social services far better than we do now to restore what&amp;#39;s been cut over the past several decades.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to be clear &amp;quot;defund the police&amp;quot; is a genius slogan for the people who are using it in the streets -- because it gets into the media, and it it gets police officials listening. The way to actually fix things is for practical leaders to use the space that is opened up by that slogan to implement real solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
