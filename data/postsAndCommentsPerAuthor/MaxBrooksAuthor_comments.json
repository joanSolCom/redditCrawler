The big question for me, has always been, how do you teach the big, scary, confusing, uncomfortable facts that we, as voters, need to hear? How do we learn without being bored to sleep, or scared out of the room? As a society, we used to be really good at fusing education with entertainment. We seem to have lost that. I think monster stories can teach us so much about real world problems, the way JAWS taught us about short term greed vs public safety (I'm lookin at you, COVID!). I try to write about fictional threats with factual solutions, no silver bullet, no single hero. Fictional stories about adapting to new situations. That always fascinates me.",

The big question for me, has always been, how do you teach the big, scary, confusing, uncomfortable facts that we, as voters, need to hear? How do we learn without being bored to sleep, or scared out of the room? As a society, we used to be really good at fusing education with entertainment. We seem to have lost that. I think monster stories can teach us so much about real world problems, the way JAWS taught us about short term greed vs public safety (I&amp;#39;m lookin at you, COVID!). I try to write about fictional threats with factual solutions, no silver bullet, no single hero. Fictional stories about adapting to new situations. That always fascinates me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If seen through the right lens, I think Minecraft has the potential to teach kids the kind of mental survival skills they're going to need for the world we live in. \n\nAs far as the right course of action for a quarantine: I think we need to act on what the actionable intel teaches us. Right now, in the USA, we are getting sucker-punched because we didn't have enough test-kits ready to go. We can't counter the virus if we don't know where it is. Proper testing, like they are doing in South Korea would not only help us get a handle on how to effectively respond, it would also do so much to reduce the anxiety we are all feeling right now. The best way to stop mass panic is to get a clear picture of the situation.",

If seen through the right lens, I think Minecraft has the potential to teach kids the kind of mental survival skills they&amp;#39;re going to need for the world we live in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as the right course of action for a quarantine: I think we need to act on what the actionable intel teaches us. Right now, in the USA, we are getting sucker-punched because we didn&amp;#39;t have enough test-kits ready to go. We can&amp;#39;t counter the virus if we don&amp;#39;t know where it is. Proper testing, like they are doing in South Korea would not only help us get a handle on how to effectively respond, it would also do so much to reduce the anxiety we are all feeling right now. The best way to stop mass panic is to get a clear picture of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But trying to turn that lore into a reasonable, workable, scientifically based story took a few more years. Sometimes I got lucky, like when I learned that real chimps throw rocks. That made the Fred Beck story more credible. Watching real chimps tear monkeys apart also justified the graphic violence in the book. That's not gratuitous, that's not for show. Anyone who thinks I put those scenes in for a cheap thrill should check out videos of chimpanzees hunting colobus monkeys.",
