Pricing, on the other hand, is a little tricky. Life insurance prices have been at all time lows and so far we haven't seen a prince increase related to the pandemic. That said, a change in pricing is probably more likely to happen than increased demand for med exams. Once COVID-19 tests become more readily available, don't be surprised if insurers begin asking about COVID-19 history, or ask customers to take a test (especially if they've recently traveled).\n\nRight now when insurers call to confirm the appointment they are already asking if the potential insured has been exposed or potentially exposed to anyone that has tested positive for COVID and if the answer is yes, they are delaying the exam by a few weeks.",

Right now it&amp;#39;s too soon to say, but we don&amp;#39;t think we will see an increase in demand for medical exams. Most policies already require one. Pricing, on the other hand, is a little tricky. Life insurance prices have been at all time lows and so far we haven&amp;#39;t seen a prince increase related to the pandemic. That said, a change in pricing is probably more likely to happen than increased demand for med exams. Once COVID-19 tests become more readily available, don&amp;#39;t be surprised if insurers begin asking about COVID-19 history, or ask customers to take a test (especially if they&amp;#39;ve recently traveled).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now when insurers call to confirm the appointment they are already asking if the potential insured has been exposed or potentially exposed to anyone that has tested positive for COVID and if the answer is yes, they are delaying the exam by a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "**TL;DR:** *Yes, file a renters insurance claim. You should be eligible for reimbursement for any damaged personal property. You could potentially file a loss-of-use claim too, and your renters policy will pay for you to stay somewhere else while your home is being repaired. Your insurance company will then contact the at-fault party (your neighbor or landlord) to try and recoup their losses from your claim. This is called subrogation. Essentially, your insurance company will contact your neighbor’s insurance company to try and get some money back.*\n\nI’m sorry this happened! Renters insurance can be tricky when it comes to water damage, but water damage from sprinklers is usually a covered peril. Did any of your personal belongings get damaged? If so, you can file a personal property renters insurance claim.\n\nAs for the apartment being loud and generally unlivable, you might be able to file a loss-of-use claim with your renters insurance, and they will pay for you to temporarily stay elsewhere, like a nearby hotel. This coverage also pays for any additional living expenses, so if you are eating at restaurants more because you no longer have a usable kitchen, your loss-of-use coverage should reimburse you for those meals. Make sure to keep your receipts. \n\nIf your insurance company agrees to pay you out for your claim, then your insurance company is going to try to recoup their loss from the at-fault party. This process is called subrogation — it’s the legal right your renters insurance company has to try and recover their loss. Basically, your renters insurance company is going to try and get their money back from the at-fault party. Your neighbors renters insurance liability coverage will cover this cost.\n\nIf you need more info we have an article outlining this exact kind of incident — you can read it here: [https://www.policygenius.com/renters-insurance/neighbor-flooded-apartment-renters-insurance/](https://www.policygenius.com/renters-insurance/neighbor-flooded-apartment-renters-insurance/)\n\n*Source: I am not a licensed insurance agent.

If you lease, most auto insurance companies will require you to get comprehensive and collision insurance - comprehensive car insurance includes damage to the car that happens when it’s not being driven  (in your case damage from windstorm and falling objects).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was anything else damaged that belonged to you? If so, you could potentially file a renters insurance claim, as renters insurance does cover windstorms and falling objects that damage your personal belongings. If any of your personal property was inside your truck, your renters insurance can also cover that, just not the truck itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your landlord will have their own insurance to cover the building and their own liability. If the latch was old and rusted and therefore loose, you might be able to prove this happened because of their negligence. If you can prove this, then they should be able to file a liability claim with their insurance company to reimburse you for at least some of the loss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: I am not a licensed insurance agent.

As others in this thread have said, employer-sponsored life insurance isn't portable, so if you lose your job, you lose coverage (or have to buy your own coverage at a higher rate than you'd pay now). And if you include your employer coverage in your calculation now and you get laid off or leave your job, all of your numbers will be off.  \n\nYour best option is figuring out how much life insurance coverage you need and shopping for that amount. Treat your workplace policy as bonus coverage rather than something your family would have to rely on to make ends meet. Don't be scared to buy more than you absolutely need if you are young and healthy - this is the cheapest it will ever be for you, and better to \"grow\" into the coverage if you end up having more kids than realize you're lacking.  \n\nOne last point: Rather than using a straight income multiplier to figure out your coverage, you're probably better off with a needs-based approach — adding up all your debts, ball-parking potential future costs (like college tuition for kids), and subtracting your existing assets — to get a more accurate picture of how big a policy you’ll need.
