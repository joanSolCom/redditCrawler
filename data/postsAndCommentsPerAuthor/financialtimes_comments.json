And of course, if second waves do materialise, many of what we think are totals may turn out not to be.  \n\n\nHaving said all of that, it does seem clear from the magnitudes of both official and particularly excess deaths that the UK has suffered one of the highest mortality rates in the world during its outbreak, BUT...  \n\n\nGiven different countries have faced their outbreaks in very different contexts (sparse vs dense populations, dozens of widely spread initial infection seeds vs one or two in one location), I think the more *useful* comparison for any given country is not to its neighbours and peers, but to its own counterfactual. What if country x had managed to reduce its transmission rate earlier than it did? Was country y’s policy reasonable given what data showed at the time? etc  \n\n\nI realise that’s a very meandering answer to a very specific question, but hopefully some useful stuff in amidst the rambling...",

And of course, if second waves do materialise, many of what we think are totals may turn out not to be.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having said all of that, it does seem clear from the magnitudes of both official and particularly excess deaths that the UK has suffered one of the highest mortality rates in the world during its outbreak, BUT...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given different countries have faced their outbreaks in very different contexts (sparse vs dense populations, dozens of widely spread initial infection seeds vs one or two in one location), I think the more &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; comparison for any given country is not to its neighbours and peers, but to its own counterfactual. What if country x had managed to reduce its transmission rate earlier than it did? Was country y’s policy reasonable given what data showed at the time? etc  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realise that’s a very meandering answer to a very specific question, but hopefully some useful stuff in amidst the rambling...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There has been a fear among regulators and investors that an economic downturn will result in a swathe of downgrades, sending debt tumbling from \"investment-grade\" into \"high-yield\". This is problematic because the investment grade universe is just much bigger than high-yield, so with fewer investors to buy debt after a company has been downgraded, borrowing costs tend to rise, and could accelerate a downturn. Taking Ford specifically, as I wrote about that downgrade this week, this was the one everyone was waiting for. Ford's bond yields had already risen significantly on expectations it would downgraded. But there aren't many other companies on the precipice of being downgraded with the same amount of debt as Ford. Instead, what's more likely is a raft of smaller companies being downgraded. Bank of America estimate that, including ford, there will be about $200bn downgraded from investment grade into high yield. That's a lot but may not be unmanagable. Nonetheless, it doesn't mean there aren't risks facing corporate credit right now. There are. As I have noted in other replies. ",

In short, the risk is high. The global economy is currently on lockdown. With people staying home, not flying, not going to the cinema, not going to shops, not staying in hotels, etc etc, a lot of companies have come under pressure. As revenues decline - with first quarter earnings expected to show a sharp decline - the available cash to pay off debt declines. In response to this, companies have rushed to secure credit - borrowing from banks and selling bonds to investors. This also signals to investors that a company is healthy and will be able to weather the storm. The problem is that the companies facing real risk have been broadly cut off from capital markets. As corona drags on, it's like these companies will be downgraded by ratings agencies and eventually default. In a worst case scenario, with the current shutdown dragging on economic growth into the second half of the year, Moody's said today that the default rate of riskier, high-yield companies could hit 18 per cent, well above the roughly 13 per cent seen in 2008. ",

I’ve long felt that there’s a problem with how people are exposed to statistics and particularly charts at school/college, compared to how we’re exposed to words.  \n\n\nRelatively early on in school we learn to critically analyse text; to think about the author’s intent, about how different wording/phrasing can elicit a different response etc. In other words, we’re all very familiar with the idea that the written word can be misleading.  \n\n\nBut for most people, especially those who don’t study maths/science after it stops being compulsory, your only exposure to charts at school is as \"the results\". \"A chart showing X\" etc. People are essentially conditioned into thinking words = subjective, charts = objective.  \n\n\nNow, as a data visualisation practitioner, that’s a pretty powerful thing to be able to lean on! But as you point out, it’s also increasingly problematic, and the proliferation of charts and data in the media and life more generally is opening people’s eyes to the fact that they can be just as subjective, as agenda-driven, as the written word.  \n\n\nTo be clear, I think this realisation that data and charts can mislead is a very good thing, and I think it would be great if people were taught to critically evaluate charts early on in school.  \n\n\nTo your latter question about increasing trust in data/charts/statistics, I think this is a more holistic question of fostering trust *in general*. There’s research \\[[https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/data-is-personal-what-we-learned-from-42-interviews-in-rural-america-93539f25836d](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/data-is-personal-what-we-learned-from-42-interviews-in-rural-america-93539f25836d)\\] showing that people’s trust in charts/numbers comes down to who made the chart, or who is showing them the chart, more than the chart and its contents per se, so I think the lesson for any individual or organisation putting out data and charts is to work to establish trust much more generally, and the rewards of that will be seen in people’s trust in statistics as well as in other forms of information.  \n\n\nThat being said, there are some specific things people/orgs can do to increase trust in data/charts, most of which come down to communication/transparency:  \n• Be up-front about the decisions made in choosing what data you analysed and visualised (and what data you didn’t)  \n• Acknowledge other possible interpretations of the data as well as the one(s) you’re showing/highlighting  \n• Ask for feedback! If you can turn the publication of a chart or dataset into a two-way conversation, not a simple 'broadcast', that goes a huge way to establish trust in what you’re showing and what you’re doing",

Comparing the total numbers of people dying this year vs the same weeks in previous years is much less subject to methodological idiosyncrasies than other measures such as daily reported deaths, so in using this metric we can be  lot more confident that we’re comparing true, comprehensive and compatible numbers between countries. That said, there can still be issues:  \n1) Spain revised its all-cause mortality numbers a couple of weeks ago, retrospectively adding 12,000 deaths in one go. This goes to show that death registration systems are being overwhelmed even in some wealthy, developed countries, so we can’t consider mortality counts to be final.  \n2) Different countries are at different stages of their outbreaks, so we need to be aware that we might be comparing one total to one partial figure. And of course, if second waves do materialise, many of what we think are totals may turn out not to be.  \n\n\nHaving said all of that, it does seem clear from the magnitudes of both official and particularly excess deaths that the UK has suffered one of the highest mortality rates in the world during its outbreak, BUT...  \n\n\nGiven different countries have faced their outbreaks in very different contexts (sparse vs dense populations, dozens of widely spread initial infection seeds vs one or two in one location), I think the more *useful* comparison for any given country is not to its neighbours and peers, but to its own counterfactual.

There has been a fear among regulators and investors that an economic downturn will result in a swathe of downgrades, sending debt tumbling from \"investment-grade\" into \"high-yield\". This is problematic because the investment grade universe is just much bigger than high-yield, so with fewer investors to buy debt after a company has been downgraded, borrowing costs tend to rise, and could accelerate a downturn. Taking Ford specifically, as I wrote about that downgrade this week, this was the one everyone was waiting for. Ford's bond yields had already risen significantly on expectations it would downgraded. But there aren't many other companies on the precipice of being downgraded with the same amount of debt as Ford. Instead, what's more likely is a raft of smaller companies being downgraded. Bank of America estimate that, including ford, there will be about $200bn downgraded from investment grade into high yield. That's a lot but may not be unmanagable.

Every other option will create even more upheaval. \n\nI think striking a new deal is the most likely scenario, but I am not sure whether it will get through parliament.

There is no escape, especially for those of who us to wake up, spent of ours and go to sleep thinking about Brexit. Most normal folks I speak to want it to go away - either by walking away from the EU or staying in. Downing Street are betting on this attitude to see through their strategy of leaving, come what may, on October 31. The country has done or talked about little else for three years now, it is exhausting. \n\nIf the UK leaves the EU, rejoining will take a generational shift. The UK will not be able to rejoin on its current preferable terms, so going back in would likely mean signing up to the euro and joining Schengen. Both of these terms are unacceptable to a majority of Brits right now. Only if there is a big shift in political opinion can rejoining the EU as full members become a possibility.",

There is no escape, especially for those of who us to wake up, spent of ours and go to sleep thinking about Brexit. Most normal folks I speak to want it to go away - either by walking away from the EU or staying in. Downing Street are betting on this attitude to see through their strategy of leaving, come what may, on October 31. The country has done or talked about little else for three years now, it is exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the UK leaves the EU, rejoining will take a generational shift. The UK will not be able to rejoin on its current preferable terms, so going back in would likely mean signing up to the euro and joining Schengen. Both of these terms are unacceptable to a majority of Brits right now. Only if there is a big shift in political opinion can rejoining the EU as full members become a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Quite a few questions on why this murder had so much impact. As background, Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist who has worked, for most of his career, for Saudi government publications. He was also an advisor to a senior prince. So he was not only prominent in the kingdom but also part of the family. He went into exile because he felt that the regime under Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, had become even more repressive than previous leaderships. He was not only told what he could not write but asked to write in support of the prince's policies, even when he disagreed with them. In the US, Khashoggi was writing columns for the Washington Post.\n\nWhy did his killing get so much attention? First, because he was well known in political and media circles in the west. Second, because his insights into Saudi Arabia were appreciated. Third, he was writing for a leading US publication. Fourth, because the murder happened in Turkey and many in the Turkish government knew Khashoggi. Finally, because of the gruesome nature of the murder. ",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a few questions on why this murder had so much impact. As background, Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist who has worked, for most of his career, for Saudi government publications. He was also an advisor to a senior prince. So he was not only prominent in the kingdom but also part of the family. He went into exile because he felt that the regime under Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, had become even more repressive than previous leaderships. He was not only told what he could not write but asked to write in support of the prince&amp;#39;s policies, even when he disagreed with them. In the US, Khashoggi was writing columns for the Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did his killing get so much attention? First, because he was well known in political and media circles in the west. Second, because his insights into Saudi Arabia were appreciated. Third, he was writing for a leading US publication. Fourth, because the murder happened in Turkey and many in the Turkish government knew Khashoggi. Finally, because of the gruesome nature of the murder. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The option of raising tariffs should have been used if and only if it became obvious that China would not co-operate. \n\nThe argument the US should have made was that the deal reached in 2001, when China rejoined the WTO, was sensible at the time and indeed required a huge amount of liberalization from China. But that deal is now out of date, since China has become an economic superpower. So it is time to renegotiate the deal, within the WTO. The new deal must recognize the vast changes in China’s positions since then, including its new leadership role. It can no longer hide behind its putative status as a “developing country” even though it remains quite poor, because it is so large.\n\nI think this sort of argument, put forward inside the WTO, would have made it far more difficult for the Chinese to resist making changes in their policies. It would certainly have put more pressure upon it.\n\nWalking out of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) was also a big mistake, since the TPP was actually designed to marginalise China. By leaving the TPP, the US greatly undermined its own trustworthiness to its actual and potential allies in the Asian region. This of course strengthened China's position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The new deal must recognize the vast changes in China’s positions since then, including its new leadership role. It can no longer hide behind its putative status as a “developing country” even though it remains quite poor, because it is so large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this sort of argument, put forward inside the WTO, would have made it far more difficult for the Chinese to resist making changes in their policies. It would certainly have put more pressure upon it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walking out of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) was also a big mistake, since the TPP was actually designed to marginalise China. By leaving the TPP, the US greatly undermined its own trustworthiness to its actual and potential allies in the Asian region. This of course strengthened China&amp;#39;s position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I was fortunate in that I moved from print to web early on in my career and was consequently always hungry to learn new techniques. However, it&amp;#39;s only really in the past 4 years that I have seen the benefit of using GIS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;QGIS has made a vast difference to how we create maps, gone are the days of tracing maps in Illustrator, time-consuming and not particularly accurate. Being able to join data to maps instantly, frees up time to spend on visual presentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today’s mapmakers have data at our fingertips. We are able to create engaging maps at speed — crucial in a fast-paced newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
