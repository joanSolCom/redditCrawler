Because of that experience I have tried to be really intentional with my friends who do not have children. I think it requires a lot of intentionality, because as parents your lives get so busy that socialization ends up happening in the margins. On the soccer field sidelines or at a party planned for kids, etc. \n\nI have many friendships with child-free women and I really love it, because I feel like those friendships are more focused on things outside of kids and tend to go a little deeper. I value them so much, but I do have to be mindful of making sure to make that space, and also including them in things where kids are present and making sure they know they are invited and included.\n\nOne other thing that has helped me in this is being divorced, because some of that alienation also happens to divorced people. You don't get invited because it's all couples, etc. My friendship circle now includes single parents, same-sex couples, and friends without kids, and I think it's lovely to have that variance in a friend group, instead of it just being a group of same-sex two-parent couples.",

Especially around celebrations and feeling like every holiday or birthday party needs to be &amp;quot;pinterest-worthy.&amp;quot; I would be curious to hear what you guys think . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
