If you imagine that COVID infection starts on day one, the patient may be asymptomatic or they may have some mild symptoms such as cough or fever, or they may lose sense of taste/small or have a headache/myalgia. The issue for us is that 7-10 days, a very small minority get COVID pneumonia. The response to COVID pneumonia is that the lungs get very inflamed, and as a result of that inflammation, the cytokines (hormone messages) tell the liver to produce a lot more clotting factors, and so the blood gets very sticky. That, and the fact that they’re sick they are very immobile, and that COVID can also infect the lining of the blood vessels, means that those patients have a high risk of all sorts of thrombosis. It also affects the heart muscle too—people can get myocarditis—but this is really only in a minority.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyone with COVID pneumonia will have very sticky blood. The international trend is to give them all blood thinners. Data from China very early on shows that this reduced mortality. The question at the moment is: What is the best dose of blood thinners to give patients who are sick with COVID-19 pneumonia? Too much, and they might bleed. Too little, and they might thrombose. There are big clinical trials going on to answer those questions.",

Now, doctors in hospitals are giving these patients small doses of blood thinners. For the moment, I don’t think there is any point in taking blood thinners if you do not have COVID or you get COVID and have very mild symptoms and stay mobile. If you get COVID pneumonia, then hopefully the hospitals in Japan will use blood thinners. Best of luck.",

Can I remind you that the risk of clots is mainly associated with severe COVID-19, which only affects about 5% of those who get COVID-19. Now, doctors in hospitals are giving these patients small doses of blood thinners. For the moment, I don’t think there is any point in taking blood thinners if you do not have COVID or you get COVID and have very mild symptoms and stay mobile. If you get COVID pneumonia, then hopefully the hospitals in Japan will use blood thinners. Best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Really it’s about education here and it’s a topic that’s becoming increasingly popular in the clinical and research communities. I think you’ll see better awareness in healthcare providers about this issue. Like I said in another answer: you can’t be afraid to ask questions to your provider.

With this type of research, all doctors including male doctors, will be exposed tot his information in a better way so that they can understand. Really it’s about education here and it’s a topic that’s becoming increasingly popular in the clinical and research communities. I think you’ll see better awareness in healthcare providers about this issue. Like I said in another answer: you can’t be afraid to ask questions to your provider. You should ask whether trying a different medication might improve the symptoms. The ISTH, which is the scientific organization that organizes World Thrombosis Day, has an entire committee of scientists that is devoted to understanding women’s issues in blood disorders. I know they are working on questions like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Usually if you can attribute the pain to something like exercise, then you don’t need to worry too much about a blood clot. In general, what I tell people, if there’s something than what they usually experience, that’s when they should be concerned. Even though you’re an athlete, it doesn’t mean you’re immune from clots, so it is right to pay attention. I can give you an example: Athletes are more prone to injuries like sprained ankles or need injuries or maybe even broken bones, and those kinds of injuries raise the risk of clots. The worse the injury, the worse the risk. So if you do get an orthopedic injury, you have an increased risk of clots while you’re healing, so you do need to pay attention to the symptoms.

The main symptoms are leg swelling, pain, discoloration – when it’s a blood clot in the leg. Shortness of breath and chest pain are symptoms when there’s a blood clot in the lung. If you are having these symptoms, YOU CANNOT IGNORE IT. For pulmonary embolus (blood clots in the lung) about 1 in 10 people die, so it’s important to get treated early.

We had just done a study that showed obesity was a risk factor and that taller people are at higher risk for VTE than shorter people. One of the kids raised their hand and said, “Dr. Cushman, do giraffes get blood clots?” And being that I’m not a veterinarian, I had no idea how to answer the question, but I told them that I would do some research and get back to them. I went home, got out Dr. Google, and found a veterinary textbook and it’s so cool what I learned. Think of a giraffe in your mind: they have these tall legs. It turns out that is sort of the same as wearing a compression sock. They are having compression of tehri veins by the tightness of the tissue in the leg. That helps to prevent them from getting clots. The other thing is that inside of their veins, they have a lot more valves inside the veins that we have. The valves I their veins help you to push blood up against gravity. So, it turns out, that giraffes don’t get blood clots, and it’s because of their anatomy. They have skinny, muscular legs and veins that have lots of valves.",

It’s really important to be sure, if you have heart disease already, that you’re taking all t he needed treatments to prevent second events such as a second heart attack or a stroke. Being on blood pressure medicine, being on a statin, and having a healthy lifestyle are a few examples. We know a lot of people who are heart patients stop their medications because they don’t understand how important they are. They are critically important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I think that what we have to do is imagine a clot has broken off and it’s gone around and come into the pulmonary artery.

But if it’s a blood clot , it can break off and block the peripheral artery… I don’t think it depends on the cause of the clot. It’s more dependent on how firm the clot is. \n\nThe next consideration is HRT. I’m so frustrated by these questions sometimes because we have two types of HRT. Tablet HRT, which has estrogen in it, which makes your blood sticky and is associated with risk. Then we also have patch HRT, which does not increase clot risk. If you are worried about the risk of clots with HRT, we recommend transdermal HRT. Thanks for the great question!",

So you’re going to have an increased risk of bleeding. This is the main issue about being on NSAIDs. The other side issue is that they will increase your risk of having a stomach ulcer. So not only do you have increased risk, but the non-steroidals may be preparing a hole for someone to bleed from. I’m really sorry you need to take non-steroidals with anticoagulants. I would see your own personal physician to discuss your own personal risks.",

So if we think about a heart attack, it’s when you get a clot in an artery in your heart, and the brain, blocks . We’ve got venous clots, which are clots in the veins, and are usually ini the deep veins of the legs, but they don’t cause damage in the same way. As the clot grows, it can break off, travel through the body and block the blood supply to the lungs, which is called a pulmonary embolism. A DVT can be pain and sometimes change of color in the leg. A PE can be pain, shortness of breath, sometimes cough, sometimes people cough of blood. As a doctor, I always teach other doctors- I remind them off, if you have unexplained chest symptoms, it could be a PE, and need to think about that in their diagnosis.",

If you imagine that COVID infection starts on day one, the patient may be asymptomatic or they may have some mild symptoms such as cough or fever, or they may lose sense of taste/small or have a headache/myalgia. The issue for us is that 7-10 days, a very small minority get COVID pneumonia. The response to COVID pneumonia is that the lungs get very inflamed, and as a result of that inflammation, the cytokines (hormone messages) tell the liver to produce a lot more clotting factors, and so the blood gets very sticky. That, and the fact that they’re sick they are very immobile, and that COVID can also infect the lining of the blood vessels, means that those patients have a high risk of all sorts of thrombosis. It also affects the heart muscle too—people can get myocarditis—but this is really only in a minority.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyone with COVID pneumonia will have very sticky blood. The international trend is to give them all blood thinners. Data from China very early on shows that this reduced mortality. The question at the moment is: What is the best dose of blood thinners to give patients who are sick with COVID-19 pneumonia? Too much, and they might bleed. Too little, and they might thrombose. There are big clinical trials going on to answer those questions.",

The thing to do on something like a long haul flight or prolonged sitting, is to get up or (if you can’t get up) do armchair aerobics.

        "body": "Because you exercise a lot, you have a lower risk for getting blood clots, so that’s a great thing! Usually if you can attribute the pain to something like exercise, then you don’t need to worry too much about a blood clot. In general, what I tell people, if there’s something than what they usually experience, that’s when they should be concerned. Even though you’re an athlete, it doesn’t mean you’re immune from clots, so it is right to pay attention. I can give you an example: Athletes are more prone to injuries like sprained ankles or need injuries or maybe even broken bones, and those kinds of injuries raise the risk of clots. The worse the injury, the worse the risk. So if you do get an orthopedic injury, you have an increased risk of clots while you’re healing, so you do need to pay attention to the symptoms. I hope this answer makes sense to you.

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because you exercise a lot, you have a lower risk for getting blood clots, so that’s a great thing! Usually if you can attribute the pain to something like exercise, then you don’t need to worry too much about a blood clot. In general, what I tell people, if there’s something than what they usually experience, that’s when they should be concerned. Even though you’re an athlete, it doesn’t mean you’re immune from clots, so it is right to pay attention. I can give you an example: Athletes are more prone to injuries like sprained ankles or need injuries or maybe even broken bones, and those kinds of injuries raise the risk of clots. The worse the injury, the worse the risk. So if you do get an orthopedic injury, you have an increased risk of clots while you’re healing, so you do need to pay attention to the symptoms. I hope this answer makes sense to you.

It’s important to understand that all of these vascular diseases are preventable. It all starts with a healthy lifestyle, healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal weight, and not risk factors. \n\nA recent survey shows that from 2009 to 2019, in the U.S., women’s awareness of heart disease as their number one killer went down from 65% to 44%. You can read it about it here: [https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000907](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000907)\n\nWhen people go to their annual physical, how often do they ask their provider about what their top risk is? People don’t ask and people don’t talk about it. Through this survey, we learned that we’re failing people because people don’t know. I wish people would ask their health status and ask their provider: “What is the most likely thing that could make me sick?” This is so important.",

It all starts with a healthy lifestyle, healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal weight, and not risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A recent survey shows that from 2009 to 2019, in the U.S., women’s awareness of heart disease as their number one killer went down from 65% to 44%. You can read it about it here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000907\"&gt;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000907&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people go to their annual physical, how often do they ask their provider about what their top risk is? People don’t ask and people don’t talk about it. Through this survey, we learned that we’re failing people because people don’t know. I wish people would ask their health status and ask their provider: “What is the most likely thing that could make me sick?” This is so important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The other big one that we test for is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is not an inherited disorder. It is an autoimmune disorder. In my practice, if somebody has a clot on the pill, I don’t usually check them for an underlying sticky blood problem. The pill itself is enough – it does make the blood very sticky.",

I think that what we have to do is imagine a clot has broken off and it’s gone around and come into the pulmonary artery. If it’s one that is a nice, dense, firm blood clots – then it’s less likely to break up into little pieces when it gets into the lungs to block one of the large vessels. But if it’s a blood clot , it can break off and block the peripheral artery… I don’t think it depends on the cause of the clot. It’s more dependent on how firm the clot is. \n\nThe next consideration is HRT. I’m so frustrated by these questions sometimes because we have two types of HRT. Tablet HRT, which has estrogen in it, which makes your blood sticky and is associated with risk. Then we also have patch HRT, which does not increase clot risk. If you are worried about the risk of clots with HRT, we recommend transdermal HRT. Thanks for the great question!",

But I can say, firstly, I  believe you are in North America. As I say to my patients, take the injections at roughly the same time every day because the injection lasts for up to 24 hours. If you left any longer than that, you have a period where you might not be covered by the blood thinner. I have’t seen anyone who has complained of tiredness with that drug, but I think being pregnant makes you feel quite tired. I remember feeling quite tired when I was pregnant. Best of luck with your pregnancy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

They tend to be the ones in the hospital who are very sick, and may also be older and/or overweight, diabetes, and/or other risk factors. Is it that or is it the COVID itself that is making the blood so sticky? That’s the problem, but it’s not clear yet.

That’s because we’re trying to reduce the risk. If we give a blood thinner, we reduce the risk by about 50%. The second problem is in those who have pneumonia/long failure and need ventilation. They have a lot of inflammation int heir lungs and that tends to cause clots. That really needs treatment with anti-inflammatories; anticoagulants will not help.",

So if we think about a heart attack, it’s when you get a clot in an artery in your heart, and the brain, blocks . We’ve got venous clots, which are clots in the veins, and are usually ini the deep veins of the legs, but they don’t cause damage in the same way. As the clot grows, it can break off, travel through the body and block the blood supply to the lungs, which is called a pulmonary embolism. A DVT can be pain and sometimes change of color in the leg. A PE can be pain, shortness of breath, sometimes cough, sometimes people cough of blood. As a doctor, I always teach other doctors- I remind them off, if you have unexplained chest symptoms, it could be a PE, and need to think about that in their diagnosis.",

Me, sitting in this chair, the blood flow through my veins falls off by 50%. I need to move around, you need to move around too! There are things that make blood sticky, such as if you’re ill, if you have a chest infection, if you’re on the pill, if you are on hormone replacement. But the number 1 cause is going into the hospital, especially if you’re having an operation because you’re immobile and on the operating table. After surgery, your blood gets sticky.",
