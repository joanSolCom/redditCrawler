Some also offer in-person (now virtual) support groups. I would urge parents to try these out, even if they have to seek out groups like these from other hospitals, because you never know when you'll need support.\n\nBy and large, though, many preemie families leave the hospital and then struggle to fit right back into the world they knew. That was mostly our experience -- it seemed like it was time to leave the hospital behind and move on. \n\nBut you can't leave those experiences and memories and feelings behind so easily. It's really important for preemie families to have friends and family (and professional support, whenever possible) who understand that this is something that will continue to play a role in our lives for months or even years. \n\nTalking about it can be the first step, but taking action can also help -- writing about it, volunteering or donating with preemie organizations, helping others through it.

If I may put on my health/science journalism hat, here are a few facts and statistics:\n\n1. First, there are racial disparities that are due to decades/centuries of marginalization and discrimination, both in society and in the health system. Black parents give birth prematurely 50 percent more than white parents in the United States. Each year, 14 percent of African American births happen early, compared with 9 percent of white births. Hispanic and Indigenous parents give birth early at higher rates as well—12 and 13 percent of the time, respectively. And once those babies are born, they immediately begin facing racial discrimination in NICUs across the country, research has shown.\n2. Then, there are disparities in economic background and insurance coverage. Lack of access to affordable health care is a huge risk factor for preterm birth—nearly 20 percent of uninsured women deliver preterm. Rep. Pramila Jayapal makes a really compelling case in the book for how improving health coverage can go a long way both in preventing premature birth and in caring for babies who arrive early.\n\nThese are just two examples, but I'm sure there are more!",

Even worse, arguing facts and data can backfire, causing people to dig in even deeper. This [super-short Global Weirding episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkMIjbDtdo0) breaks it down; please give it a watch!\n\nTo your questions, however, there absolutely are answers. First, regarding climate models, evaluating the models, kicking their tires, and finding out where they fail is a big part of [my own research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3534-z). And as I talk about [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGF4-JyHh_8), those of us who work with models on a regular basis are very cognizant of where they fail. However, what people who use the \"all models are wrong\" argument fail to recognize is that they are focusing on the internal noise rather than the external signal. Specifically:\n\n* While the system is full of non-linearities that affect weather and even climate over time scales from seconds to decades, these fluctuations remain within a given bound, constrained by external forcing which determines the net inflow and outflow of heat to the earth's climate system. And it's this external forcing that's changing.\n* The basic thermodynamics that explains how increasing the amount of heat trapped inside the climate system will warm the planet has been well understood since the 1890s. Arrhenius calculated the first climate model by hand: and he was right. We don't need computers; it's just basic physics. More [here](https://history.aip.org/climate/index.htm).\n* There are non-linearities or feedbacks within the system; and it is clear from comparing observations with model simulations that: (a) these are acting to [amplify](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-scientists-estimate-climate-sensitivity) the effect of external forcing, and (b) climate models [under-estimate](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/15/) these feedbacks over the long term. Which is one of the things I personally consider to be most frightening about the [unprecedented experiment](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/12/120202) we're conducting with the planet.\n* Finally, and most tellingly, anyone who argues that a natural fluctuation or variability is causing warming is completely ignoring the basic principle of conservation of energy. Natural cycles don't and can't create heat. They alter temperature simply by moving heat around the earth system: from east to west, north to south, ocean to atmosphere, and back again. A classic example is the so-called [Medieval Warm Period](https://www.skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period-intermediate.htm) which, if you lived in Siberia, would have been called the Medieval Ice Age because while one part of the world was unusually warm, another was unusually cold. Today, however, the [heat content of the entire planet](https://skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=66) (ocean, atmosphere, land surface and cryosphere) is increasing in the amount of approximately 4 Hiroshima bombs' worth of energy per second, and that heat has to be coming from somewhere. It can't just be a natural cycle because that would mean heat was being spontaneously created from nothing. (I suppose you could imagine a scenario where a natural cycle was triggering some type of systematic change in cloud properties which were in turn altering the radiative balance of the climate system .. but such a change would be eminently observable and obvious, and no one has observed it!).\n\nI hope this helps! You may enjoy [Real Climate](http://www.realclimate.org/), a blog written by many climate scientists and physicists that discusses recent research as well as more detailed issues like this. You would probably also enjoy [this study](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/25/heres-what-happens-when-you-try-to-replicate-climate-contrarian-papers) we did, where we re-analyzed 38 publications from scratch and found an error in each that, when corrected, brought their conclusions or findings into line with the consensus in the scientific literature.\n\n\\- Katharine",

The best place to start a conversation is with something that we both agree about, we're interested in, and we care about. Then, connect the dots to why, given what you both agree on, you're concerned about a changing climate. And finally, make sure to have an example (or a few) of a positive, helpful solution that they can get on board with and feel hopeful about.\n\nFor example: I live in West Texas, where people care a LOT about water. We never have enough of it, unless we have too much. So when I talk to farmers, and producers, and water managers, I start with talking about our droughts and floods and how bad they've been, and what their experience has been like. Then, I share my concerns on how our rainfall cycle is becoming even more extreme: stronger, longer droughts interspersed with even heavier rain events. Finally, I talk solutions: planning, conservation, and the fact that wind and solar energy doesn't need any water, whereas fracking and power generation from fossil fuels does. Here's an example of me talking about climate change to people in Texas -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJhczZdnl\\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJhczZdnl_4)\n\nif I'm talking to a church group, or students at a Christian college, I begin with what we believe: that God created this amazing universe we live in, gave us responsibility to care for every living thing on the planet, and called us to care for the less fortunate among us, the very people who are most affected by and vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate. Then I talk about solutions that can help people, alleviating poverty, hunger, disease - and fixing climate change at the same time. Here's an example of that type of talk -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPyXgfuwMUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPyXgfuwMUQ)\n\nIf I'm talking to someone who shares my interests in skiing... well, direct connection there!

The fact that there's more jobs in the solar energy industry than the coal industry, and for five years in a row now the fastest-growing job in the US according to the Bureau of Labor has been either wind energy or solar technician.\n\nI did a TED talk recently on exactly this topic - if you'd like more examples, including what happened when the Rotary Club invited me to speak, please check it out! -&gt; [https://www.ted.com/talks/katharine\\_hayhoe\\_the\\_most\\_important\\_thing\\_you\\_can\\_do\\_to\\_fight\\_climate\\_change\\_talk\\_about\\_it?language=en](https://www.ted.com/talks/katharine_hayhoe_the_most_important_thing_you_can_do_to_fight_climate_change_talk_about_it?language=en)\n\n\\- Katharine",

Last night I was at our regional science fair, and some of the kids' projects -- water filtration powered by solar energy, algae biofuels, drought-resistant plants and more -- were just amazing. Then there's the kids like Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Villasenor and thousands more around the world, from Belgium to India to the US, who are striking for climate.\n\nWhen I'm asked to speak to a class, I ALWAYS say yes because it is so important that they understand not only what is going on, but what they can do to help.\n\nI can't make any more specific recommendations without knowing more about your interests and abilities, but I do know that there are dozens of ways to plug in and help, through volunteer programs and more, that invest in kids' lives AND encourage and support them to make a difference in the world.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about how amazing and inspirational kids can be, check out my personal favourite of all our Global Weirding episodes, \"I'm only a kid so I can't do anything about climate change .. right?\" -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PslL9WC-2cQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PslL9WC-2cQ)\n\n\\- Katharine",

Then there&amp;#39;s the kids like Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Villasenor and thousands more around the world, from Belgium to India to the US, who are striking for climate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m asked to speak to a class, I ALWAYS say yes because it is so important that they understand not only what is going on, but what they can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t make any more specific recommendations without knowing more about your interests and abilities, but I do know that there are dozens of ways to plug in and help, through volunteer programs and more, that invest in kids&amp;#39; lives AND encourage and support them to make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to learn more about how amazing and inspirational kids can be, check out my personal favourite of all our Global Weirding episodes, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m only a kid so I can&amp;#39;t do anything about climate change .. right?&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PslL9WC-2cQ\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PslL9WC-2cQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Katharine&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But the idea that it’s all over, so we may as well just give up, is not just a myth: it’s a dangerous one.\n\nThat’s  because there is a huge difference – what may possibly be the  difference between civilization as we know it versus a world we wouldn’t  recognize – between a future where we continue to depend on fossil  fuels as our primary energy source versus a world  where we rapidly reduce and eventually eliminate our emissions of carbon  dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.\n\nAnd what’s the main factor responsible for this difference? Our choices.\n\nIt’s  true that since the beginning of the industrial revolution the average temperature of the earth has already warmed by a degree Celsius or 1.8  degrees Fahrenheit. And even if there were a magic switch we could flip  today that would turn off all our coal, oil and gas immediately, we’d  still see some warming from what we’ve put up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut  just like when a doctor tells us our arteries aren’t looking great and  we need to make some lifestyle changes right away, it’s not too late to  change. In the same way, human activities have already altered the  climate, and some – like [Louisiana’s tribes](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/5/isle-de-jean-charles-louisiana-residents-climate-r/) who are becoming climate refugees after persistent flooding is forcing them to relocate, and the people of [Kivalina](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-life-is-like-in-kivalina-alaska-2017-9),  Alaska, who are seeing the permafrost their homes are built on thaw and  crumble into the ocean – are already experiencing dangerous impacts.\n\nBut  the quicker we replace our old, dirty ways of getting energy with new,  clean sources, the less temperature change we’ll see, and the lower the  risk of serious and even very dangerous consequences for all of us: [dangerously hot summers](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180801093636.htm), [reduced crop yields](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/35/9326), [stronger droughts](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/us-southwest-already-mega-drought/578248/), [more intense hurricanes](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/9/), greater [areas burned by wildfire](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/25#fig-25-4), and all the ways these impact our [lives](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/), our [health](https://health2016.globalchange.gov/), and the [economy](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1362) right here in the places where we live, and around the world.\n\nThat’s why, when it comes to climate change, it’s not too late to act.\n\nBut the window of opportunity *is*  closing fast. And that’s why it’s so important to tell our leaders - at  our organization, school, business, university, church; our city,  state, province, or region; and of course our national leaders too -  that we couldn’t care less whether they “believe” in climate change or  not. What we need to know how they plan to fix it, now, before it really  is too late.\n\nFor more, see our short Global Weirding episode that asks, “it’s too late to do anything about climate change, right?” -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv7zFAdZ6LI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv7zFAdZ6LI)\n\n\\- Katharine",
