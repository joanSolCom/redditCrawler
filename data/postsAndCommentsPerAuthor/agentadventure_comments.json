Any person who hops online to be shitty to vulnerable women has a terrible life themselves.

That being said, we DID amicably separate earlier this summer after 4 years together. There was no hard feelings or interpersonal conflicts, but his career is on the east coast and mine is on the west and the distance wasn’t tenable to maintain a real marriage. He has a new girlfriend who I adore and we still talk at least once a week. We had a very successful relationship for the time in our lives that each of us needed the other and neither of us have ruled out re-committing down the road but for now our respective career trajectories (my directing/producing, his small business) are what need to come first while in our 20s. I love and miss him but wish him the very best in his endeavors.\n\nIn the future, I’ll likely avoid having a public relationship again so I doubt I’ll be talking about anything else in this vein. Not that I’m FAMOUS famous, but neither Nathan nor I were crazy about our love life being in the public eye and how that felt; hindsight being 20/20 I wouldn’t do that so early on in our relationship + my career path.\n\nHave a lovely evening and I hope this clears up any questions.",

I’d rather you just take a minute to critically examine why that joke would even be funny to you rather than delete it.\n\nI come from a part of the US where couples with different skin tones were getting lynched within my parents’ lifetimes. I also belong to a group of workers who get threatened and killed for making choices about their sexuality that others’ find distasteful. My little sister, a completely uninvolved party, gets my IR videos spammed to her and receives harassment just because we came from the same house. Never anything but IR videos and she feels unsafe. I keep a gun on me at all times because I was specifically doxxed not for being a whore but specifically because I wasn’t exclusively a whore for white men and routinely get threatened over that specifically. People try to find my house and threaten to show up and kill my family for my being a “coalburner.” I will never have children because I’m scared someone will try to hurt them. Like I completely understand I’m just a disembodied figure on a screen to you with no internal motivations, but sex workers actually monitor their media and read it extensively. When you make shitty little jokes about us being unlovable, you contribute to the same culture that kept my friend August Ames isolated and contributed to her suicidal motivations year before last. Words have power.\n\nOk, now that that’s said, chastisement over, everybody back to fapping. 🤗 Again, please keep your comment up, I want you to think about this conversation when you see it in your history. Have a nice weekend and thanks for the apology!",

People try to find my house and threaten to show up and kill my family for my being a “coalburner.” I will never have children because I’m scared someone will try to hurt them. Like I completely understand I’m just a disembodied figure on a screen to you with no internal motivations, but sex workers actually monitor their media and read it extensively. When you make shitty little jokes about us being unlovable, you contribute to the same culture that kept my friend August Ames isolated and contributed to her suicidal motivations year before last. Words have power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that that’s said, chastisement over, everybody back to fapping. 🤗 Again, please keep your comment up, I want you to think about this conversation when you see it in your history. Have a nice weekend and thanks for the apology!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is important to note because I had to wear skimpy booth babe uniforms to work each day.\n\nThe maids came in one morning as I was finishing up getting ready and I told them to come in and do their thing, I was just about to leave. Two women came in and started wiping down surfaces as I was lacing up my heels to go out the door. I guess one woman noticed my ring tattoo and said in Spanish that she couldn’t believe my husband let me go out looking like this. She had no clue how any self respecting wife would be in a place like this and how my husband must be so ashamed of me, that she’d kill her husband if she found videos of someone like me on his computer. Now this line of logic isn’t new to me so I wasn’t even particularly mad, but I waited to hear if she had more to say. They more or less switched topics and I continued to stay mute until I grabbed my purse and turned around as I was leaving to say, “oh hey could you leave me some extra towels?” in Spanish.\n\nThey both whipped their heads around from making up the bed and the woman doing the majority of the shit talking turned white as a sheet. She asked me if I spoke Spanish and I responded with “yo viví en Mexico por dos años, mamita.” She immediately launches into a backpedaling stream of apologies and excuses saying how I was “just so beautiful, it’s amazing your man is so secure” and begging me not to report her. I just laughed and said it was fine, my husband is in the business too and we’re both hot and slutty together, I told her I used to be a maid and got tired of blowing my nose and smelling Clorox (true). She laughed and I think maybe realized that not all people who do sexy stuff for a living are succubi that want to steal your man, we’re just trying to make it by too. Hopefully it was a learning experience. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nBut for real though, who shit talks in Spanish anymore? It’s so common now!",

Like there’s never a day that I can’t go do SOMETHING and reasonably make $500-1000 but I have to spend money to make money so that sometimes means I can barely make even after flights, hotels, wardrobe, agency fees and taxes. You can play the game carefully and walk out of this having secured a modestly good bag (think low seven figures) or you can walk out if it poorer than you started.\n\nI can tell you the names of top 10 on Pornhub starlets who are in six figures worth of debt to the IRS and I can tell you girls you’ve never heard of who own houses all over the world. If you’re sexy (note I didn’t say pretty), savvy and lucky with very specific needs it’s a great path but I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody who didn’t genuinely love sex. Basically the money is GOOD but not so good that an intelligent person would choose it just to get rich quick. I have always felt like I had too much sexual energy for any mortal man to withstand reasonably so it serves as a double utility for me.\n\nEdit: I misunderstood the question completely. It’s mostly anyone moving around large amounts of money and platforms like PayPal have risk management departments that actively scour the internet looking for relationships in their customer database to porn. Seriously. It’s a whole thing. We’ve even had our personal non-business accounts shut down because our real names are often public knowledge.",

You can play the game carefully and walk out of this having secured a modestly good bag (think low seven figures) or you can walk out if it poorer than you started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can tell you the names of top 10 on Pornhub starlets who are in six figures worth of debt to the IRS and I can tell you girls you’ve never heard of who own houses all over the world. If you’re sexy (note I didn’t say pretty), savvy and lucky with very specific needs it’s a great path but I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody who didn’t genuinely love sex. Basically the money is GOOD but not so good that an intelligent person would choose it just to get rich quick. I have always felt like I had too much sexual energy for any mortal man to withstand reasonably so it serves as a double utility for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I misunderstood the question completely. It’s mostly anyone moving around large amounts of money and platforms like PayPal have risk management departments that actively scour the internet looking for relationships in their customer database to porn. Seriously. It’s a whole thing. We’ve even had our personal non-business accounts shut down because our real names are often public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Companies like Brazzers aren’t going anywhere, they’re modifying and expanding to include us as well in other sectors of their business model (I sell scenes to them directly now.)

I’m gonna go back to filing my taxes, you have a great night!\n\nEdit: also on a common sense level, the introduction of convenient subscription services totally redefined consumer habits in the mainstream, there’s been countless studies on this.

Just because content is made by a performer does not exclusively limit it to being shitty phone camera footage, and the amount of money moving through mediums that do traffic that type of “low effort” content suggests there is consumer demand there as well. I was a camgirl with a following before porn but undoubtedly they grew me so I concede your point there. Companies like Brazzers aren’t going anywhere, they’re modifying and expanding to include us as well in other sectors of their business model (I sell scenes to them directly now.) Also performer driven ventures swept the AVN awards this year with Kayden Kross, Angela White And Riley Reid all winning big, and fans are voters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’re popping off and telling an expert in their field that they’re wrong without any receipts, and on a more human level, you’re coming at it rudely. I’m gonna go back to filing my taxes, you have a great night!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: also on a common sense level, the introduction of convenient subscription services totally redefined consumer habits in the mainstream, there’s been countless studies on this. It’s called being a disruptor. Your obtuseness is making my brain short circuit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I’m more anxious on a set as a director than I am a performer because my ass is theoretically grass if anyone called the cops on my location or slipped and fell on my set and got hurt.

Speaking from my own life, it was amazing and exhilarating but also kind of terrifying when I suddenly had all this money coming in and no clue what to do with it or how not to lose it. It feels crazy impossible now but trust me, you will get used to this money and it will become easier to spend. Have fun and breathe easy knowing you could potentially be set for the rest of your life if you manage this money well and save, save, save.\n\nAgain, so happy to hear sex work has positively improved your life!",

Speaking from my own life, it was amazing and exhilarating but also kind of terrifying when I suddenly had all this money coming in and no clue what to do with it or how not to lose it. It feels crazy impossible now but trust me, you will get used to this money and it will become easier to spend. Have fun and breathe easy knowing you could potentially be set for the rest of your life if you manage this money well and save, save, save.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, so happy to hear sex work has positively improved your life!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is important to note because I had to wear skimpy booth babe uniforms to work each day.\n\nThe maids came in one morning as I was finishing up getting ready and I told them to come in and do their thing, I was just about to leave. Two women came in and started wiping down surfaces as I was lacing up my heels to go out the door. I guess one woman noticed my ring tattoo and said in Spanish that she couldn’t believe my husband let me go out looking like this. She had no clue how any self respecting wife would be in a place like this and how my husband must be so ashamed of me, that she’d kill her husband if she found videos of someone like me on his computer. Now this line of logic isn’t new to me so I wasn’t even particularly mad, but I waited to hear if she had more to say. They more or less switched topics and I continued to stay mute until I grabbed my purse and turned around as I was leaving to say, “oh hey could you leave me some extra towels?” in Spanish.\n\nThey both whipped their heads around from making up the bed and the woman doing the majority of the shit talking turned white as a sheet. She asked me if I spoke Spanish and I responded with “yo viví en Mexico por dos años, mamita.” She immediately launches into a backpedaling stream of apologies and excuses saying how I was “just so beautiful, it’s amazing your man is so secure” and begging me not to report her. I just laughed and said it was fine, my husband is in the business too and we’re both hot and slutty together, I told her I used to be a maid and got tired of blowing my nose and smelling Clorox (true). She laughed and I think maybe realized that not all people who do sexy stuff for a living are succubi that want to steal your man, we’re just trying to make it by too. Hopefully it was a learning experience. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nBut for real though, who shit talks in Spanish anymore? It’s so common now!",

Guy comes in, had a bad night, he’s in a bad mood, he brings those vibes into work and he’s manhandling you and not doing proper check in with you. Like, if you need to smack my ass, get a little rough and say something lightly degrading that’s cool with me, but I expect you to check in and make sure what you’re doing isn’t causing me physical discomfort. I also expect you to cease that role play when we’re not wrapped and clearly out of character. Yes I can correct you verbally but it kills the vibe if I have to stop the scene and explain it to you, it saves everyone time if you give me a little “you good?” Nod and I can let you know “yes” or “no.” Watch female performers’ hands in a scene, you’ll see us tapping and squeezing a lot to indicate slower/shallower, etc.\n\nPeople who think you’re there to fuck them personally and it’s not a job and who spend the whole day monopolizing your attention. Yes I’m happy to fluff you and create chemistry.

Like, if you need to smack my ass, get a little rough and say something lightly degrading that’s cool with me, but I expect you to check in and make sure what you’re doing isn’t causing me physical discomfort. I also expect you to cease that role play when we’re not wrapped and clearly out of character. Yes I can correct you verbally but it kills the vibe if I have to stop the scene and explain it to you, it saves everyone time if you give me a little “you good?” Nod and I can let you know “yes” or “no.” Watch female performers’ hands in a scene, you’ll see us tapping and squeezing a lot to indicate slower/shallower, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who think you’re there to fuck them personally and it’s not a job and who spend the whole day monopolizing your attention.

Nobody wants to take porn money which is very frustrating especially if you’re on the production side of it as well (like I am) and are constantly moving large sums of money around to various places. There’s so many tools that could help our independent businesses (like patreon, Kickstarter, PayPal, etc.) to grow and compete with the old guard in porn but it’s hard to get ahead when even your website host doesn’t want\n\n\nNo oversight body that can make rulings. We’ve had a lot of public press lately about some creeps in our business and it’s really highlighted how we really have no referees when it’s brought to light that someone isn’t being a team player on set (there’s a variety of setiquette sins that aren’t rape, but still make you a shitty/problematic colleague) up to and including assault.

Every year it feels like AHF tries to come up with a new way to shut us down. Most sets by virtue of their overly stringent laws are out of local compliance legally speaking. So what that means for us practically speaking is that it’s virtually impossible to have valid production insurance or worker’s comp claims BC even if we wanted to comply with the laws at hand, it would drive us out of business (proctors, expensive licenses each scene, condom enforcement which is a whole thing, etc). I’m more anxious on a set as a director than I am a performer because my ass is theoretically grass if anyone called the cops on my location or slipped and fell on my set and got hurt.

It’s a good move to do porn in Miami, Los Angeles or Vegas if you’re a provider because it can raise your escorting rates and basically eliminates the need to advertise as clients will DM you. The odds are stacked against you actually making good money at it though. In San Fernando valley, the capitol of porn, there’s 3500 models looking for work at any given time and only about 900 actual jobs per month. I’m the exception the proves the rule but even me I make most of my wealth off clips and camming.\n\nThe wages are high per scene compared to an appointment for most locales ($900-1200 per diem) but you may only get two or three bookings per month and some months you might get none, which in an expensive city like LA doesn’t get you far.\n\nIf a “studio” or an agency is anywhere else besides California or Florida, they’re pimps or scammers. There’s 4-7 agencies arguably worth a damn in the whole business, they’ll show you the ropes if you want to do it but I urge caution in the exposure it brings. There’s no more anonymity for you after that. My mother and father get crank calls, someone doxxed me for doing scenes with black men this month and I’m actually having to move because my home address and pictures of my house are all over the internet now. (My porn name is Lena Paul in case you’re skeptical and my post history has proof)\n\nAlso GET THE GARDASIL SHOTS BEFORE YOU DO PORN — I’ve known girls who’ve gotten cancer from HPV they contracted here because we almost never use barriers. We STD test every two weeks and that’s it. We also don’t test for herpes because it’s almost impossibly to accurately test for, so you can infer how prevalent that is within the talent pool.",

I’m the exception the proves the rule but even me I make most of my wealth off clips and camming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wages are high per scene compared to an appointment for most locales ($900-1200 per diem) but you may only get two or three bookings per month and some months you might get none, which in an expensive city like LA doesn’t get you far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a “studio” or an agency is anywhere else besides California or Florida, they’re pimps or scammers. There’s 4-7 agencies arguably worth a damn in the whole business, they’ll show you the ropes if you want to do it but I urge caution in the exposure it brings. There’s no more anonymity for you after that. My mother and father get crank calls, someone doxxed me for doing scenes with black men this month and I’m actually having to move because my home address and pictures of my house are all over the internet now. (My porn name is Lena Paul in case you’re skeptical and my post history has proof)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also GET THE GARDASIL SHOTS BEFORE YOU DO PORN — I’ve known girls who’ve gotten cancer from HPV they contracted here because we almost never use barriers. We STD test every two weeks and that’s it. We also don’t test for herpes because it’s almost impossibly to accurately test for, so you can infer how prevalent that is within the talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Always being scheduled for exactly 38 hours of work so my boss didn’t have to give me full time benefits, while expecting me to perform all the labor that a full time employee does.

I can’t tell you based on this limited snapshot of your life if your fella is your forever husband but that’s not necessarily what’s important: you’re hurting and you’re undergoing a lot of emotional strain.\n\nMaking yourself available to your children all the time, being housewife and mom, I’m sure some days all you want is just an hour of peace and quiet but everyone *needs* something from you. It’s exhausting and there are no breaks.\n\nWhat I’ve discovered is most important in navigating my own marriage is that I have to be my own advocate. My husband does his best to look after me and make sure that I’m not overwhelmed by the endless deluge of personal and professional shit that we deal with as a couple, but he’s not the same person and he misses stuff. When I feel a need going unmet in my marriage, I’ve learned to just be blunt about it but to wait for the right time to talk about it. Sometimes text messages are ok, if you’re super busy but it’s best in person. I’ll lay out my problems, and very concisely explain to him how he can help me with them and then remind him later. Oftentimes just talking about it and feeling heard helps and I get the vibe that that’s what’s happening here. You don’t feel heard and you need to tell him that.\n\nTell him, do not ask him, that you will be taking a night off and going to do something you enjoy (get a massage, go window-shopping, eat at your fav restaurant) and he can either come with you if you have a sitter that’s reliable, or just go on your own. I don’t lean on my husband to satisfy my every need anymore, sometimes I just go do stuff on my own. It used to feel unnatural, but once you have family commitments you’re just so happy to be out of the house it doesn’t matter LOL.\n\nAll that aside, you’re doing a very tough thing. Idk about you but sometimes I still feel like a kid who’s just posing as an adult and fooling everyone, but who secretly has no clue what they’re doing. You’re doing it, mama, and you’re doing a good job at it! But you owe it to yourself and to your babies to keep your Love tank full, and you need to tell your husband how shit is going to happen when it comes to your basic needs as a human. You are partners, with the age difference there may FEEL like there’s a power imbalance, but remember that you run his fucking house and he had better take good care of you because he literally can’t afford to lose you. Operate from that knowledge, mama, you’re not a kid anymore.\n\nMuch love to you and your little one on the way!",

I moved out with a s/o at your age in a different state so here’s how *I* did it a few years ago and what I should have done.\n\n1. I couch surfed for a few weeks and walked into restaurants and applied for a server job. The benefit of California is that there’s a lot of people and a lot of food. Being able to make tips meant I could make $2K-$2.5K per month instead of barely over 1K at a regular minimum wage. I went for an informal bar/grill with a high volume and a large staff to give myself maximum schedule flexibility.\n\n2. While going to work, i went to school and took out loans in order to do so. I struck up a deal with my parents where they could still claim me as a dependent on their taxes in exchange for their signing off on my FAFSA loan paperwork.\n\n3. I developed websites and managed them for local businesses (particularly small businesses that speak my 2nd language but no English) and helped local event venues manage their calendars better with simple resources. I cleaned houses. I walked dogs. I advertised about helping elderly and disabled folks with certain basic life stuff that didn’t require certification.\n\n4. I rented from an elderly man who needed the extra income and I found him through my network of distant church connections from in the past. You could find a similar room for rent situation on Craigslist. This type of informal situation helps you to get your foot in the door on a rental without having a credit history. I performed small jobs for him in exchange for rent.\n\nI had to do a lot of hard things to maintain my hard won independence and sometimes they were incredibly stupid looking back. By far the dumbest things I did were:\n\n1. Waste my time on the opposite sex and letting petty relationship drama emotionally derail me when I needed to be focusing on my work. I know this seems like kind of a silly thing but I am so serious when I tell you to put your career and advancement first, especially if you want a family later on.\n\n2. Spend impulsively, particularly cigarettes and fast food. Strike up a meal prep deal with roommates and stick to it. I would probably cry if I knew how much I spent on premade food over my lifetime.\n\n3. Work too much and not balance my school responsibilities correctly because I was exhausting myself. This is not a sprint, this is a marathon. If you have to choose between cup noodles and an extra four hours of studying or sushi and a work shift, just tighten your belt and study. Your mind is your biggest investment right now and these next five years are integral to your personal development.\n\n4. Picked an impractical major, I’m going back now and getting my credentials in computer science like i should have when I started working in the field. Liberal arts get a bad rap but for your situation I recommend either a trade school (lineman is an EXCELLENT choice), or an apprenticeship in something related to solar tech as that’s one of the fastest growing fields in energy and infrastructure.\n\nGet a job first, then save up at least 1-2 months salary depending on how volatile your home life is, while you’re doing that look for roommate advertisements and answer odd job classifieds in the local papers/bulletin boards/Craigslist.\n\nI’m sorry you didn’t get all the resources in life you need to succeed like some folks do. But let me tell you, it feels 100X more satisfying when you come out on the other side successful. You’re going to OWN at adulting my dude, I have faith in you.\n\nEdit: I have no clue why my list got formatted like that, I’m on mobile but also am an idiot.",

        "body": "Hi, content creating degenerate here (a fairly prolific one at that) — I’ve made a bit of violent porn in my day but more importantly I’ve spent time with a lot of the minds behind sites like legalporno and kink.com. I get where you’re coming from, I probably had the same attitude when I came into the porn industry — while there are predatory people within the business (just like all entertainment businesses as we’re seeing in the news these days) I want to dispel the myth that that’s happening routinely. European porn can get a little weird sometimes, in my opinion because of the amount of women from Baltic states who are doing survival sex work but in the US, the majority of the minds behind your filthiest porn are middle to upper class background women and forced sex is a routine fetish for my peers.\n\nFor me? It’s a paycheck, I don’t do it often cuz it’s not my cup of tea but I always have a blast when I do. I liken it to wrestling or MMA. Should we go around beating people up on the streets for fun? Of course not! But under the right setting, with appropriate mutually agreed upon guidelines it is REALLY fun to get the shit kicked out of/kick the shit out of someone. Saying we shouldn’t have forced sex fantasy porn or sadist porn is like saying we shouldn’t make war movies or revenge movies because they glorify violence. We make entertainment.

I get where you’re coming from, I probably had the same attitude when I came into the porn industry — while there are predatory people within the business (just like all entertainment businesses as we’re seeing in the news these days) I want to dispel the myth that that’s happening routinely. European porn can get a little weird sometimes, in my opinion because of the amount of women from Baltic states who are doing survival sex work but in the US, the majority of the minds behind your filthiest porn are middle to upper class background women and forced sex is a routine fetish for my peers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me? It’s a paycheck, I don’t do it often cuz it’s not my cup of tea but I always have a blast when I do. I liken it to wrestling or MMA. Should we go around beating people up on the streets for fun? Of course not! But under the right setting, with appropriate mutually agreed upon guidelines it is REALLY fun to get the shit kicked out of/kick the shit out of someone. Saying we shouldn’t have forced sex fantasy porn or sadist porn is like saying we shouldn’t make war movies or revenge movies because they glorify violence. We make entertainment. Sick people will not understand the nuances of our brand of entertainment, but we do not babyproof the world for those people at the sacrifice of the enjoyment of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Not to sound like a dick, but when you're shooting for the top companies, there's like 10 male talent that I work with on a regular basis and frequently we get booked multiple days within the same work period together. Last month I showed up to work every day for a week and it was the same guy. My sexual \"number\" is less than some civilians I know, although definitely high.\n\nThe gallons of cum thing is just fucking nonsense. There's no way to quantify that realistically, every guy's load is different. It's just silly sensationalism.\n\n\"Dr\" Mitchell's name is fairly worthless in our industry due to the fact that the AIM foundation was responsible for the largest information leak ever, with hundreds of performers legal names and addresses being leaked from the AIM database due to shoddy security measures a few years ago. This led to many performers' lives being threatened by deranged stalkers who could simply Ctrl+F through the leaked data and find the current addresses, legal names and phone numbers of their victims. It was a huge crisis that put AIM out of business and we had to implement a lot of new legal measures in order to protect performers after the fact.\n\nI only watched a few minutes of the documentary because I can't stand looking at this woman's face.\n\nEDIT: oh and I've literally never popped a bad STD test in my career, I've had scares but never anything definitive. We test every two weeks religiously and practice much better sexual healthcare practices than the population at large. Promiscuity ≠ poor sexual hygiene practices.\n\nAlso I've never felt raped on set. It's always a bit strange to me when civilians think we're getting sexually assaulted on the reg but still sample our products in which we're supposedly abused (not saying that's you, I just know people who think like that cuz I was one of them in HS and felt guilty looking at porn). I'm very happy in my career and a glance through my post history will reflect that.",

It&amp;#39;s just silly sensationalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dr&amp;quot; Mitchell&amp;#39;s name is fairly worthless in our industry due to the fact that the AIM foundation was responsible for the largest information leak ever, with hundreds of performers legal names and addresses being leaked from the AIM database due to shoddy security measures a few years ago. This led to many performers&amp;#39; lives being threatened by deranged stalkers who could simply Ctrl+F through the leaked data and find the current addresses, legal names and phone numbers of their victims. It was a huge crisis that put AIM out of business and we had to implement a lot of new legal measures in order to protect performers after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only watched a few minutes of the documentary because I can&amp;#39;t stand looking at this woman&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: oh and I&amp;#39;ve literally never popped a bad STD test in my career, I&amp;#39;ve had scares but never anything definitive. We test every two weeks religiously and practice much better sexual healthcare practices than the population at large. Promiscuity ≠ poor sexual hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;ve never felt raped on set. It&amp;#39;s always a bit strange to me when civilians think we&amp;#39;re getting sexually assaulted on the reg but still sample our products in which we&amp;#39;re supposedly abused (not saying that&amp;#39;s you, I just know people who think like that cuz I was one of them in HS and felt guilty looking at porn). I&amp;#39;m very happy in my career and a glance through my post history will reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Chlamydia scare? Whatever, easy. Chronic BV? Oh Christ almighty, there's like no resources out there. I now have the nicest smelling vag ever though so that's cool.\n\n\nThat porn, unless you're doing a high volume of scenes or leveraging your exposure into other avenues of work, isn't all THAT profitable. It's alright don't get me wrong, but not worth the narrowing of your future job prospects. Unless you just really love sex work and plan to do it your whole life like Nina Hartley, just go into STEM lol\n\n\nThat something like 2 out of 3 working performers has herpes of some form. We're super fastidious about every STI but it's very difficult to accurately test for HSV unless there's an active outbreak from what we're told by regulators.\n\n\nThat I was going to need to have so much sex off screen to feel capable of performing this job. This job is very uniquely draining, I go home and need a lot of love and affection or I start to feel crabby having to project such a huge amount of passion daily. Most jobs' emotional labor is limited to modulating your own emotional responses -- behave professionally, be patient, control your words, etc. while this job's emotional labor involves taking responsibility for the emotional state of your partner. Making sure that they're hot, bothered and turned on is about analyzing what they need and desire and bringing that to the table. It's incredibly rewarding in a way, but very very very draining. It's why I'm not usually the biggest fan of orgies and group sex, it's just bodies smashing together for me, no ability to really get that connection.\n\nBut in case you can't tell by my obsessive over analysis of this job, I really care about it and will be genuinely devastated when I'm no longer able to keep doing it (I've seen my mom's boobs, I know my years are limited 😂).",

Failure to do so would be equivalent to a carpenter showing up to a work site without nails. It's just poor planning.\n\nWhat he's asking and she's admitting to is that her rectum is \"cold\" -- meaning she failed to come to work prepared. This is a faux pas because it can take upwards of an hour to completely warm yourself up (sometimes more or less depending on the body, me is like 20-30min) which greatly slows down and can even ruin set days. We book very expensive shoot houses for limited hours and men have a peak performance window when taking erectile medication, so delaying shoot times is also hard on them. Plus working the dick into a tight ass can also be painful for them as well.\n\n\nThis conversation sounds creepy because in seems like he's \"just the tipping\" her \"why don't you get it in and let yourself warm up\" is him saying \"let's see if we can slow down, give you some time to prepare and determine if you can continue the work day or if we need to kill 2-3K worth of work and everyone go home unpaid.\" As directors and performers, killing a shoot is hell. We hate doing it. Also the directors are out that cash and not entitled to compensation by the company.

(From a hygiene perspective I will note that not all of those performances were with other people while I was ill and anytime we have/are getting over anything that might be contagious we alert our directors and co talents).\n\nThat being said, I've known plenty of girls who have had to kill anal days for various reasons and it doesn't really hurt them professionally in one off circumstances. Don't make a habit of booking things your body can't take but we understand that we work in a delicate field wholly dependent on our bodies being cooperative and shit happens ya know?

The director is helping her out of this tough scenario by suggesting she try to warm up with the male talent bc she will be required to pay a scene kill fee if not.
