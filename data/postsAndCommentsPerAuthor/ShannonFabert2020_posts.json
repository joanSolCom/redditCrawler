I have been endorsed by Labor with another big announcement coming soon. We have a strong grassroots movement. We are committed to working together to flip the 4th and to ditch Mitch. These efforts are going to take all of us working as a unified front to stand up for our shared values. I look forward to your questions about my policies on healthcare, education, infrastructure, and climate change. Please ask me anything about my platform, my campaign, my background, or anything else you would like to know. \n\nI am asking all of you to join Shannon’s Squad by following me on social media. If you are able please pitch in $5 to my campaign, and above all else make your voices are heard at the ballot box. Democrats can win in Kentucky, we just have to fight together to get there. \n\n[Fabert 2020 Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fabert2020/)\n\n[Fabert 2020 Twitter](https://twitter.com/Fabert2020)\n\n[Fabert 2020 Website](https://fabert2020.org/)\n\n[Contribution Form](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/fabertforcongress)\n\nBorn in San Francisco, California, I moved around with my parents to various states in the South until they settled in Memphis when I was nine. As the oldest child, I watched my parents struggle together to provide the best of what they could give us especially concerning education.  I graduated from Bartlett High School in 1996 and received a full scholarship to the University of Tennessee where I received a Bachelor of Science in Communication in 2001.After college, I started my career at FedEx Ground in operations management where I learned the value of process improvement and servant leadership. It was also here that I met my husband, Greg. I was able to leverage my solid foundation of operations and creative problem solving into a career in business consulting and continuous improvement. We moved to Kentucky 10 years ago during the recession, and I fell in love with the state and its people. \n\nGrowing up, I was always politically aware with a uniquely inclusive perspective.  I am the child of an immigrant and veteran who as a child was thrust into the Civil Rights Movement.  I grew up with stories of activism as a family history. I grew up believing that our best leaders worked hard and respectfully to represent all of their constituents, not just the ones that voted for them nor for special interests.  I want to carry on this legacy in Congress fighting for everyday working Americans. \n\nI’ve followed the actions and words of the current Representative of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. The words and actions of Thomas Massie are why I decided to run.  I’ve staked my professional career on building consensus in hard business environments. I’ve fought hard to earn a seat at many leadership tables by not going with the status quo.  I did this through the kind of relationship building and servant leadership that we deserve to have in the House of Representatives.  I could continue to be voter with a limited voice but you should know I’m not that kind of person,  I am the kind of fighter that has to stand up when I see something wrong. And right now, we need a fighter for all Kentuckians, not just the 1%. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us in ways we never thought possible. I have been a vocal advocate for the stimulus packages to give more direct payments to Americans, provide rent subsidies, and to stop funneling cash to wall street. This crisis has shown us we need elected officials who will stand up for everyday Americans. Stimulus packages should be bailing out the kitchen table, not the boardrooms. \n\nOne of the most important things we must change is making sure healthcare coverage is NOT tied to employment. I believe in the creation of a public option to help make healthcare affordable.  The existence of healthcare advocates and rising prescription drug costs within our system demonstrates how much our sick loved ones are exploited by the current system. Kentuckians deserve more from their government. It’s time for our representation to work to meet our needs and protect us from the burgeoning threat of medical bankruptcy.\n\nThis Pandemic has created unprecedented levels of unemployment. I believe we should take a lesson from FDR’s public works projects. We can empower Americans with good jobs at a wage that can support families. We can invest in our infrastructure and allow America to be the world leader in climate-friendly 21st century infrastructure. We can no longer ignore the economic, and tragic human toll that climate change is taking on our communities and our world. The United States has always led the world through innovation, it is time for us to do so again. Along with renewable energy projects, we have to update our infrastructure to give broadband access to under served communities. We must also ensure that clean water access is available to every household. \n\nEducation is the foundation and lifeblood of our democracy and is required to sustain our republic. I believe in a fully funded public education system where our educators are treated and respected like the highly skilled professionals that they are. I believe in an education system that works to create equity in our society to combat the stereotypes and discrimination of the past. A public education system should provide the same quality education to all students, and not just those in affluent areas. Our children are our future, and our representation in Congress should work to always give them the best opportunities possible. With the Pandemic, I must ask, whose children did we leave behind? With at home learning suddenly being required, how do children without broadband access learn? Kentucky’s average connection speed is lower than what is required to sustain video conferencing. This is why I am focused on broadband being included in any infrastructure bills. \n\nThank you to r/Kentuckypolitics, r/VoteDEM, and r/Kentucky being such gracious hosts. As well as all of you for your questions and feedback. We can do this together.",

We have already contacted over 64,000 voters. I have been endorsed by Labor with another big announcement coming soon. We have a strong grassroots movement. We are committed to working together to flip the 4th and to ditch Mitch. These efforts are going to take all of us working as a unified front to stand up for our shared values. I look forward to your questions about my policies on healthcare, education, infrastructure, and climate change. Please ask me anything about my platform, my campaign, my background, or anything else you would like to know.\n\nI am asking all of you to join Shannon’s Squad by following me on social media. If you are able please pitch in $5 to my campaign, and above all else make your voices are heard at the ballot box. Democrats can win in Kentucky, we just have to fight together to get there.\n\n[Fabert 2020 Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fabert2020/)\n\n[Fabert 2020 Twitter](https://twitter.com/Fabert2020)\n\n[Fabert 2020 Website](https://fabert2020.org/)\n\n[Contribution Form](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/fabertforcongress)\n\nBorn in San Francisco, California, I moved around with my parents to various states in the South until they settled in Memphis when I was nine. As the oldest child, I watched my parents struggle together to provide the best of what they could give us especially concerning education. I graduated from Bartlett High School in 1996 and received a full scholarship to the University of Tennessee where I received a Bachelor of Science in Communication in 2001.After college, I started my career at FedEx Ground in operations management where I learned the value of process improvement and servant leadership. It was also here that I met my husband, Greg. I was able to leverage my solid foundation of operations and creative problem solving into a career in business consulting and continuous improvement. We moved to Kentucky 10 years ago during the recession, and I fell in love with the state and its people.\n\nGrowing up, I was always politically aware with a uniquely inclusive perspective.  I am the child of an immigrant and veteran who as a child was thrust into the Civil Rights Movement.  I grew up with stories of activism as a family history. I grew up believing that our best leaders worked hard and respectfully to represent all of their constituents, not just the ones that voted for them nor for special interests.  I want to carry on this legacy in Congress fighting for everyday working Americans.\n\nI’ve followed the actions and words of the current Representative of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. The words and actions of Thomas Massie are why I decided to run.  I’ve staked my professional career on building consensus in hard business environments. I’ve fought hard to earn a seat at many leadership tables by not going with the status quo.  I did this through the kind of relationship building and servant leadership that we deserve to have in the House of Representatives.  I could continue to be voter with a limited voice but you should know I’m not that kind of person,  I am the kind of fighter that has to stand up when I see something wrong. And right now, we need a fighter for all Kentuckians, not just the 1%. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us in ways we never thought possible. I have been a vocal advocate for the stimulus packages to give more direct payments to Americans, provide rent subsidies, and to stop funneling cash to wall street. This crisis has shown us we need elected officials who will stand up for everyday Americans. Stimulus packages should be bailing out the kitchen table, not the boardrooms.\n\nOne of the most important things we must change is making sure healthcare coverage is NOT tied to employment. I believe in the creation of a public option to help make healthcare affordable. The existence of healthcare advocates and rising prescription drug costs within our system demonstrates how much our sick loved ones are exploited by the current system. Kentuckians deserve more from their government. It’s time for our representation to work to meet our needs and protect us from the burgeoning threat of medical bankruptcy.\n\nThis Pandemic has created unprecedented levels of unemployment. I believe we should take a lesson from FDR’s public works projects. We can empower Americans with good jobs at a wage that can support families. We can invest in our infrastructure and allow America to be the world leader in climate-friendly 21st century infrastructure. We can no longer ignore the economic, and tragic human toll that climate change is taking on our communities and our world. The United States has always led the world through innovation, it is time for us to do so again. Along with renewable energy projects, we have to update our infrastructure to give broadband access to under served communities. We must also ensure that clean water access is available to every household.\n\nEducation is the foundation and lifeblood of our democracy and is required to sustain our republic. I believe in a fully funded public education system where our educators are treated and respected like the highly skilled professionals that they are. I believe in an education system that works to create equity in our society to combat the stereotypes and discrimination of the past. A public education system should provide the same quality education to all students, and not just those in affluent areas. Our children are our future, and our representation in Congress should work to always give them the best opportunities possible. With the Pandemic, I must ask, whose children did we leave behind? With at home learning suddenly being required, how do children without broadband access learn? Kentucky’s average connection speed is lower than what is required to sustain video conferencing. This is why I am focused on broadband being included in any infrastructure bills.\n\nThank you to [r/Kentuckypolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentuckypolitics/), [r/VoteDEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/), and [r/Kentucky](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/) being such gracious hosts. As well as all of you for your questions and feedback. We can do this together.",
