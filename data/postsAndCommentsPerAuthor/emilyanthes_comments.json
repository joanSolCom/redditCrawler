And there was an emphasis on providing patients with sunlight and plenty of access to nature. (Florence Nightingale was one prominent proponent of these ideas.) And for a while, they did become standard. \n\nBut we abandoned a lot of these ideas in the 20th century, as germ theory took hold and technology improved. Instead of fighting illness with light and air, we started building hermetically sealed hospitals and using chemicals as disinfectants. But it turns out that those early architects and nurses were onto something, because light and air (and nature) can really have a hugely beneficial effect for hospital patients. Fortunately, this pendulum is beginning to swing back the other way, and hospitals are now trying to make much more of an effort to bring light, air, and nature into their buildings.\n\nThis trend has been most obvious in hospitals, but something similar has happened in other buildings too.

Distraction: The overheard sounds of other workers—*especially* the sound of a one-sided telephone call—can be really distracting and make it hard to concentrate.

Morale: Often a side effect of the distraction issue, but workers tend to hate open offices, and that can have its own knock-on effects on performance and productivity.\n\n3. Communication: This is still a bit of a debate, but one reason that many companies have pushed for open offices (aside from the fact that they’re much cheaper) is because they believe having all employees sitting together in an open environment will encourage cooperation, collaboration, and communication. And some studies have documented some of these benefits, but others have found the opposite effect. For instance, after one major Fortune 500 company moved from closed to open offices, researchers found that face-to-face interaction plummeted more than 70 percent. Workers started using more digital communication (like direct messages and emails) instead.\n\n4. Physical health: Germs spread much more easily in open environments, and workers take more sick days when they work in open offices.

There’s a *ton* of evidence that daylight helps boost mood—one study even found that people who were hospitalized for depression were actually discharged sooner when they were assigned to a room on the “sunny” side of a hospital.
