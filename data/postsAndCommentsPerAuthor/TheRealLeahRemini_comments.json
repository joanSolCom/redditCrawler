[chuckles]\n\nLeah - That’s disgusting, Mike. Anyway. I was called in by Tom Davis and I was taken off The Way to Happiness float here in Hollywood. \n\nMike - [haha] Well, that’s okay. I’ve got a story about this that I’m not sure that I should really tell. \n\nLeah - What?\n\nMike - When Quentin Tarantino approached John Travolta for a role in ‘Pulp Fiction,’ John asked me to review the script to tell him what I thought. His role was a heroin addict assassin and I said, “Oh John, I don’t think you should do this.”\n\nLeah - Oh, really?\n\nMike - Yeah.\n\nLeah - What a putz. [haha]\n\nMike - Great career advice. I should be an agent.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nLeah - But he took it anyway, so that’s good.\n\nMike - He ignored me.\n\nLeah - Thank god. \n\nMike - Sensibly, he ignored me.\n\nLeah - But I do want to answer this question about celebrities being treated differently. And there are not a lot of celebrities in Scientology. I really want you to think about this for a second because I don’t know of another religion that uses their celebrities as much as Scientology does and that’s very purposeful because it gives you the idea that there are a lot of scientologists who are successful because of Scientology. But there’s a lot more Catholics, there’s a lot more people who are Jewish. You don’t really know people’s religions and I agree with that, but how would you say that, Mike? Because you know how celebrities are treated in comparison to the average scientologist. \n\nMike - I mean, in a word... stroked. \n\nLeah - Totally.\n\nMike - What happens with celebrities in Scientology is they are given incredible deference and special treatment. They’re looked after like they’re the most important people in the world. \n\nLeah - Very.\n\nMike - I think that that is what Scientology plays on with celebrities and then in exchange for that they feel that they’ve got to go out there and tell the world about how great Scientology is. They are actively pressured to do that. \n\nLeah - Right.\n\nMike - The difference with celebrities is if you’re on a TV show for nine years and Kevin James has not become a scientologist, everybody in the world knows that Kevin James is not a scientologist, so Leah, you’ve failed. \n\nLeah - Yes, and people are going to ask that, too. How come you didn’t get Kevin James in? Kevin was very loyal to his religion. There was no in. And I was asked that many times. You’re telling me he has no failed purpose? He has no relationship problems? I was like, “He doesn’t, he doesn’t, he doesn’t.” He even said to me once, “Don’t try to get me into your Tom Cruise glare, man.  You can’t.” There was no in. I didn’t feel right about doing it. I didn’t ever feel right about telling somebody that they were lost and they needed Scientology. I just did it within the “church.” I helped scientologists who were already in to get them to their next level. I felt that that was an acceptable transgression against mankind. \n\nMike - [chuckles]",

That friend or family member would then be required to write an internal report on me, basically alerting the “Church” that I was having disaffected feelings towards my church and that I would be considered an enemy. So, if you had voiced any concerns to a family member, a husband, a wife, a child, they’re taught to believe that by turning you in they’re helping you because they believe in their hearts that you are lost and you are in trouble. People would say that a lot, “Leah, you’re in trouble. You need help.” They’d say things like that to me. “You need help.” Could you imagine a family member going “You need help”? But I’m like, I need help? You need f**king help. And then I would seem crazy because I would get emotional and passionate about it. I would be like, “I don’t need help. You need help. You need to look at this email.” And two of my closest friends, one of these people I considered like a father to me, I’d go to these people that I considered family members, and I said, “Listen, Debbie Cook, she’s the captain of the Flag Service Org, she sent out this email. Did you read it?!” I said. The wife says, “Why would I read that? Why would I read that crap?” I go, “It’s the captain, your captain of the Flag Service Organization. Why wouldn’t you read it?” She goes, “Because I wouldn’t want to read anything that’s negative about my church.” I go, “But you don’t know what she said!” “Well, I heard about it from the Church.” So, the Church intercepted this email and said, “Listen, if you see an email from Debbie Cook, delete it. She’s an evil person. She was committing crimes in the Sea Org.” Whatever they tell you. So, I go to these people and I say, “Have you looked on the Internet? Have you looked at these emails? Have you heard of the allegations?” and Scientologists will turn you in. They will simply turn you in. It doesn’t matter if it’s your child, if it’s your mother, your father, your husband, they will just turn you in and they will tell you “I’m writing a report on you.” And you go, “Go ahead.” Then you get called in, you get interrogated, and unless you’re willing to walk out the door that minute and lose everything you’ve ever known and your family, you usually just say, “Okay, fine, I won’t look anymore.” \n",

The hole is the place where people at the international base were kept 24/7 under guard. There was a big conference room that had a big table in it and the carpet there was industrial strength carpet and people, myself included, were made to crawl around on their hands and knees around this big table and eventually your hands become bloodied and your knees become bloodied and the next day you’re doing it again, so it never really heals. I still have a little scar on my left knee from doing that.\n\nLeah: And that was just usual? That was just everyday?\n\nMike Rinder: Yeah.\n\nLeah: Other than being punched and slapped and ridiculed?\n\nMike Rinder: Yup.\n\nLeah: When I was in Scientology, I used to hear information about Sea Org members saying that they were abused. I remember thinking if that were true then the police would be raiding this place and the FBI would be doing something. If this were true, how come no one has done anything about it? And I want you to talk about that.\n\nMike Rinder: The primary reason is because people within in Scientology are indoctrinated heavily. The law enforcement, the FBI, the police, they’re all horrible, suppressive people. So, the concept of even going to them is something that just never enters the mind of a Scientologist. \n\nLeah: Not to mention, your doctrine says if you prosecute a Scientologist, you will be expelled and shunned. So, there’s the fear of losing your family and everything you’ve ever known.\n\nMike Rinder: I actually wrote an article on my blog that is called “[Dealing with Critics of Scientology – The L. Ron Hubbard Playbook](http://www.mikerindersblog.org/dealing-with-critics-of-scientology-the-l-ron-hubbard-playbook/).” It has all of these documents in there.\n\nLeah: I want people to see this! I don’t want to be just like Scientology and say, “Believe me.” I don’t need you to believe me. I need you to google it yourself. \n\nMike Rinder: I need you to believe Scientology. Go look at their stuff. \n\nLeah: Go look at their policies. Go google “Scientology and disconnection,” “Scientology and coerced abortions,” “Scientology and physical and mental abuse.” Just google it! Make your own decisions. I’m doing exactly the opposite of what the “Church” will tell its parishioners. \n\nAnd I’m sweating.

If you’re a public member, paying to get auditing to go from the beginning all the way up to OT8, the generally accepted number is about $360,000. \n\nLeah: So how do people do it who are not rich?\n\nJeffrey Augustine: They take out second and third mortgages on their homes or they live in apartments. They drive really crappy cars. If you ever go to a Scientology event, you will see a few wealthy cars and everything else are old cars. You sacrifice. You work extra jobs and you go without. \n\nLeah: Good point. You go without. And that’s what’s so painful. People are giving up living to finance their actual religion.\n\nJeffrey Augustine: L. Ron Hubbard said there’s nothing more valuable than Scientology. You’re asked to give up your retirement funds and college funds for your children. This is insane. ",

If you’re a public member, paying to get auditing to go from the beginning all the way up to OT8, the generally accepted number is about $360,000. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leah: So how do people do it who are not rich?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Augustine: They take out second and third mortgages on their homes or they live in apartments. They drive really crappy cars. If you ever go to a Scientology event, you will see a few wealthy cars and everything else are old cars. You sacrifice. You work extra jobs and you go without. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leah: Good point. You go without. And that’s what’s so painful. People are giving up living to finance their actual religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Augustine: L. Ron Hubbard said there’s nothing more valuable than Scientology. You’re asked to give up your retirement funds and college funds for your children. This is insane. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

[chuckles]\n\nLeah - That’s disgusting, Mike. Anyway. I was called in by Tom Davis and I was taken off The Way to Happiness float here in Hollywood. \n\nMike - [haha] Well, that’s okay. I’ve got a story about this that I’m not sure that I should really tell. \n\nLeah - What?\n\nMike - When Quentin Tarantino approached John Travolta for a role in ‘Pulp Fiction,’ John asked me to review the script to tell him what I thought. His role was a heroin addict assassin and I said, “Oh John, I don’t think you should do this.”\n\nLeah - Oh, really?\n\nMike - Yeah.\n\nLeah - What a putz. [haha]\n\nMike - Great career advice. I should be an agent.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nLeah - But he took it anyway, so that’s good.\n\nMike - He ignored me.\n\nLeah - Thank god. \n\nMike - Sensibly, he ignored me.\n\nLeah - But I do want to answer this question about celebrities being treated differently. And there are not a lot of celebrities in Scientology. I really want you to think about this for a second because I don’t know of another religion that uses their celebrities as much as Scientology does and that’s very purposeful because it gives you the idea that there are a lot of scientologists who are successful because of Scientology. But there’s a lot more Catholics, there’s a lot more people who are Jewish. You don’t really know people’s religions and I agree with that, but how would you say that, Mike? Because you know how celebrities are treated in comparison to the average scientologist. \n\nMike - I mean, in a word... stroked. \n\nLeah - Totally.\n\nMike - What happens with celebrities in Scientology is they are given incredible deference and special treatment. They’re looked after like they’re the most important people in the world. \n\nLeah - Very.\n\nMike - I think that that is what Scientology plays on with celebrities and then in exchange for that they feel that they’ve got to go out there and tell the world about how great Scientology is. They are actively pressured to do that. \n\nLeah - Right.\n\nMike - The difference with celebrities is if you’re on a TV show for nine years and Kevin James has not become a scientologist, everybody in the world knows that Kevin James is not a scientologist, so Leah, you’ve failed. \n\nLeah - Yes, and people are going to ask that, too. How come you didn’t get Kevin James in? Kevin was very loyal to his religion. There was no in. And I was asked that many times. You’re telling me he has no failed purpose? He has no relationship problems? I was like, “He doesn’t, he doesn’t, he doesn’t.” He even said to me once, “Don’t try to get me into your Tom Cruise glare, man.  You can’t.” There was no in. I didn’t feel right about doing it. I didn’t ever feel right about telling somebody that they were lost and they needed Scientology. I just did it within the “church.” I helped scientologists who were already in to get them to their next level. I felt that that was an acceptable transgression against mankind. \n\nMike - [chuckles]",

That friend or family member would then be required to write an internal report on me, basically alerting the “Church” that I was having disaffected feelings towards my church and that I would be considered an enemy. So, if you had voiced any concerns to a family member, a husband, a wife, a child, they’re taught to believe that by turning you in they’re helping you because they believe in their hearts that you are lost and you are in trouble. People would say that a lot, “Leah, you’re in trouble. You need help.” They’d say things like that to me. “You need help.” Could you imagine a family member going “You need help”? But I’m like, I need help? You need f**king help. And then I would seem crazy because I would get emotional and passionate about it. I would be like, “I don’t need help. You need help. You need to look at this email.” And two of my closest friends, one of these people I considered like a father to me, I’d go to these people that I considered family members, and I said, “Listen, Debbie Cook, she’s the captain of the Flag Service Org, she sent out this email. Did you read it?!” I said. The wife says, “Why would I read that? Why would I read that crap?” I go, “It’s the captain, your captain of the Flag Service Organization. Why wouldn’t you read it?” She goes, “Because I wouldn’t want to read anything that’s negative about my church.” I go, “But you don’t know what she said!” “Well, I heard about it from the Church.” So, the Church intercepted this email and said, “Listen, if you see an email from Debbie Cook, delete it. She’s an evil person. She was committing crimes in the Sea Org.” Whatever they tell you. So, I go to these people and I say, “Have you looked on the Internet? Have you looked at these emails? Have you heard of the allegations?” and Scientologists will turn you in. They will simply turn you in. It doesn’t matter if it’s your child, if it’s your mother, your father, your husband, they will just turn you in and they will tell you “I’m writing a report on you.” And you go, “Go ahead.” Then you get called in, you get interrogated, and unless you’re willing to walk out the door that minute and lose everything you’ve ever known and your family, you usually just say, “Okay, fine, I won’t look anymore.” \n",

The hole is the place where people at the international base were kept 24/7 under guard. There was a big conference room that had a big table in it and the carpet there was industrial strength carpet and people, myself included, were made to crawl around on their hands and knees around this big table and eventually your hands become bloodied and your knees become bloodied and the next day you’re doing it again, so it never really heals. I still have a little scar on my left knee from doing that.\n\nLeah: And that was just usual? That was just everyday?\n\nMike Rinder: Yeah.\n\nLeah: Other than being punched and slapped and ridiculed?\n\nMike Rinder: Yup.\n\nLeah: When I was in Scientology, I used to hear information about Sea Org members saying that they were abused. I remember thinking if that were true then the police would be raiding this place and the FBI would be doing something. If this were true, how come no one has done anything about it? And I want you to talk about that.\n\nMike Rinder: The primary reason is because people within in Scientology are indoctrinated heavily. The law enforcement, the FBI, the police, they’re all horrible, suppressive people. So, the concept of even going to them is something that just never enters the mind of a Scientologist. \n\nLeah: Not to mention, your doctrine says if you prosecute a Scientologist, you will be expelled and shunned. So, there’s the fear of losing your family and everything you’ve ever known.\n\nMike Rinder: I actually wrote an article on my blog that is called “[Dealing with Critics of Scientology – The L. Ron Hubbard Playbook](http://www.mikerindersblog.org/dealing-with-critics-of-scientology-the-l-ron-hubbard-playbook/).” It has all of these documents in there.\n\nLeah: I want people to see this! I don’t want to be just like Scientology and say, “Believe me.” I don’t need you to believe me. I need you to google it yourself. \n\nMike Rinder: I need you to believe Scientology. Go look at their stuff. \n\nLeah: Go look at their policies. Go google “Scientology and disconnection,” “Scientology and coerced abortions,” “Scientology and physical and mental abuse.” Just google it! Make your own decisions. I’m doing exactly the opposite of what the “Church” will tell its parishioners. \n\nAnd I’m sweating.
