I didn't know what exactly that entailed and how it would evolve, but I knew that I wanted more independence, more focus on positive/optimization than abnormal/sick care, and more public health/larger impact than 1:1 practice. Everything I've done has been aligned with those principles.\n\nI now balance my time with a 90-95/5-10/1% focus on running a company, private practice, and teaching, which works for me for now, but I adjust the practice up and down depending on my time demands with the company.

However, I think this is an overly narrow definition, versus if you look at mating behavior:\n\n[Geneticists](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/2/mongolia-genghis-khan-dna/) studying Y-chromosome data have found that nearly 8 percent of the men living in the region of the former Mongol empire carry y-chromosomes that are nearly identical and are descended from Ghenghis Khan. That translates to 0.5 percent of the male population in the world, or roughly 16 million descendants living today! There's also data that 8,000 years ago, [17 women reproduced for every 1 man](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success), and in more recent history has trended toward only 40% of men reproducing while 80% of women. Clearly some men dominate in terms of reproductive capability, and that can be considered 'alpha.'\n\nEven today, [Tinder data](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) shows the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men. You could argue that these top 20% of men are \"alpha\" in terms of their sexual market value.\n\nPhysiologically, I would argue you can quantify this through testosterone levels. In Healthy, Non-Obese, Young Men (age 19-39), I would subjectively label this as:\n\nDeficiency (&lt;2.5th percentile): &lt;264 ng/dl\n\nAverage (25-75th percentile): 428-645 ng/dl\n\n**Alpha (&gt;97.5th percentile): &gt;916 ng/dl**\n\nThus, optimizing testosterone levels pharmacologically can increase someone to close to this level, which provides the physiological substrate for alpha-like characteristics (more muscle, less body fat, more confident/friendly, more drive/less risk-averse, greater energy/vitality, greater sexual drive/libido).\n\nSome of the behavioral characteristics or qualities can be mimicked (fake it 'till you make it) in terms of what society values. Just look up what are considered masculine traits or is [considered attractive in men](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/PST_12.05.17.gender-02-00.png) (e.g. honesty/morality, ambition/leadership, strength/toughness, hardworking/work ethic, etc.). They can absolutely be learned to some degree, though it will come more natural to some, and there may be limits to how far you can go without changing your physiology as well.",

Depends on if it's driven by:\n\n**- Physiology** (low testosterone or hyperthyroid)\n\n**- Personality** (excessively high introversion or agreeableness, which you can asses on a [Big 5 factor inventory](https://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/)),\n\n**- Social anxiety** that's a more learned/conditioned emotional response.\n\nAn appropriate conceptualization of what is causing it then informs what the appropriate course of action/treatment is. Since I don't know in your case and I can't diagnose you online, I'm just going to speak at a high level. The most common scenario (by base rates) is just plain old social anxiety/learning history, which can easily be overcome through exposure therapy, which will help with interviews as well.\n\nYou can easily overcome this in 8-12 sessions with an ACT psychologist, or I recommend the [**The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Social Anxiety and Shyness**](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Anxiety-Shyness/dp/1608820807/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=act+social+anxiety&amp;qid=1595634777&amp;sr=8-2) workbook. In either case, you have to practice putting yourself in high-stress social situations, and finding a local public speaking group like a [**Toastmasters**](https://www.toastmasters.org/) can help provide the right forum to practice, practice, practice, until you achieve mastery. I'd say the goal is not to eliminate your anxiety, but to increasing your willingness to have it and not let it stop you from speaking confidently and assertively when it's important for you.",

        "body": "I'm not a Jungian, though I read and respect some NeoJungians like Dr. Robert Moore. My primary orientation that I teach and practice is Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT), which doesn't talk about ego directly, but more about the observer self, which is relevant and I'll discuss here:  \n In ACT theory, there actually three 'selves':   \n\n\\- Physical Self (body) \n\n \\- Thinking Self (mind)\n\n\\- Observing Self (the part of you that notices whatever your mind and body are doing)\n\n Most of us have a sense of our Physical Self, especially when we sense input like pain. It's easy to tell where \"you\" begin &amp; end based on feel.  The Thinking Self is where we create our sense of identity. It's how we or our friends describe us and what we affiliate with.\n\nHaving a coherent sense of self is a useful cognitive evolution.   It allows us to behave (especially in a value-driven way) more on auto-pilot.  You may say \"that's not what 'I' do\" or \"that's not the 'kind of person' 'I' am\" and act accordingly.\n\nBut the word \"overidentify\" suggests that when we overly buy into our identity (I'm a purely good person), &amp; do something bad that violates that, it creates ridigity &amp; suffering.  Versus: I'm a person with good &amp; bad parts, so I keep away from temptation &amp; choose to act good.\n\nBelieving your story too much is what's called \"self-as-content\" or the conceptualized self.   It's the self as the mind says it is, with all of its beliefs and biases, not as you actually are: a dynamic biopsychosocial being capable of much more than you consciously know.\n\n When we are mindful, we practice noticing/focusing on something, which is \"self-as-awareness\".   One step beyond is noticing there is a \"you\" that IS noticing. This is the \"observer self\" or \"self-as-context\": the pure consciousness that is the context for our experiences.\n\nWhen we experience our observer self, we literally get perspective (from our identity, thoughts, feelings, images, memories, &amp; sensations), and can \"hold them lightly/flexibly\".   Meaning we can CHOOSE to buy-in or opt-out, based on whether it's effective to in that situation.\n\nThus, in ACT terms 'fusing' with an identity can be interpreted as temporary ego strengthening to motivate someone to work hard (e.g. taking on an alter ego or persona or archetype for work), but we can also 'defuse' from it in order to avoid ego inflation (in recognizing it's not actually use, and reverting back to the observer self).",

        "body": "Hey bud!   \nGood question. I think your premise is a different from mine: I don't think I'd ever frame it as \"problems men suffer from that are specific to them and no other demographic.\" At a higher level, men and women generally have similar issues, though sometimes in differing degrees and ways, but we also have unique needs, drives, and tasks in life.\n\nMy focus on men is because there's a greater opportunity for men's health optimization (because of our unique biology) and greater need for community (because men at least in American society tend not to be good at making friends or having a strong sense of community).\n\nYou may have seen me on Twitter write about how young men follow influencers like Jordan Peterson (the wise father), Joe Rogan (the crazy uncle), Jocko Wilinick/David Goggins (the tough coach), because they lack these archetypical role models in their own lives.\n\nI believe this is symptomatic of men desperately craving the guidance of initiators into adulthood &amp; gurus fill the deep void. These influencers are merely symptoms of a deep thirst  for something that is ingrained in each and every one of us:  The desire to be initiated and guided in order to become a man/woman in resplendent fullness.  But why is this missing today?  Where have the initiators gone?\n\nFor economic prosperity, we sacrificed relational prosperity.  Our families &amp; communities have post-industrial atrophy.  Instead of fathers apprenticing sons into their family trade, fathers serve the corporation, and sons have no clue what they do.\n\nWe as human-beings are inherently social creatures, and are used to operating within cooperative circles of extended family, groups/gangs, villages/tribes, etc.  In modern societies, this has been largely destroyed in favor of the individual, nuclear family, &amp; nation-state.\n\nAs a result, sons get their father's temper after a long day at work, instead of their temperament.   Mr. \"Smith\" may be present, but not like how his grandfather taught him to shape a blade (&amp; molded his psyche in the process).   We all still want to be that \"good boy/girl\".\n\nNot only are family fathers absent in spirit, but so are meta-fathers in the role of the admired leader.   Many heads of state &amp; companies are corrupt and hardly personal role models to be emulated.  As a result, we have our modern \"sibling society.\"\n\nRobert Bly predicted the rise of the \"Sibling Society\". In the absence of literal fathers (who are away at work) and metaphorical fathers (leaders with moral authority), everyone acts like siblings who compete as rivals, not to be good, but to be famous.\n\n Bly predicted this back in 1995: a sibling society without parents, both literal &amp; metaphorical, becomes a competitive, status-seeking, society that is sick &amp; its citizens struggle.  \"It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society\" - Krishnamurti.\n\nBeyond adjustment, when we don't get our fundamental needs met, we have mental health issues.   We've replaced our \"primary satisfactions\"—meaningful connection &amp; community—with secondary satisfactions of amnesia (forgetting) &amp; anesthesia (addiction).\n\n[As Francis Weller said](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/478/the-geography-of-sorrow), we go numb to try to cope with the fact that we have not been granted what we need to thrive. The levels of addiction in our society are off the chart\n\nBut here's the crux of the whole dilemma:  We cannot blame our fathers for falling short.  It was never their sole responsibility to initiate us, but to provide us with safety, security, &amp; support.  We must understand this &amp; forgive them.\n\nIt was supposed to be the older men of the community serving as initiators: uncles, cousins, neighbors.  Older men who could see young men with clear eyes, and guide them through ritual initiation processes to become full men.  That's what's missing and the void being filled.\n\nIt is deeply telling that two of the biggest gurus of the last year, [J](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson)ordan Peterson &amp; Marie Kondo, literally tell their followers how to \"clean their rooms\".   Their adult followers dutifully obey, sparked with joy.  Aren't we just craving our fathers &amp; mothers' guidance?\n\nSociety vacillates between trust in institutions vs. individuals.  When institutions are distrusted, we look towards individuals instead, until we lose faith &amp; swing back. - [@gustai](https://twitter.com/gustai)  This is now a guru era. They're not created by social media, but merely empowered by it.\n\nWe are witnessing a market demand that taps into our psyches far deeper than just cool &amp; sexy influencers shilling products online.  In the age of delayed adolescence, we want gurus to provide a SERVICE to make us complete:  Initiating &amp; shepherding us into ADULTHOOD.\n\nThis can be abused, but I'm optimistic that the \"reluctant gurus\" with good intentions will both make a weighty profit &amp; also wield their power wisely.  As 'mass initiators' of the mobile era, they must uphold their sacred duty to initiate the new generation responsibly.\n\nI dub them \"initiator influencers\".   The ones that will last are those that aren't in it for a quick buck but are servant leaders.   They are conduits for nature's lessons that are passed down from teachers that came before them.  \n\n[On a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1hRz4LbNO0&amp;t=5264s), I said my role is to modernize &amp; iterate timeless wisdom for newer generations.

        "body": "Thanks for the question Ben. I have a whole podcast on this, which I recommend people check out: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-psychotherapy-can-become-mainstream/id1475197209?i=1000452720976](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-psychotherapy-can-become-mainstream/id1475197209?i=1000452720976)\n\nHere's the written version: therapy/coaching with a licensed professional doesn't have to be about mental illness at all, but PRODUCING more of what you want vs. COPING with issues. For example:\n\n1) More Money vs. Cope with job loss \n\n2) More Attractive vs. Cope with breakup \n\n3) More Confident vs. Low self-esteem\n\nDespite cultural programming, your primary development task in your 20s &amp; 30s is maximizing your \"sexual market value.\" Your efforts to attain a good job, money, fitness, clothes, social circles are status signals to ultimately find a quality partner &amp; genes for your kids.\n\nThus, the enormous time &amp; money young men &amp; women spend on fitness/training makes evolutionary sense. For it:  1. Increases physically attractiveness.  2. Improves your mood/hormones and thus more confidence/dominance.  3. Status signals you are a healthy &amp; hardworking mate.\n\nUnfortunately, what does therapy stereotypically signal?  1. You are mentally ill &amp; could make an unstable partner   2. You may have genes or parenting tendencies that may increase your future children's mental health issues  3. You are not resilient enough to cope on your own.\n\nThis may not be true or fair, but people use heuristics in the absence of more info.  Thus, most don't mention they are in therapy in their dating profile!  So my contrarian view is the only way to truly destigmatize mental health is NOT normalizing illness.  Here's why:\n\nAgain, it may not be justified, but nature isn’t fair.  Wanting to select a partner who is as robust as possible is not irrational.  Thus, the real way to destigmatize therapy is to rebrand it altogether:  Away from PATHOLOGY &amp; STIMGA and towards PERFORMANCE &amp; PRESTIGE.  How?\n\nThe best precedent is from professional sports coaches &amp; athletes:  Olympians, who are the best in the world, ALL have coaches, sometimes multiple, to guide &amp; program their training,   Despite the fact they are world-class experts and could coach themselves or even others!\n\nWhy?  1. Playing ≠ Coaching. Doing is important, but there is unique value in applying theory &amp; strategy.  2. Objectivity. You can't see what you're doing wrong (watching your form), you need an outside observer.  3. Curation. They find the best techniques so you can focus.\n\nSo why hasn't non-sports coaching taken off?  Unlike sports coaches, hucksters call themselves life or executive coaches who have no license other than questionable certifications.  The problem is they largely DO NOT produce outcomes. In fact, they often have negative value.\n\nPlus coaches don't add prestige like having a personal trainer that you'd brag about.  Back in the '60s, having a psychoanalyst was actually socially prestigious.  Partly because it signaled you had the time/money for reflection, but also that you were into self-improvement.\n\nI'm for increasing access to care, so I don't think the solution to prestige is exclusivity.  Gyms are a good example: You can go to Equinox for &gt;$200/mo or 24H for &lt;$20/mo.   Ultimately, no one cares what gym you went to as long as you're fit &amp; healthy.  Same for coaching.\n\nWhat we need are LICENSED mental health professionals who re-brand &amp; re-orient themselves as being focused on PERFORMANCE. And augment themselves using software &amp; hardware to track &amp; iterate on outcomes to PROVE they're producing outcomes &amp; how that ranks relative to others.\n\n So think about it like hiring a sports coach:  You go to a coach because you want them to supervise you becoming a successful athlete &amp; using scientific programming to get you there.  If you HAPPEN to be injured or get injured, a good coach will ALSO work with or around that.\n\nBut injury is not THE REASON you go to a coach, it's something a coach deals with as needed, using a support staff of doctors/PTs/masseuses to augment them.  The ideal mental health program is the same way: you focus on performance AND deal with serious issues as needed.",

This is not medical advice, so I'll just speak in general:\n\n\\- An annual physical exam is usually covered by most health insurance, and gives you a good chance to establish a relationship with a primary care provider. Most people aren't diligent about this, but it's usually no-to-low cost so get it done ASAP and on-time every year.\n\n \\- Your provider should determine this, but often a routine blood test includes a CBC, CMP, and lipid panel. Thyroid tests are not usually done routinely unless there's some indication for it (e.g. low energy, high anxiety), but can be good to check. Also not routine and may not be covered by insurance is a hormone panel (e.g. total testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, free testosterone (or SHBG &amp; Albumin so you can calculate free testosterone)), but its useful information for most men and can be paid for out of pocket. Vitamin D is good to check to make sure you're in an optimal range and you're getting enough from sunshine, food, and any supplements you may be taking. Once you've dialed it in, doesn't need frequent rechecking.\n\n \\- [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm) 150 of moderate physical activity (brisk walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (jogging or running) a week + 2 days a week of muscle strengthening activities (that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms). If you're doing vigorous weight training, you can combine these recommendations as you're killing two birds with one stone.\n\nI personally like to break it out this way. I think the human body needs different intensity of activity:\n\n\\- LOW (walking daily: 30 min or \\~7,500 steps)  \n\n\\- MED (strength training, 3-5 days/week)\n\n\\- HIGH (interval training 1x/week like sprinting or a sport like basketball)\n\n As for bodyweight training, I recommend [JT's Body Weight Strength Training Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPEAhtSZDkTb0rDGrtaSU7A).

        "body": "Great question. Much of my research has been in mind-body medicine (e.g. PsychoNeuroImmunology) and I think the major lesson is that it's not accurate nor useful to distinguish between mind and body (and spirit). This is very much a byproduct of Cartesian mind-body dualisms (that artificially divides them as distinct) while Eastern traditions do not.\n\nAs a behaviorist, my frame of reference is  more on concrete and observable behaviors, rather than getting too metaphysical. When working with clients, I focus on what I call the \n\n**5 foundational health behaviors:**\n\n**- Nutrition**\n\n**- Exercise**  \n\n**- Sleep**  \n\n**- Focus**  \n\n**- Relationships**\n\nLike with your question, I often get asked where to start (can sometimes I prioritize as I did for the medical intern/resident above), but I generally recommend starting with a sixth and penultimate behavior:\n\nThe most important health behavior is **KEEPING YOUR WORD TO YOURSELF.**  The golden rule is: \"Do unto others, as you would do unto yourself.\"  The PLATINUM rule is: \"DO UNTO YOURSELF, as you would do unto others!\"  If you wouldn't let other people down, why would you let yourself down?!\n\nHere's how to do it: take RADICAL RESPONSIBILITY.  That means when you tell yourself you're going to do something, YOU DO IT. NO MATTER WHAT.  When I say I'm going to the gym today, I do it. Even if means going at 1AM.  Even if gym's closed, I exercise via bodyweight at home.\n\n In the short term, it's a bit punitive, because if you procrastinated all day, it is a pain and will eat into your sleep to go work out late.  Short-term, it forces PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY.  Long-term, the threat of pain actually prevents future procrastination.\n\nThis is the part that's a little meta: the trick is that you have to not treat you as ONE self, but multiple EXTERNAL selves/egos/archetypes/energies &amp; elicit their cooperation.  Imagine you're a father (king) to 3 rambunctious boys (a trickster/dummy, a mama's boy/dreamer, a bully/coward).  Never LIE to your kids. But…\n\nBalance AUTHORITY with AFFECTION.  Meaning, when you tell them you're going to take then to the gym or park, you DO NOT LET THEM DOWN.  In return for your integrity, they'll cooperate IF you also empathically listen to them and reward them with what they like.\n\nFor example, it's not realistic to be a tyrant king and try to force them to run a marathon every day.   Your 'kids' (ego states) will protest and if you try to drag them along, they'll come kicking and screaming (and manifest as lack of willpower and somatic pain).  Failure.\n\nSo elicit their input, get them to buy-in by reasonably compromising (1 mile/day), but you make the final decision as the archetypical leader/father/king.  If they cooperate once you get going, reward them by letting them have fun &amp; guilt-free play as well.  That's AFFECTION.\n\nOver time, you'll build a relationship and understand what their preferences &amp; limits are, and how to encourage them and get them to push their limits, as any good parent does.  Self-leadership starts with integrity. If you don't respect your(selves), you won't respect others.\n\nIf you want to put this into practice, I suggest implementing it with THE KEYSTONE HABIT:   Writing your personal commitments and keeping accountability to your 'selves':\n\n[https://medium.com/goactualize/this-4-minute-keystone-habit-can-transform-your-next-4-years-3a69822c254a](https://medium.com/goactualize/this-4-minute-keystone-habit-can-transform-your-next-4-years-3a69822c254a)",

When working with clients, I focus on what I call the &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 foundational health behaviors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Focus&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like with your question, I often get asked where to start (can sometimes I prioritize as I did for the medical intern/resident above), but I generally recommend starting with a sixth and penultimate behavior:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important health behavior is &lt;strong&gt;KEEPING YOUR WORD TO YOURSELF.&lt;/strong&gt;  The golden rule is: &amp;quot;Do unto others, as you would do unto yourself.&amp;quot;  The PLATINUM rule is: &amp;quot;DO UNTO YOURSELF, as you would do unto others!&amp;quot;  If you wouldn&amp;#39;t let other people down, why would you let yourself down?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how to do it: take RADICAL RESPONSIBILITY.  That means when you tell yourself you&amp;#39;re going to do something, YOU DO IT. NO MATTER WHAT.  When I say I&amp;#39;m going to the gym today, I do it. Even if means going at 1AM.  Even if gym&amp;#39;s closed, I exercise via bodyweight at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the short term, it&amp;#39;s a bit punitive, because if you procrastinated all day, it is a pain and will eat into your sleep to go work out late.  Short-term, it forces PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY.  Long-term, the threat of pain actually prevents future procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the part that&amp;#39;s a little meta: the trick is that you have to not treat you as ONE self, but multiple EXTERNAL selves/egos/archetypes/energies &amp;amp; elicit their cooperation.  Imagine you&amp;#39;re a father (king) to 3 rambunctious boys (a trickster/dummy, a mama&amp;#39;s boy/dreamer, a bully/coward).  Never LIE to your kids. But…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Balance AUTHORITY with AFFECTION.  Meaning, when you tell them you&amp;#39;re going to take then to the gym or park, you DO NOT LET THEM DOWN.  In return for your integrity, they&amp;#39;ll cooperate IF you also empathically listen to them and reward them with what they like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, it&amp;#39;s not realistic to be a tyrant king and try to force them to run a marathon every day.   Your &amp;#39;kids&amp;#39; (ego states) will protest and if you try to drag them along, they&amp;#39;ll come kicking and screaming (and manifest as lack of willpower and somatic pain).  Failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So elicit their input, get them to buy-in by reasonably compromising (1 mile/day), but you make the final decision as the archetypical leader/father/king.  If they cooperate once you get going, reward them by letting them have fun &amp;amp; guilt-free play as well.  That&amp;#39;s AFFECTION.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, you&amp;#39;ll build a relationship and understand what their preferences &amp;amp; limits are, and how to encourage them and get them to push their limits, as any good parent does.  Self-leadership starts with integrity. If you don&amp;#39;t respect your(selves), you won&amp;#39;t respect others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to put this into practice, I suggest implementing it with THE KEYSTONE HABIT:   Writing your personal commitments and keeping accountability to your &amp;#39;selves&amp;#39;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/goactualize/this-4-minute-keystone-habit-can-transform-your-next-4-years-3a69822c254a\"&gt;https://medium.com/goactualize/this-4-minute-keystone-habit-can-transform-your-next-4-years-3a69822c254a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Hi there, thanks for the Twitter follow. Let me start out by saying this is not medical advice, but I'll talk about lactose tolerance in general and some possible mechanisms:\n\nThere's a strong genetic component to lactose tolerance/intolerance, in that if you're Caucasian (European or Middle Eastern ancestry, where they did a lot of shepharding), you likely inherited genes that allow for better lactose tolerance vs. Asian populations). The fact that you could tolerate 4 pints previously suggests that you have the genetic capability to tolerate lactose.\n\nThe thing that most people miss is that beyond your genetic capability, production of the lactose enzyme gets upregulated or downregulated based on demand. Even folks with lactose tolerance can lose if if they are not regularly consuming dairy (as someone with Caucasian ancestry myself, I've experienced this myself when I stop drinking milk--if you don't use it, you lose it).  What I speculate may have happened with you is that upon moving to Japan, you consumed less dairy than usual, or may have taken a break from it for a period, and then suddenly going back to \"a couple of pints in one day\" may have shocked your system, which hadn't been producing sufficient enzymes to tolerate it, which resulted in the symptoms you're describing. I don't know this to be the case because I don't know the regularity and quantity of your use, just saying it's a possibility.  \n\n\nYou may want to experiment with weaning yourself back onto it. Don't drink a few pints per day, that's a lot for almost anyone to handle. Try a glass, see if that is tolerable, and increase by a glass a day until you start re-experiencing your symptoms, and that may be your body's tolerance level. I'd go slightly under that either live with that level, or titrate up slowly (maybe an ounce at a time, to give your body time to develop more lactase enzyme).\n\nSoy milk may be fine in smaller quantities, but it's garbage nutritionally as it;s lacking in protein unless fortified so I don't see what the point is. There is a [documented medical case study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18558591/) of a man developing gynomastia drinking 3 quarts/day (6 pints/day). Now that's a lot of soy milk, but it's only 1.5X more than what you're describing in terms of your 4 pints/day of milk, so you're approaching that territory if you've swapped soy milk as a 1:1 substitute. \n\nI don't know if ultra-filtered milk is available in Japan, but I would buy that instead. In the US, it's milk that's essentially filtered to have no lactose, and is lower in carbs, and higher in protein, but otherwise looks and tastes just like milk. Fairlife is the brand that's most common here, so maybe there's something equivalent in Japan.",

If you wanted to play that game, [I can point to](https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/1115295662474575873/photo/1) associational data that shows that a diet high in red meat is one of the least important dietary predictors of mortality). Much of the 'red meat scare' comes from flawed studies--I have not been able to find a single properly conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) that shows that meat causes cancer or heart disease.\n\nIn fact, [this meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27881394/) of 24 well-done, gold-standard Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), which are properly controlled, **shows no association between daily meat consumption and \\[intermediate\\] cardiovascular risk biomarkers**. Thus, I don't think we should shy away from red meat for health reasons, as long as its from a quality source and not cooked in refined vegetable oils (which may be confounding some of the associational data mentioned earlier).\n\nI encourage folks in general to eat a variety of animal-based proteins because they are the [most bioavailable](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57fe525b03596e2b9c21d848/1508949389575-JIMZNF71OT60MUPRW5LK/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHE0sHe0oygY00r17cQGnc9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIoK5KbiwhlgK383xFE_r5KCvdcfqUs8Z5cWoEknBFCsE/DIAAS+Scores.png) (in terms of their DIAAS scores) : red meat from ruminant animals, poultry, fish, shellfish, dairy (preferable fermented like greek yogurt if tolerable, otherwise lactose-free varieties like kefir or ultrafiltered milks like Fairlife are commonly available in supermarkets).

        "body": "Hi Doc!  \nCongrats on starting your intern year--that's always the toughest. FYI, I did my doctorate in clinical psychology, not med school, but it is structured like an MD/PhD program, except we do our clinical work and research concurrently, so it forces you to learn time management. I am a med school clinical professor now that trains PGY4s, so I'm pretty familiar with how your education is set up since I'm actively involved in it.\n\nThe question of balance is always a tough one, because as an intern/resident, you don't own control of your schedule, especially when it comes to call. In that circumstance, the unfortunate reality is there will always be some sacrifice required. Here's how I would prioritize:\n\n**1) SLEEP:** this really is the foundational health behavior, so try to get as much as you can (check out my [sleep optimization](https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/1189694113714622464?s=20) thread for tips, I'll eventually move this over to Reddit). Call is definitely disruptive to sleep and your circadian rhythm, so consider judicious use of melatonin (I prefer 0.3 mg sustained release, which mimics the physiological dose, obviously in consultation with your own provider) can help regulate your rhythm, and naps can help you address sleep debt (though be careful of napping too long and too close to bedtime if it interferes with your ability to fall asleep).\n\n**2) EXERCISE:** You're tired as a resident, so you have to adjust your routine to be as high 'bang-for-your-buck' as possible, while being realistic with your energy levels. 3x week of strength training is ideal. I would try to do full body workouts, but keep it brief (30-45 minutes) and only as taxing as your sleep and energy levels permit. If you're tired, ADJUST the routine so you're doing lighter weight, less reps, or less sets so your perceived exertion is not so high that you end up procrastinating or skipping your workouts. It's really okay to do a workout half as hard if you're tired. Don't dread it and have it psychologically turn into begrudging labor (you're already do that enough at work!)\n\nThe other trick is that with a 3x/week schedule, you can be flexible about days you're actually working out. If you're post-call, it's smart to move your workout to a day after you've gotten more rest. If you're rounding or on wards, you can naturally get enough steps (7,500/day is in line with CDC recs), so that should be plenty.\n\n**3) RELATIONSHIP MAINTENANCE:** Here I'm separating relationship maintenance vs. relationship development here to be more nuanced with prioritization. Residents often make a mistake in not providing enough TLC to their relationships, and letting them atrophy or losing them altogether. When it comes to existing relationships (especially family and romantic partners), you have to be proactive and schedule time with them. The good news is that a little goes a long way (a 30 minute phone call with the parents, or a biweekly date night with your partner can do a lot). When it comes to close/best friends, the nice thing is that modern communication (texting/messaging) can help keep you in touch while you have downtime and doesn't have to be as scheduled.\n\nI do think it is important that you try to focus some of your conversations on two extremes: to be more deep/vulnerable about what you're going through if you have appropriate support that is empathic/understanding it (otherwise talk to to a therapist), and spend some of your conversations not talking about medicine at all and more about normal life so you can get your mind off of work!\n\nPS You don't need to keep up with everyone in your extended network during intern year, as that would be exhausting. Focus on [your handful of close friends](https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/975776470155984896?s=20) and maintaining those relationships as a priority.\n\n**4) STUDYING:** This is pretty individual/idiosyncratic to you in terms of what you're gunning for in terms of your residency (e.g. ROAD or prestigious specialities), are you going into academics, etc. Obviously don't fail your exams or other hurdles you gotta jump through, and schedule this time as much as you can. I find that doing a little each day is much easier than trying to study for 4 hours on a Saturday when you're burn out. Obviously as exam dates get closer, you can ramp this up and put in those extra hours, but I would calibrate accordingly.\n\n**5) RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT:** If you're in the position of being single or in a new city for your intern year and looking to make new friends, I think this is where more of the sacrifice happens (after all, I would put this is priority #5, given intern year is mostly about survival). This has to be personalized a bit--if you have stronger existing relationships, you can reprioritize this more, while if you're really alone, you certainly should prioritize it more to make sure you feel supported and maintain your mental well-being.\n\nI generally don't like the idea of [💩](https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/) where you eat (in terms of dating at work), but hospitals and medical centers are pretty big places where there's lots of people around that you don't really work with directly. If you're there all the time, hospital cafeterias are a great place to get to meet new people (whether friends, colleagues, or otherwise) if you can get over the social anxiety of approaching strangers. Given you're uniformed, most people are pretty open to speaking with staff, however peripheral as you are. Online dating is always an option too, and has the benefit of meeting people outside of health care, but I'm less of a fan of this option, as the time investment:ROI and quality is poor for someone who's busy.",

If you're feeling that your depression or anxiety is significantly bothering you or getting in the way of functioning at school, I suggest that you consider seek out health care services if you aren't already. \n\nMost universities have student psychological or counseling services that can help you with what you're going through, and have specific context and resources for students. I used to work in the UCLA Psychology Clinic working with students like yourself, and it was often tremendously beneficial.\n\nI can't provide specific medical advice here, but I can speak at a high level: there are good evidence-based workbooks that introduce you to concepts from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is an evidence-based psychotherapy I both teach and practice. I don't think it replaces counseling, but it can be a good supplement to it, or be helpful in the interim if you don't have access to care.\n\nA general ACT workbook I recommend is [Get out of Your Mind and Into Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Your-Mind-Into-Life/dp/1572244259/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=act+workbook+therapy&amp;qid=1595618165&amp;sr=8-3) by Dr. Stephen Hayes, who is one of the founders of ACT and has published hundreds of studies supporting his efficacy. [He has a 20 min TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o79_gmO5ppg) that is an emotionally provocative introduction to ACT and why he created it that may motivate you to look into it.\n\nThere's also [the Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Anxiety-Commitment/dp/162625334X/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=act+workbook+therapy&amp;qid=1595618165&amp;sr=8-5) that I recommend as  which is a bit more up-to-date, and more anxiety &amp; exposure-focused if you specifically want to work on that.\n\nIn any case, wishing you the absolute best, and use the community to continue to get extra support in addition to the traditional health care system!",

I agree that rituals are not just archaic &amp; antiquated superstition, but an important part of our collective unconscious that serves an important need for soothing, initiation, and bringing order to the chaos of our modern lives.\n\nThere's a popular trope now that [the cure for addiction is connection](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong?language=en).  Yes, lonely people are more likely to be addicted, but I have plenty of clients with meaningful relationships who are still addicted.  My unpopular opinion is that the cure for addiction is another 'addiction' (in the form of conscious, freely-chosen ritual that replaces unconscious or compulsive ritual).\n\nUnfortunately, we've swung from biological determinism (addiction is a brain disease) to social determinism (if you just give people the right environment, everyone will be cured).  The reality is addiction is biopsychosocial AND it requires different things for different people.\n\nSome addictions are truly biological (genetic predisposition/personality) and their drug of choice has created physiological dependence. We shouldn't tell these poor folks: \"all you need is love.\"  While digital addictions tend to be more psychological avoidance &amp; respond better.\n\nWhen working with clients, I do a root cause analysis: are they using addiction to numb an underlying pain caused by trauma, loneliness, anxiety, etc? I then treat that directly.  Sometimes that's not enough for folks who just have addictive &amp; especially compulsive tendencies.\n\nWith those folks, they're probably always going to be a little extreme, short of significant life changes (marriage, children, new job that requires sinking or swimming).  Thus, we teach them to sublimate their addiction into a new addiction that is healthier or more productive.\n\nA great example of this is Eminem, who was addicted to opiates and sleeping medication (reportedly taking up to 60 Valium and 30 Vicodin pills a day).  In addition to rehab, he started running as his new addiction--up to 17 miles a day--as a healthier coping mechanism.\n\nThe danger is one can overdo the new addiction as well. Eminem was starting to get injured from all the running, so he toned it down, but still exercises fastidiously in order to channel his addictive personality into a more productive fashion.   Thus, find what works for you.\n\nIf you don't consciously engage in ritual (e.g. a daily exercise routine), the theory goes that body will unconsciously engage in ritual for you because that's what we are wired to do.   If you've ever seen anyone smoke crack or shoot heroin, they prepare their supplies ritualistically &amp; lovingly.\n\nRitual is the body's way of self-soothing, so it is paramount that we consciously engage in ritual: to reduce our stress, to unwind from work, to attenuate our worries, to fall asleep.  Otherwise, we can fall prey to addictions &amp; compulsions to get our needs met &amp; with harm.\n\n**Thus, I teach clients to create their own conscious rituals that are:**   \n\n**- intrinsically motivating (should be enjoyable)**  \n\n**- immediately rewarding (reinforcing in the moment)**  \n\n**- engages the 5 senses (open a scented sparkling water if you're replacing problematic drinking, listen to music to unwind, etc.)**  \n\n**- ritualistic (same pattern repeated in a familiar way)**  \n\n\nHappy to talk more about this, but I also want to add that rituals are also conducted at the group level (think of initiation rituals or the eucharist in the Christian tradition). It will be fun to come up with some rituals for r/MaximusTribe as well.",

KWML is one of my favorite recommended reads, so glad you picked it up (for others reading it, I recommend the book, or you can read a [summary here](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/king-warrior-magician-lover-introduction/).\n\nIf you look at [the four archetypes](https://stottilien.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/shadowtrinangle.jpg), the model is useful in conceptualizing some of the errant or pathological behavior today. For example, an adult who is sadistic (hurts other people) or is masochists (hurts themselves) is posited to be an example of the extreme polarities of the warrior archetype. This is a man who has no problem taking action, in fact, takes a lot of action, but doesn't channel or sublimate this energy in a positive, prosocial, or productive way. Rather, he uses it in a way that's abusive to himself or others. I think the recognition of that process, and that these energies essentially need a container to hold them and channel them properly.\n\nIf you listen to [Dr. Robert Moore's speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbCp_37wazM), he describes the process of therapy as helping the client essentially build the \"container\" or \"cup\" to hold those energies, without being overwhelmed or 'possessed' by them. Thus, I do recommend therapy/coaching with a licensed clinical psychologist who can help identify some of your habits that may be less mature, and work with you on developing more mature coping skills &amp; emotional resilience (what I would call 'the container') so that you can level up towards the mature masculine archetypes.  \n\n\nBesides 1-on-1 work, I do think what's missing in American society today is the idea of community, which is why I built r/MaximusTribe (also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/maximustribe/) &amp; [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8FkPQ9u) as well), because men in particular have both less breadth and depth of social networks compared to women. And men especially benefit from having peer support and accountability in terms of getting guidance on where they may have blind sports or are falling short. So I suggest talking about more of that here in these communities and we can help support you in your development, just as we are developing ourselves (thus \"mutual improvement\").",

Thus, I do recommend therapy/coaching with a licensed clinical psychologist who can help identify some of your habits that may be less mature, and work with you on developing more mature coping skills &amp;amp; emotional resilience (what I would call &amp;#39;the container&amp;#39;) so that you can level up towards the mature masculine archetypes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides 1-on-1 work, I do think what&amp;#39;s missing in American society today is the idea of community, which is why I built &lt;a href=\"/r/MaximusTribe\"&gt;r/MaximusTribe&lt;/a&gt; (also on &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/maximustribe/\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/8FkPQ9u\"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; as well), because men in particular have both less breadth and depth of social networks compared to women. And men especially benefit from having peer support and accountability in terms of getting guidance on where they may have blind sports or are falling short. So I suggest talking about more of that here in these communities and we can help support you in your development, just as we are developing ourselves (thus &amp;quot;mutual improvement&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I launched this subreddit because I saw an unmet need in society for male community that is evidence-based and focused on mutual improvement. My thesis is that “self-improvement” was never meant to be done by yourself. Men traditionally had a band of brothers, a village, a tribe to initiate them into adulthood and help them develop into a mature masculinity, and we're re-creating that here. If you don't already follow my Twitter (@DrSepah), here's a little about myself:\n\nINTRO: I'm Dr. Cameron Sepah, CEO of Maximus (you can call me Dr. Cam or just Cam is fine). I'm based in sunny Santa Monica, CA, and a fun fact about myself is that when I was a doctoral student in LA, I was an adventure-seeker (big mountain climbing &amp; motorcycle riding). Nowadays, a casual hike &amp; surf break is more than enough excitement for me. I'm thrilled just to see men develop their potential :)\n\nEXPERTISE: I am a Licensed Clinical Psychologist &amp; Clinical Professor of Psychiatry by training. I have dual specialities in the treatment of anxiety disorders (e.g. Social Phobia, OCD, PTSD), and Behavioral Medicine (i.e. the behavioral treatment of chronic diseases like obesity &amp; diabetes). Part-time, I continue to train psychiatry residents in evidence-based behavioral psychotherapy like Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT), and have a private practice coaching executives (mostly tech CEOs &amp; VCs) to optimize their health &amp; performance.\n\nFull-time, I became a health tech entrepreneur, as the Founding Medical Director of Omada Health, where I helped pioneered the field of \"digital therapeutics.\" I trained hundreds of online health coaches to help 300,000 people lose 3 million pounds, and have published numerous papers showing you can help people with prediabetes achieve normal blood sugar through online treatment. That's why I know that online groups can be powerful agents for personal &amp; health change.\n\nWith my new company, Maximus, we're focused on providing services that optimize men in mind &amp; body. As part of that effort, we're launching these online communities public that provide peer support and coaching for physical, mental, relational, and professional health/wealth. I'll do my best to provide coaching from time-to-time (though cannot diagnose or treat any conditions here), and will lean on the great group of others who who have expertise or just life experience to generously share their wisdom as well. Let's make this community great!",
