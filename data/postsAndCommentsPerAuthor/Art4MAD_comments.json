        "body": "Tales from the Crypt was part of EC comics, and was started by Bill Gaines, not his father Max. Max was credited for publishing the first comic book in 1932, which were collections of comic strips rather than original stories. He and some partners later published, among other things, “Famous Funnies”, which is considered the first American comic book. Later Max started  “All American Publications”, which created characters like Wonder Woman and Green Lantern. He sold that to a partner who also owned “National Allied Publications”, and that merged company eventually became DC Comics. Still later Max started a company call “Educational Comics”, which published comic art retellings of Biblical and historical tales, and later funny animal and other stories under the “Entertaining Comics” label, both known as “E.C. Comics”. Max died in a boating accident in 1947, and his son Bill inherited the company. Bill started publishing more adult stories  with titles about relationships, war, crime, sci-fi, fantasy and horror, the latter including “Tales from the Crypt”. He also created MAD with Harvey Kurtzman. \n\nGaines and Kurtzman created MAD years before the senate hearings because Kurtzman wanted to make more money, so Gaines offered to let him do a humor title. MAD was the result.\n\nMAD’s switch to a magazine format was not to avoid the Comics Code Authority but to keep Kurtzman from leaving EC. Kurtzman was never happy working in comics as the medium, targeted to kids and printed cheaply on bad paper, was looked down on as low-brow fodder. He wanted to work on a “slick”, as more prestigious magazines were then called because they were printed on glossy, “slick” stock. He had been lobbying Bill Gaines to make MAD a “slick” well before the Comics Code Authority reared its ugly head in 1954. Gaines refused mainly because of the expense and complexity of producing such a publication. After the hearings Gaines did NOT immediately stop publishing his E.C. titles (including MAD), but he could not get the CCA approval stamp and retailers refused to carry them. He discontinued the horror titles, which up until then had been the big money makers of the E.C. line of comic, renamed his main sci-fi title, and concentrated on his “New Direction” line which included M.D. and Psychoanalysis. MAD by then had (after starting out slow) caught on and was E.C.’s last remaining real success. The problem with MAD was that Kurtzman was still unhappy doing a lowly comic book. When Kurtzman was offered a job with the prestigious Pageant magazine as editor Harris Shevelson‘s right-hand man, Harvey went to Gaines to say he was going to take the job. Gaines recognized that without Harvey MAD was likely done, so he offered to do what Kurtzman had previously wanted… change MAD into a “slick”. It was blind coincidence (and good fortune) that the timing of that move also avoided the new Comics Code Authority entanglements. The real reason behind the move was to make Harvey Kurtzman happy and keep him with E.C. and MAD.",
