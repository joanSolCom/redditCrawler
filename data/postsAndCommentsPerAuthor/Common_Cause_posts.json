We'll keep going through and answering questions, and try to field additional ones as they come in!*\n\nYou can get involved by signing up as an [Election Protection volunteer](https://protectthevote.net), [visiting our website](https://commoncause.org) to get Common Cause alerts and updates, or [making a contribution in support of our work!](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/common-cause?source=reddit-102120)\n\n***\n\nHi Reddit! We are a team of non-partisan voting experts who have spent all year watchdogging our elections to prepare for November 3rd (and the days after, until the election is certified.)\n \nWe believe our right to vote is sacred, and that every eligible voter -- whether they're Republicans, Democrats, or Independents -- all deserve a say in our future.\n \nThis is an absolutely unprecedented election. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how elections are done -- officials face higher demand than ever for absentee ballots, and more election lawsuits have been filed than any previous year. That's on top of the same threats we've dealt with year after year -- like long lines at the polls, partisan voter suppression schemes, and the need to secure our elections against interference.\n \nThis year, we have been engaged in legislation, litigation and other efforts to help every voter be heard. We'll have thousands of nonpartisan volunteers in the field and remotely working to make sure voters know their rights. Plus, we'll be watchdogging social media for disinformation that could make it more difficult for people to vote.\n \nWant to know about the security and integrity of your ballot (absentee or in-person)? Curious about what a 'provisional ballot' is? Or how to 'cure' your ballot if something went wrong?\n \nWe're here to answer those questions and more. We are:\n \n- Sylvia Albert, Director of Voting and Elections at Common Cause. Sylvia manages Common Cause's work for safe, secure, and accessible elections, including our litigation against unfair or suppressive voting rules. She helps our state leaders enact reforms like Automatic Voter Registration that help every eligible voter participate in our democracy. \n \n- Susannah Goodman, Director of Election Security at Common Cause. Susannah leads our work to help secure our election systems against infiltration and manipulation -- and works directly with local election officials to make sure they're following best practices, like ensuring all votes cast leave a verifiable paper trail, and auditing results after the fact to confirm accuracy.\n \nWe're here to answer any question you have about how to safely cast your ballot (and make sure it counts!)\n \nThe most important thing you can do is make your plan to cast your ballot this year -- and use the tools on [our website](https://www.commoncause.org/voting-tools/) to make sure you're ready to be heard. You can also help your friends and family know their rights by sharing reliable information from trusted sources, like your state's Secretary of State's website.\n \nWant to get involved and help voters near you? You can sign up as an Election Protection volunteer at [protectthevote.net](https://protectthevote.net/).\n \nYou can also learn more about our work on our website, or our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CommonCause),[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CommonCause), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ourcommoncause/).\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/CommonCause/status/1318371206110871552",
