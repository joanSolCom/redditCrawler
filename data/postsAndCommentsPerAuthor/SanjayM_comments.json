        "body": "The first thing to realise is that thermoplastics have nearly a century of development and billions invested in their R&amp;D, the fundamental physics/chemistry of thermoplastics lends itself better to variety of properties and performance. More and more items are made from thermoplastics as time goes by and the performance of thermoplastics improves.\n\nSLA/Polyjet etc use UV curing resins. These are much less varied, much less performant and higher cost. Carbon 3D are having a good stab at changing this, but they have decades of R&amp;D to catch up on thermoplastics. I don't think that anyone is going to be making usefully strong and durable parts in their home using any printing system that uses UV curing materials anytime soon.\n\nFDM and SLS are the only machines making thermoplastic parts. SLS is very limited, mainly to nylons but some more materials are starting to creep in now like elastomers. However the cost is very high, and the powder handling is non-trivial. It's not terribly accessible.\n\nFDM can directly print most thermoplastics on the market, and done right a single machine can print a huge variety of materials. It also does so without any powders to handle or resins that need washing, post curing etc and generally suck to handle. FDM pumps out ready to use parts right off the build plate in most cases, sometimes there's supports to remove, but this is a safe and simple process. It also does so at a price point starting from a few hundred bucks.\n\nFDM has downsides, like poor part surface quality and detail compared to SLA etc. This is exactly what we are seeking to address with ASMBL. \n\nPeople poop on FDM all the time, and say that XYZ tech will soon surpass it. But look how many machines are being sold and used. FDM is winning, and I think that's because it's straightforward, it's low cost, and it is ***useful***. If you haven't guessed yet, I don't think FDM is going anywhere.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to realise is that thermoplastics have nearly a century of development and billions invested in their R&amp;amp;D, the fundamental physics/chemistry of thermoplastics lends itself better to variety of properties and performance. More and more items are made from thermoplastics as time goes by and the performance of thermoplastics improves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SLA/Polyjet etc use UV curing resins. These are much less varied, much less performant and higher cost. Carbon 3D are having a good stab at changing this, but they have decades of R&amp;amp;D to catch up on thermoplastics. I don&amp;#39;t think that anyone is going to be making usefully strong and durable parts in their home using any printing system that uses UV curing materials anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FDM and SLS are the only machines making thermoplastic parts. SLS is very limited, mainly to nylons but some more materials are starting to creep in now like elastomers. However the cost is very high, and the powder handling is non-trivial. It&amp;#39;s not terribly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FDM can directly print most thermoplastics on the market, and done right a single machine can print a huge variety of materials. It also does so without any powders to handle or resins that need washing, post curing etc and generally suck to handle. FDM pumps out ready to use parts right off the build plate in most cases, sometimes there&amp;#39;s supports to remove, but this is a safe and simple process. It also does so at a price point starting from a few hundred bucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FDM has downsides, like poor part surface quality and detail compared to SLA etc. This is exactly what we are seeking to address with ASMBL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People poop on FDM all the time, and say that XYZ tech will soon surpass it. But look how many machines are being sold and used. FDM is winning, and I think that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s straightforward, it&amp;#39;s low cost, and it is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you haven&amp;#39;t guessed yet, I don&amp;#39;t think FDM is going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Your extra images made us go back and check some things.\n\nIt's hard to tell if there is misalignment from the images, from what I can see things don't immediately appear misaligned. The idler is designed to float a little and when filament enters the idler aligns around it.\n\nIf the idler really is misaligned then I think it's unlikely that the pin is the cause - the way the pin is also constrained at the other end means that it is assured to be parallel etc. That's not to say that your problem isn't real, perhaps the idler is warped or some other thing we haven't seen yet. \n\nMade a blogpost to cover the known issues and resolutions. \nhttps://e3d-online.com/blog/2020/03/18/hemeraissues-and-clarification-update/\n\nThings I'd like to know:\n\n* 1) Are you using \"active loading\" (extruder turning forward as filament is inserted?) (Manual loading isn't really supported, and is quite difficult). See here: https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/Hemera+Filament+Loading/148?lang=en\n* 2) Does the heatsink fit onto the motor easily?\n* 3) How are you measuring the non-perpendicularity?

Sorry that I can't offer a replacement part for you at this time, but with the heatsinks and idlers that we have they all exhibit this issue to some degree. We'll get it nailed soon, I'm sure.\n\nIn the meantime I'd love to figure out why your Hemera isn't loading properly, as what you're describing isn't an issue we're seeing or tracking, so could be something new to us.

This has no impact on the alignment of the pin, the idler, or the rest of the drivechain whatsoever. \n\nWe are aware that it is an imperfection, and we're endeavouring to ensure that it doesn't happen in the future, but ultimately it's a small cosmetic defect hidden between the heatsink fins and behind a fan. \n\nWe are aware that a much smaller number of Hemeras are having some issues with gear alignment/tightness.

This is super interesting not just for colour, but for mixing the properties of materials. There are a lot of polymers that are miscible and can be blended with each other but have vastly different properties.

This is super interesting not just for colour, but for mixing the properties of materials. There are a lot of polymers that are miscible and can be blended with each other but have vastly different properties. So you might have a very soft material and a very rigid one, and by mixing them together you could get any level of softness or rigidity you wanted, on command.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Your extra images made us go back and check some things.\n\nIt's hard to tell if there is misalignment from the images, from what I can see things don't immediately appear misaligned. The idler is designed to float a little and when filament enters the idler aligns around it.\n\nIf the idler really is misaligned then I think it's unlikely that the pin is the cause - the way the pin is also constrained at the other end means that it is assured to be parallel etc. That's not to say that your problem isn't real, perhaps the idler is warped or some other thing we haven't seen yet. \n\nMade a blogpost to cover the known issues and resolutions. \nhttps://e3d-online.com/blog/2020/03/18/hemeraissues-and-clarification-update/\n\nThings I'd like to know:\n\n* 1) Are you using \"active loading\" (extruder turning forward as filament is inserted?) (Manual loading isn't really supported, and is quite difficult). See here: https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/Hemera+Filament+Loading/148?lang=en\n* 2) Does the heatsink fit onto the motor easily?\n* 3) How are you measuring the non-perpendicularity? (The sink is a pretty complex part to reference from, and has lots of draft angles etc)\n\nWe're working on a fix for the pin-breakthrough thing, but don't have a remedy yet. Hopefully soon. Sorry that I can't offer a replacement part for you at this time, but with the heatsinks and idlers that we have they all exhibit this issue to some degree. We'll get it nailed soon, I'm sure.\n\nIn the meantime I'd love to figure out why your Hemera isn't loading properly, as what you're describing isn't an issue we're seeing or tracking, so could be something new to us. If that means sending a new, perpendicularity checked sink, then we're totally happy to do that.",

The idler is designed to float a little and when filament enters the idler aligns around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the idler really is misaligned then I think it&amp;#39;s unlikely that the pin is the cause - the way the pin is also constrained at the other end means that it is assured to be parallel etc. That&amp;#39;s not to say that your problem isn&amp;#39;t real, perhaps the idler is warped or some other thing we haven&amp;#39;t seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made a blogpost to cover the known issues and resolutions. \n&lt;a href=\"https://e3d-online.com/blog/2020/03/18/hemeraissues-and-clarification-update/\"&gt;https://e3d-online.com/blog/2020/03/18/hemeraissues-and-clarification-update/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things I&amp;#39;d like to know:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1) Are you using &amp;quot;active loading&amp;quot; (extruder turning forward as filament is inserted?) (Manual loading isn&amp;#39;t really supported, and is quite difficult). See here: &lt;a href=\"https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/Hemera+Filament+Loading/148?lang=en\"&gt;https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/Hemera+Filament+Loading/148?lang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2) Does the heatsink fit onto the motor easily?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3) How are you measuring the non-perpendicularity? (The sink is a pretty complex part to reference from, and has lots of draft angles etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re working on a fix for the pin-breakthrough thing, but don&amp;#39;t have a remedy yet. Hopefully soon. Sorry that I can&amp;#39;t offer a replacement part for you at this time, but with the heatsinks and idlers that we have they all exhibit this issue to some degree. We&amp;#39;ll get it nailed soon, I&amp;#39;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I&amp;#39;d love to figure out why your Hemera isn&amp;#39;t loading properly, as what you&amp;#39;re describing isn&amp;#39;t an issue we&amp;#39;re seeing or tracking, so could be something new to us. If that means sending a new, perpendicularity checked sink, then we&amp;#39;re totally happy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The heater cartridge serves only to add power to maintain the constant commanded temperature of the block, and so if the heater is powerful enough to maintain that temperature as commanded it is broadly rendered irrelevant to the heat transfer and therefore the melt rate of the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Support should get back to you soon - they are super busy right now though, so may take a day or so yet. \n\n**Long answer:** - So there's an interesting engineering story here!\n\nThe lids are injection moulded from top-notch Makrolon brand Polycarbonate. Probably one of the toughest consumer grade plastics out there. PC is what you make safety goggles and bullet proof glass from, it almost never cracks, and tends to have a ductile yield.\n\nSo this cracking affair started to crop up a few months back - very small percentages of lids would crack after short usage or even in shipment. This is super freaking odd for PC.\n\nFirst thoughts were that the supplier had substituted the resin for something cheaper or not purged out the extruder properly, maybe hydrolysis from moisture or some other material defect. We went through every batch from every moulding run, took a hammer to them. All tough as nails, not possible to crack even if we tried.\n\nWe're stumped for a while - crack out the ishikawa diagram, do a lot of reading on PC and what makes it crack.\n\nEventually we come up with the theory that the lubricant in the bearings could be a potential cause of chemical degradation. Especially as all cracking is localised around this bearing. *This is not a fun thought at all.* Is every Titan out there a ticking chemical degradation timebomb? Balls.\n\nGet to talking to an engineer in the factory that makes and lubricates the bearings. Turns out they do chop and change lubricant every so often. Manage to get them to put the different oils and greases that may have been used over time into bottles and send them over from the factory.\n\nVacuum seal a bunch of lids in bags, with the aforementioned assortment of lubricants. These then go into a lab oven for a real hot supper of an accelerated failure inducement. Vacuum presses the lubricant onto/into the part, and heat accelerates any reaction that might take place.\n\nA few days later, lo and behold, we have cracks in one of the lids in a particular lubricant. Culprit found.\n\nMercifully it seems like very few bearings actually had this particular lubricant applied, and the effect takes place quickly and obviously. So no ticking time-bombs. Bearing manufacturer has been instructed on lubrication, and the problem has gone away since then. \n\nLooks like an old bearing etc somehow escaped quarantine or effective stock FIFO here on your part and has caused what you're seeing.\n\n",

Support should get back to you soon - they are super busy right now though, so may take a day or so yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long answer:&lt;/strong&gt; - So there&amp;#39;s an interesting engineering story here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lids are injection moulded from top-notch Makrolon brand Polycarbonate. Probably one of the toughest consumer grade plastics out there. PC is what you make safety goggles and bullet proof glass from, it almost never cracks, and tends to have a ductile yield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this cracking affair started to crop up a few months back - very small percentages of lids would crack after short usage or even in shipment. This is super freaking odd for PC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First thoughts were that the supplier had substituted the resin for something cheaper or not purged out the extruder properly, maybe hydrolysis from moisture or some other material defect. We went through every batch from every moulding run, took a hammer to them. All tough as nails, not possible to crack even if we tried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re stumped for a while - crack out the ishikawa diagram, do a lot of reading on PC and what makes it crack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually we come up with the theory that the lubricant in the bearings could be a potential cause of chemical degradation. Especially as all cracking is localised around this bearing. &lt;em&gt;This is not a fun thought at all.&lt;/em&gt; Is every Titan out there a ticking chemical degradation timebomb? Balls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get to talking to an engineer in the factory that makes and lubricates the bearings. Turns out they do chop and change lubricant every so often. Manage to get them to put the different oils and greases that may have been used over time into bottles and send them over from the factory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vacuum seal a bunch of lids in bags, with the aforementioned assortment of lubricants. These then go into a lab oven for a real hot supper of an accelerated failure inducement. Vacuum presses the lubricant onto/into the part, and heat accelerates any reaction that might take place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days later, lo and behold, we have cracks in one of the lids in a particular lubricant. Culprit found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mercifully it seems like very few bearings actually had this particular lubricant applied, and the effect takes place quickly and obviously. So no ticking time-bombs. Bearing manufacturer has been instructed on lubrication, and the problem has gone away since then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like an old bearing etc somehow escaped quarantine or effective stock FIFO here on your part and has caused what you&amp;#39;re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Should make for some really nice results.\n\nSlicers assume that volume extruded per step of the extruder is the same regardless of whether you are at constant velocity, accelerating or decelerating. However the system actually is more dynamic than that - during acceleration you get over extrusion and during deceleration you get under extrusion. \n\nThe total volume of material out of the hotend for a complete G1 move is theoretically correct, but the actual time position of when that material exits the nozzle is not evenly distrubuted along the G1 as the slicer expects.\n\nIdeally you want your extruder to be in steady state at all times during printing with minimal filament velocity change. Those fast accelerations should give you remarkably low extrusion volume error because there's so little acceleration time and reduce issues like over extrusion at corners. This combined with ball screws having near zero resonance or stretch like a belt is going to make for very sharp prints without ringing indeed.\n\nI'd be super interested to see your machine, is there a build log or similar out there?",

Should make for some really nice results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slicers assume that volume extruded per step of the extruder is the same regardless of whether you are at constant velocity, accelerating or decelerating. However the system actually is more dynamic than that - during acceleration you get over extrusion and during deceleration you get under extrusion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The total volume of material out of the hotend for a complete G1 move is theoretically correct, but the actual time position of when that material exits the nozzle is not evenly distrubuted along the G1 as the slicer expects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally you want your extruder to be in steady state at all times during printing with minimal filament velocity change. Those fast accelerations should give you remarkably low extrusion volume error because there&amp;#39;s so little acceleration time and reduce issues like over extrusion at corners. This combined with ball screws having near zero resonance or stretch like a belt is going to make for very sharp prints without ringing indeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be super interested to see your machine, is there a build log or similar out there?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For example you might define T0 as 100% white, and T9 as 100% black, then you can also define T2 as 80% white, 20% black etc etc. The you just issue a TX to switch to the colour mix ratio you want.\n\nWe also used repetier host to set up these prints, it has nice abilities for splitting models into sub-parts, and assigning extruders to particular objects. You just set it up as a multicolour extrusion print and the virtual extruders take care of the rest. I forget whether we used the Cura or Slic3r engine within repetier, but it wraps those up pretty nicely so you don't really end up dealing with them much.\n\nFrom there on out it's business as usual, take the GCode and print it.\n\n",

For example you might define T0 as 100% white, and T9 as 100% black, then you can also define T2 as 80% white, 20% black etc etc. The you just issue a TX to switch to the colour mix ratio you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also used repetier host to set up these prints, it has nice abilities for splitting models into sub-parts, and assigning extruders to particular objects. You just set it up as a multicolour extrusion print and the virtual extruders take care of the rest. I forget whether we used the Cura or Slic3r engine within repetier, but it wraps those up pretty nicely so you don&amp;#39;t really end up dealing with them much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there on out it&amp;#39;s business as usual, take the GCode and print it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You&amp;#39;ll have what looks like a super tight pid loop with superb consistency. But you&amp;#39;ve lied to yourself, by constructing your control loop with the actual load not in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is particularly relevant when you have a fairly dynamic system like this where flow stops and starts often and varies significantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal controls theory aside, we&amp;#39;ve been using them for months.

It's just a fun challenge part to print. We aren't going to sell more big-boxes because people aren't going to rush to order a bigbox just so they can print the little bigbox specific test part. The object would serve no practical commercial purpose, we could just keep using a benchy as before. We just thought it would just be a kind of.... a neat thing, a fun challenge, I guess?\n\nThis isn't us getting commercial work done for free by exploiting other peoples free labour. This is just a cool test part, meant to be fun to design and print. If someone designs something cool enough that we do end up using it, we'll give them a free machine as thanks.\n\nThere are no hidden agendas here, no conspiracies to disguise 'unpaid labour'. This is intended to be a fun little design contest, and if it's 'labour' to you then don't partake.\n\nFrom the link you posted about speculative work:\nIs my contest spec work? \n\n&gt;Will I equitably pay a winning designer for the work rendered as if they were hired under contract to do the same thing?\n\n\nYes, more than, we'll be providing a complete 3D printer to the value of over $1000. Even if you spent 10 hours, which is way more than I would expect this would take, you're getting equivalent to $100/hr. Not shabby.\n\n&gt;Will I negotiate proper compensation for the usage rights commensurate to the designer’s level of skill?\n\n\nYes, as stated in the above there is pretty generous compensation on offer, and the fact that we expect to be able to freely use the design in exchange for the prize is made clear and upfront in the description of the competition. The winning design would just end up going on various 3D sharing sites with a free CC-BY-SA license anyway.\n\n&gt;Will I return the working files and usage rights to all submitted designs, especially if they don’t win?\n\n\nYes, we don't claim any rights over any work other than the winning work we choose, and every contestant submission remains entirely their own property.\n\nThis isn't corporate exploitation.

I even think the companies that selling their own PEI compounds are probably using SABIC Ultem as input resin and just doing a bit of their own blending/compounding, but I could be wrong.\n\nWe haven't done any in-depth testing with Ultem beyond some casual playing, but it seems that it should be possible to get some decent prints with it without a chamber providing you have a high performance heated bed and hotend, and the parts are small. I don't have a good solution for bed adhesion, and can only suggest using sacrificial PEI sheeting and prizing the parts off post-print. \n\nI've got a nice bit of Ultem 9085 in hand now, and will have a more formal and concerted crack at printing it and report back as soon as I can.",

I even think the companies that selling their own PEI compounds are probably using SABIC Ultem as input resin and just doing a bit of their own blending/compounding, but I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#39;t done any in-depth testing with Ultem beyond some casual playing, but it seems that it should be possible to get some decent prints with it without a chamber providing you have a high performance heated bed and hotend, and the parts are small. I don&amp;#39;t have a good solution for bed adhesion, and can only suggest using sacrificial PEI sheeting and prizing the parts off post-print. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a nice bit of Ultem 9085 in hand now, and will have a more formal and concerted crack at printing it and report back as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is why we created Volcano: &lt;a href=\"http://e3d-online.com/blog/volcano_release\"&gt;http://e3d-online.com/blog/volcano_release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should really have good numbers for the maximum top speed, but it&amp;#39;s around 50mm/s by my estimation. This is much faster than even a Volcano equipped hotend can keep up with, so the extruder will certainly extrude fast enough to out-perform the other parts of the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Don't struggle in silence, you paid for it - it should work without hassle, and we support whatever we sell.\n\nThe quickest thing to do would be to take a multimeter to the pins that connect to the ramps and see if there really is 0v, 5v and a signal voltage that varies with temperature on the appropriate connections. If there is, there's something wrong on the firmware/electrical connection side.

I've just been down and played with the one I have, the coating can be pretty easily scratched off, or burnt. It's probably a PTFE based mould coating of sorts, kind of a neat and cheap trick to get an \"all metal\" hotend to print more easily with sticky materials for a time, but that sort of coating degrades at high temperatures (over 250C or so), and wears off fairly easily with even slightly abrasive materials like carbon fibre, glow in the dark etc. It's also very possible that this approach is to be patent encumbered by a yet unpublished pending patent filed by someone who approached me with the idea a while back, as stupid as that patent may indeed be.\n\nThe heatbreak tube part isn't a single machined part as it might at first appear, it's multiple parts joined together in a fairly cunning manner. Go check it out under a microscope, you can see it really easily. The part as drawn in the PDF is basically impossible to machine, so you can't independently reproduce the part without additional undisclosed information about the multiple different manufacturing processes and sub-components that compose that part.\n\nMany people have been able to independently reproduce E3D hotends from our released drawings, the clones show it. But I don't see how it would be possible to reproduce a hexagon from the source released by lulzbot.\n\nI appreciate that philosophically our current license is less permissive, but in practical terms functional source for E3D hotends is available, but not for the hexagon.\n\nIn no way am I suggesting that lulzbot intentionally included undisclosed proprietary secret sauce, you guys have a solid and consistent open-source track record, and I think you were probably just unaware.

        "body": "Alright, /u/ppsieradzki1 stainless nozzles, it's a bit of a complex story here, so bear with...\n\nStainless nozzles were originally manufactured for a single specific customer who absolutely could not tolerate lead in their nozzles because of regulatory requirements for their application. \n\nThe thing is, once you have a machine loaded with a 4m long stainless bar, you may as well run the whole bar into nozzles instead of just making the 3 or so that the customer requested. So I did, and I put them on the site for sale in case anyone else had that need. That's how the stainless nozzle product was born, and we've been making them ever since.\n\nThen a few companies started testing out composite fibre (among other cool stuff) filled materials, which do cause erosion of the nozzle. Because of this they started using the stainless nozzles that were created for lead-free applications instead for their increased wear resistance.\n\nNow stainless is a great material and all, and significantly more wear resistant than brass, but it's by no means a super-duper wear resistant material that we designed for erosion resistance. But because they were available and they are better, companies that released filled materials started recommending SS nozzles to their customers.\n\nThe crux of the matter is that these nozzles are not designed for wear resistance, and if, (totally theoretically) a hotend company wanted to create a really awesome wear resistant nozzle they would probably wouldn't start with 303 stainless in the first place. They would probably create a nozzle from a very different material, with a different process, that would create a nozzle that is extremely wear resistant indeed, and could effectively be used indefinitely for even heavily filled abrasive materials. Probably.\n\nSS nozzles print ever so slightly slower as you are not able to get quite as much thermal flux through the nozzle to transfer heat from the block to the resin melt. Although the difference in conductivity between SS and brass is quite high (Brass being almost 10x better conductor), the difference in print speed is very small because the main limiting factor is the actual thermal conductivity of the plastic, which is very low.\n\n/u/3DRapidClone asks how much more resistant the stainless ones are compared to the brass. The answer is that I don't know yet. Sorry. What I do know is that they are quite a lot better, but I don't have numbers. I also know that XT-CF20 does indeed eat brass nozzles for breakfast. A mere 250g of CF20 tears up a brand new 0.40mm nozzle up to 0.52mm. A whole bunch of other damage also occurs, such as the nozzle bore being severely roughened, and the external tip flat being worn into a dome and not a neat flat planar circle (which is important as it affects the way the filament road is formed).\n\nLets have some nice pictures from my microscope to demonstrate:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/gLMcy (Much more description of wear characteristics in there too).\n\n\nOn the subject of the nozzles food safety, the nozzle is not in contact with food. I don't see how it makes much of a difference whether it is considered food safe, but almost all stainless grades can be used in food applications as long as they are used within their limits. This is a good article:http://www.bssa.org.uk/topics.php?article=45\n\nIt's worth bearing in mind that you are concerned about the liquid from your solo cup being toxic, which is printed with a nozzle. I don't see the food safety of the nozzle material is really a matter of importance. As we can see above, there is no appreciable wear with non-filled materials, so no appreciable transfer to the cup. And if something were to transfer to the cup, the cup would then have to transfer it to the liquid. The orders of magnitude of dilution here are nearly homeopathic! Think about your store bought solo cup, I can assure you that it wasn't blow moulded over a piece of food grade stainless, most likely a piece of nitrided tool steel, in a factory in China, which would not at all be considered a food safe material. The cup mould is analogous to the nozzle in this case. ",

Because of this they started using the stainless nozzles that were created for lead-free applications instead for their increased wear resistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now stainless is a great material and all, and significantly more wear resistant than brass, but it&amp;#39;s by no means a super-duper wear resistant material that we designed for erosion resistance. But because they were available and they are better, companies that released filled materials started recommending SS nozzles to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crux of the matter is that these nozzles are not designed for wear resistance, and if, (totally theoretically) a hotend company wanted to create a really awesome wear resistant nozzle they would probably wouldn&amp;#39;t start with 303 stainless in the first place. They would probably create a nozzle from a very different material, with a different process, that would create a nozzle that is extremely wear resistant indeed, and could effectively be used indefinitely for even heavily filled abrasive materials. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SS nozzles print ever so slightly slower as you are not able to get quite as much thermal flux through the nozzle to transfer heat from the block to the resin melt. Although the difference in conductivity between SS and brass is quite high (Brass being almost 10x better conductor), the difference in print speed is very small because the main limiting factor is the actual thermal conductivity of the plastic, which is very low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/3DRapidClone\"&gt;/u/3DRapidClone&lt;/a&gt; asks how much more resistant the stainless ones are compared to the brass. The answer is that I don&amp;#39;t know yet. Sorry. What I do know is that they are quite a lot better, but I don&amp;#39;t have numbers. I also know that XT-CF20 does indeed eat brass nozzles for breakfast. A mere 250g of CF20 tears up a brand new 0.40mm nozzle up to 0.52mm. A whole bunch of other damage also occurs, such as the nozzle bore being severely roughened, and the external tip flat being worn into a dome and not a neat flat planar circle (which is important as it affects the way the filament road is formed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets have some nice pictures from my microscope to demonstrate:\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/gLMcy\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/gLMcy&lt;/a&gt; (Much more description of wear characteristics in there too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the subject of the nozzles food safety, the nozzle is not in contact with food. I don&amp;#39;t see how it makes much of a difference whether it is considered food safe, but almost all stainless grades can be used in food applications as long as they are used within their limits. This is a good article:&lt;a href=\"http://www.bssa.org.uk/topics.php?article=45\"&gt;http://www.bssa.org.uk/topics.php?article=45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth bearing in mind that you are concerned about the liquid from your solo cup being toxic, which is printed with a nozzle. I don&amp;#39;t see the food safety of the nozzle material is really a matter of importance. As we can see above, there is no appreciable wear with non-filled materials, so no appreciable transfer to the cup. And if something were to transfer to the cup, the cup would then have to transfer it to the liquid. The orders of magnitude of dilution here are nearly homeopathic! Think about your store bought solo cup, I can assure you that it wasn&amp;#39;t blow moulded over a piece of food grade stainless, most likely a piece of nitrided tool steel, in a factory in China, which would not at all be considered a food safe material. The cup mould is analogous to the nozzle in this case. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "I've printed pretty much every weird filament out there that you can buy, including most brand variants etc, not all, but most. As well as some stuff that never got released, or is yet to be released.\n\nEverything from proto-pasta, taulman, colorfabb, ninjaflex. Most resin grades of ABS, a few different PC-ABS blends. A whole pile of PET/Co-polyesters. All of those peculiar wood fibre/stone powder/metal powder decorative composites. A few different carbon/glass/aramid fibre filled materials. Almost every commercially available Nylon, including PA12. PLAs, too many to count, but includes some more interesting pigments and strange properties such as high-impact variants and flexible variants. Pretty much every flexible filament you can buy. Every high-end engineering plastic I can get my hands on, including POM, Ultem, Polycarbonate, and Tritan.\n\n**Ones I keep coming back to:**\n\n* 1 - PC-ABS, just so awesome. Amazing overhangs, support material removal, dimensional accuracy, STRONG, glossy, stiff. Harder to print than ABS, but not nearly the hair pulling nightmare fuel of PC. Proto-Pasta rule the roost here. I have some of my own custom blend PC-ABS that I'm going to release for substantially lower cost, but I'll readily admit that if I'm going for a no compromises print I'm going to crack out the protopasta. I have over 1000kg of filament in various materials at my disposal, this is the only one I specifically order on the types of spools and in colours that I want, for my own use. Dustin and Alex at protopasta have this one nailed.\n\n* 2 - NinjaFlex, too much fun, actually quite practical for a surprising number of things, easy to print once you get the hang of it.\n\n* 3 - Sabic Cycolac MG94 ABS. If you're going to print ABS, print this stuff. You'll understand when you start printing it.\n\n* 4 - Taulman Bridge. Tough as nails. Versatile. Not a pain in the ass to print like its other polyamide friends.\n\n* 5 - PLA, I like our own brand \"E3D Everyday\" stuff, but I'm biased! Sometimes you just need to smash something out, have it look great, and not worry about a fingerprint on your build platform, or draft exclusion, or filament cost. It's a lot stiffer and stronger than people give it credit for too.\n\nThings that I don't think many people (if any) have done:\nFEP - A teflon variant, prints quite nicely if a little warpy, but you need some serious temperature. 420C on the hotend, 220C on the bed. Also kills you if you inhale, not for the feint of heart.\n\nUltem, prints quite nicely, but sucks so much moisture out of the air it makes Nylon look like a cakewalk. Also couldn't get this to print onto any surface other than sacrificial ultem. Which is a pain.\n\nSome exciting Nylons, and Nylon blends. Nylon 12 is kind of cool, and very very different to the Taulman Nylons which are Nylon 6/* blends. Nylon 12 is much more rigid and stiff, but harder to print. More on this soon.\n\nAlso I now have some PEEK. Just waiting for some PEEK sheet for print surface, and I'll get onto printing it. It's a resin grade we chose to try and be vaguely printable, and I'm reasonably hopeful we can get some decent prints from it. Just the filament alone is mechanically impressive.",

Very interesting.\n\nJust to clear some things up, this is not Z Wobble, nor is it an issue with filament diameter or consistency. Nor is it anything to do with your hotend, extrusion or temperatures.\n\nThe pattern on your print corresponds seemingly exactly with the position of the STL vertices that you can see in the file here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:441087\n\nMy first inclination is that this is mechanical lash in your X and or Y axes. As your printer approaches the corner of a vertex it must change direction suddenly. If your machine has some lash in the belts or bearings, or the frame some flex then the machine will deviate from it's commanded XY position at that corner and produce the artifacts you see on your print.\n\nThis can be solved by either going over the mechanics of your machine to ensure rigidity and lack of slop. Additionally you can check your acceleration settings, as well as jerk. Turning this down may have a positive effect on your prints. Additionally simply reducing print speed may be helpful.\n\nPrint something more geometrically simple, with corners. Such as hexagon or circle. Look for lash at the corners and tune it out, either mechanically or in software.",

Nor is it anything to do with your hotend, extrusion or temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pattern on your print corresponds seemingly exactly with the position of the STL vertices that you can see in the file here: &lt;a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:441087\"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:441087&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first inclination is that this is mechanical lash in your X and or Y axes. As your printer approaches the corner of a vertex it must change direction suddenly. If your machine has some lash in the belts or bearings, or the frame some flex then the machine will deviate from it&amp;#39;s commanded XY position at that corner and produce the artifacts you see on your print.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can be solved by either going over the mechanics of your machine to ensure rigidity and lack of slop. Additionally you can check your acceleration settings, as well as jerk. Turning this down may have a positive effect on your prints. Additionally simply reducing print speed may be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Print something more geometrically simple, with corners. Such as hexagon or circle. Look for lash at the corners and tune it out, either mechanically or in software.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I liked your article and have used methods nearly identical to what you describe myself. \n\nI would just like to point out that extrudate curling as it exits the nozzle is not definitively indicative of a jam. Curling is fairly natural and can ocurr in lots of non-blockage situations, and can be safely ignored in most cases. What is shown in your image would not concern me at all. However, if you are getting abnormally thin extrudate that is very curly this could be due a partial blockage. \n\nMy first port of call would always be to use the warm pull technique described in this excellent guide. http://bukobot.com/nozzle-cleaning \nIt is similar to what you describe second, and has nearly no risk of damaging the hotend. \n\nFinally, prevention is better than cure. Crap in your hotend either comes from crap in the filament or crap on the filament.  Don't buy crap filament, look for reviews. You can't tell just by looking at it whether it has a small metal shaving 3/4 the way into the spool. Keep your filament clean, use a sponge dust wiper as it enters the extruder. When you start using one and look at the sponge after a days printing you'll understand why! ",

I don't know what kind of trouble you've been having from your post, but I'm sure we can get you up and running.\n\nRegarding galvanic corrosion - is *incredibly unlikely* to be galvanic corrosion. Galvanic corrosion follows a very predictable course of action whereby one metal corrodes and the other is protected. The metal that corrodes is the more reactive one and the metal that is protected is the less reactive one (broadly speaking - there are special tables for exact order they take). Being that Brass is extremely cathodic and aluminium is extremely anodic I don't see how the brass can be being galvanically corroded when in the presence of aluminium. (Caveat: I don't know how Stainless steel factors into this in  a three metal situation.) Lastly, you need an electrolyte to be present for galvanic corrosion to take place, if your printer is anywhere reasonably dry this shouldn't be probable. (Especially with it getting hot here and there.) Brass also tends to corrode green from the copper sulphate formed in corrosion.\n\nI don't know what to propose as an alternative solution to what you're seeing here, as it certainly doesn't look normal or correct. When I take threads apart I often see a certain amount of burnt plastic residue present, but it doesn't look much like this at all. Was there any sort of sealant or thermal paste applied to the threads? Either way I'm happy to replace the part and help ensure you get setup with a fully working setup that performs as you should expect from your E3D hotend.",

Necessary because extruders move, and weight is an issue in this case. E3D have done plenty thermal simulations on the kraken, however they are very boring to look at. You have a big blue block and four red nozzles sticking out the bottom. No pretty rainbows. That's how it's designed to be.\n\nThe picture on the pico page is pretty and all, but I have serious doubts regarding their methodology. In fact I would say that their use of those simulations is more hype than engineering.",

It is entirely because water cooling allows more cooling in less space (weight). Necessary because extruders move, and weight is an issue in this case. E3D have done plenty thermal simulations on the kraken, however they are very boring to look at. You have a big blue block and four red nozzles sticking out the bottom. No pretty rainbows. That&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s designed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The picture on the pico page is pretty and all, but I have serious doubts regarding their methodology. In fact I would say that their use of those simulations is more hype than engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Then the heater block - that is just a chunk of aluminium.

The decision to go water cooled isn't about being able to ditch lots of heat (although that's nice and all) it's about being able to function in heated chambers/enclosures where air cooling can't. It's also a massive space saver.\n\nThe water channel is 6.75mm in diameter, and around 30 - 40mm in length, depending where you count it as starting and finishing.\n\nWe've tested this at 300C on all four nozzles at once, 13w really is nothing to get rid of whether by air or water. We have an absolutely absurd surplus of cooling capacity when using water cooling. If I turn off the cooling system, set the nozzles all to 300C, let the heatsink warm up to the point where I can no longer hold it, then turn on the coolant pump the heatsink will cool to water temperature in around 2 seconds. We aren't even using a radiator, just an aluminium camping water bottle with the top cut off at this stage as combined reservoir and radiator.\n\nI am very aware of the issues makerbot had - a lot of that can be put down to the fact that they went and slapped a lid/enclosure around their air cooled hotend, which sits (always) at the top of the box in their design where heat collects and is in direct thermal contact with a nice warm stepper motor. I'm not in the slightest concerned about our smooth heat breaks making enough thermal contact. I know the tolerances our parts come out at, and the hole and the break mate very very well. On top of that we intend on shipping these out with a little thermal grease sachet. (even though we are testing without the stuff on the prototypes)\n\nWe are printing/moving forward sporadically with it, but there are software holdups we are preoccupied with presently. The main holdup is that people keep ordering more and more of the V5 hotend, and shipping everything is eating up time! We haven't gone through with multi-nozzle printing yet, but all nozzles are verified as functional individually (with other nozzles idling at 300C).\n\nWe've got plenty of kinks to iron out at this stage, and a good few optimisations left, but the the thermodynamics is absolutely not something I am concerned about.",

If the Gain is 100 and you feed in 1milliVolt, you get 100mV out.

(These are called variable gain amplifiers, but just think of it like the transistor example above)\n\nSay, for example, if the Gain pin is at 100mV then the gain will be 100, if 50mV then gain = 50 and so on.\n\nIf we then put the output of one of our DACs onto the Gain pin, and another onto the Gate pin, then what comes out is the multiplication of those two values.\n\nSo if we put in 10mV and 20mV we would get 200mV out (note that 10*20=200).\n\nWe then take that 200mV and feed it into a thing called an Analog to Digital Converter or ADC (Just like a DAC but backwards) and you would get 200 back out, in digital. YAY MULTIPLICATION (This is however analog electronics and you would likely not get exact results back, but hey, its sloppy maths!).\n\nNotice we have used only a DAC a Variable Amplifier and an ADC to do all this. (In reality all these bits are made of sub bits themselves etc, but the net result is that you use FAR fewer parts due to the fact that the number of \"parts\" needed to make a digital (precise) multiplier rises as a square factor of the number of bits of precision you want it to calculate to, whereas DACs and ADCs scale linearly, and amplifiers are constant amount of parts whatever the precision.) \n\nThis is a **GROSS** simplification of matters and only covers an example of how you **MIGHT** perform one kind of operations (Multiplication) and is just how I **THINK** they are most probably going about this.",

(Thats 8 shots in the ~1MOA ring and 2 shots escaping out of that ring but still staying within the ~2MOA circle, a total of 10 scoring shots) I was having a good day, but it was no fluke and I shoot like this reasonably often that I wouldn't call it rare for me. By no means am I considered an amazing shot. This British open (shot by people from all over the world, think of it like what wimbledon is to tennis) I came 101st in the main (Queens prize) competition. There are many people better than me, I'm just in the GB under 25's and not in the A-team even. I can name many people who can quite reliably shoot  like that constantly. Again, all without telescopic sights, and not just punching holes at 100yds, 900 and 1000 are standard UK TR distances.",

(Thats 8 shots in the ~1MOA ring and 2 shots escaping out of that ring but still staying within the ~2MOA circle, a total of 10 scoring shots) I was having a good day, but it was no fluke and I shoot like this reasonably often that I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it rare for me. By no means am I considered an amazing shot. This British open (shot by people from all over the world, think of it like what wimbledon is to tennis) I came 101st in the main (Queens prize) competition. There are many people better than me, I&amp;#39;m just in the GB under 25&amp;#39;s and not in the A-team even. I can name many people who can quite reliably shoot  like that constantly. Again, all without telescopic sights, and not just punching holes at 100yds, 900 and 1000 are standard UK TR distances.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Both Civilian target shooters who i know personally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These kind of people need to be split off into a separate agency to manage FAC applications and processing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Such that the default situation is that you cannot purchase a firearm, you apply for a certificate and if granted you can then acquire firearms.\n\nHowever, the current system is utter shite, it is administered by the police forces by often clueless \"firearms liaison officers\". An example of the cluelessness; I own a piece of land, full of deer. This land is a deep steep sided curved valley, a bullet could not escape unless you deliberately TRIED to get one out of there, I was told by the lady that \"I didnt have any backstops, and there were too many trees\" TOO MANY TREES? THE FUCK IS THAT? Furthermore, I was applying for a .270Win for shooting Red and Roe deer, same clueless lady informed me that .270  was not powerful enough for Red deer, only for Roe. Confused, I asked her what calibre she thought more suitable, \".308 would be powerful enough, but not .270\". I tried to explain to her that .270 was rather more powerful than .308 and more capable a deer round but she insisted otherwise. I explained that .270 was designed for large north American dangerous game like bear, she brushed this off by saying \"But we don't have bear in the UK\". My application was refused.\n\nFirearms certification should be managed by a separate non-partisan authority. The police dislike issuing certificates because each one means more work for them, as well as a general feeling that the public should not be trusted with guns. A separate authority would eliminate this as well as leaving the police to... y'know do some policing.\n\nThe current system of applying for a specific calibre is stupid, time consuming and places a great burden on buyers, sellers, and police time. Instead there should be a a few \"bands\" that cover a range of cartridges. Rimfire(22lr, 17hmr, 22wmr etc), Small Centerfire(.22 hornet, to .22-250), Medium Centerfire (.243 up to something like .300RUM) and then a Large Centerfire for everything else upwards.\n\nLand approval should remain (Someone comes around, looks at the land intended to be shot over and deems it suitable for the appropriate calibre bands above), In practice this already happens, land is approved in categories of calibres by the police, but the applicant must apply for a specific calibre, the categories/bands should instead be carried down to the applicants. The current system whereby a shooter who has shot for 5 Years without incident is granted dispensation to use firearms over whatever land he deems appropriate should remain.\n\nDitch the stupid pistol ban, does nothing, did nothing, only hurts law abiding citizens. Issue them for target shooting and humane dispatch where appropriate.\n\nKeep the mandatory club membership as a prerequisite for owning target firearms. But again, ditch stupid calibre specific crap. I have seen people who have \"Acquire 200 Rounds, .308Win\" refused 7.62mm ammo because of this shit.\n\nAbove are my thoughts, I'd love to hear other people opinions on the matter.",

I am proposing the following based on wikipedia, reading, and things that make sense to my own mind. Caveat Lector.\n\nYou state:\n\n&gt; The human eye is not optically sensitive to xrays or gamma rays. \n\nBut what of this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Ray#Visibility_to_the_human_eye\nCould this go a long way to explaining the effects described above (not just by this redditors grandad, but by massive numbers of nuke witnesses)\n\nAdditionally, if x-rays have some element of visibility to the human eye, why not gamma rays? Is there research one way or the other? Bear in mind that the levels of radiation the eye would be exposed may be vastly higher than that of more common settings.\n\nYour second point:\n&gt; Nuclear explosions produce nuclides and gamma rays - not xrays. \n\nThis is *i think* wrong. The entire principle of the Teller-Ulam nuclear weapon design relies heavily on the emmission of x-rays by the primary triggering core. Perhaps the emission of x-rays is negligible compared to that of gamma rays though?\n\nIn that case, although comparatively negligible to gamma, the amount of x-ray radiation may still be very significant, these are nukes we are talking about after all right?\n\nIt may also be possible that the bones (or elements contained in the bones, calcium for example) when excited by the massive gamma radiation may fluoresce x-rays which would then (maybe, see wiki link above) be visible.\n\nThese two points, while true for medical imaging are not relevantly applicable here.\n\n&gt; In order to see clear boundaries of tissue structure (i.e bone outlines) the source of radiation MUST be a 'point' \n\nand \n\n&gt; Radiation must pass through the object being imaged TOWARDS the receiver\n\nYes, you need a point source in medical imaging to provide sharp images, and it must pass through the object toward the film/plate to project that image successfully. This is not quite how human vision works though. \n\nImagine for a moment I have painted a skeleton with glow-in-the-dark paint and placed it into a completely dark room. If I were to look at the skeleton I would see it just fine glowing away, this is because of the way the pupil acts as a point source which is then projected onto the retina.\n\nI do not know enough on the subject to talk about your point five, but just because an event is very energetic (Nuclear explosion) does not mean it only produces high energy rays, we can see from the massive flash of orangered light that a nuclear blast must produce a massive range of energy levels in its output radiation, quite possibly including the correct energy level x-rays for reflecting off bone and thus producing images apparent to the viewer.\n\nThis is not meant to be some debunking of your comment drharvey, just some points to consider, you definitely seem to know what you are talking about with reference to medical imaging. It just seems there might be other things you have passed over or work differently in this context. If you can find problems in my statements please point them out!\n",
