That&amp;#39;s according to this &lt;a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/pandemic-literature-review-26643/\"&gt;Zillow study&lt;/a&gt;. Prices could also be buoyed by the fact that inventory was historically low, and mortgage rates were also low, prior to the virus. That said, the novel coronavirus is unprecedented, and could have unprecedented consequences history can&amp;#39;t teach us about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of existing homeowners... the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s massive emergency rate cuts actually created a situation where they were able to refinance mortgages at more attractive rates. They are the presumed winners in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, it seems like there are more checks and balances in place to fend off a full-blown housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- JC&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The coronavirus epidemic has been sending people fleeing to the safety of gold, a traditional safe haven asset, and silver hasn't gotten the same boost. To trace that dynamic, consider another stat: silver is down 16% this year, while gold is up 9%.\n\nSo what's an investor to do? Market technicians are surely licking their chops, eagerly awaiting a snapback in that ratio, which would mean gains for silver vs. gold. But when will that actually happen, if risk aversion is still so pronounced? The timing for that trade will likely trace any economic recovery. Since silver is much less of a luxury metal than gold, and used more for its conductive properties in machinery, any recovery will likely mirror an rebound in economic activity.\n\n\\- JC",

I'll tackle them in order:\n\n* In terms of how \"informed\" market moves are, it depends on whether you're looking at the index or single-stock level. Given how much institutional ownership there is among the major ETFs tracking indexes (SPY, QQQ), they're more insulated from the day-trader crowd. You're seeing noise there, but nothing that's going to turn the tide of the market. Single stocks are another animal entirely. If you're looking at outsized moves in \"trendy\" stocks like Zoom, Peloton, or even Tesla, those are much more likely to move at the whim of the \"uninformed\" (aka retail) crowd.\n* In terms of COVID-19 data, I'd direct you to our [live blog](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news) covering various forecasts and statistics around the virus. I'm not as familiar with the curve as the capable folks manning that page are.\n* For oil, I think your hunch that Russia's reasoning goes beyond technical reasons is spot-on. From what I've gathered (this [Oil.com post](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/The-Inevitable-Outcome-Of-The-Oil-Price-War.html) is a great read), Russia's budget breakeven point of $40/barrel is less than half of Saudi Arabia's. In other words, they can absorb a lot more oil-price pain than the Saudis. Their reluctance to play ball with OPEC+ could be viewed as their way of weakening competitors and showing how much leverage they have in a full-out oil price war.\n\n\\- JC",

Markets Insider actually detailed Icahn&amp;#39;s full bet against commercial mortgage-backed securities &lt;a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/carl-icahn-could-win-400-million-short-bet-mall-debt-2019-11-1028704886\"&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Icahn&amp;#39;s trade involves credit-default swaps tied to the mortgage-based CMBX 6 index. Should malls included in the index default on their debt, Icahn could see his investment&amp;#39;s value skyrocket. He could reportedly make up to $400 million if shopping center owners default on their loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- JC&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I'll tackle them in order:\n\n* In terms of how \"informed\" market moves are, it depends on whether you're looking at the index or single-stock level. Given how much institutional ownership there is among the major ETFs tracking indexes (SPY, QQQ), they're more insulated from the day-trader crowd. You're seeing noise there, but nothing that's going to turn the tide of the market. Single stocks are another animal entirely. If you're looking at outsized moves in \"trendy\" stocks like Zoom, Peloton, or even Tesla, those are much more likely to move at the whim of the \"uninformed\" (aka retail) crowd.\n* In terms of COVID-19 data, I'd direct you to our [live blog](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news) covering various forecasts and statistics around the virus. I'm not as familiar with the curve as the capable folks manning that page are.\n* For oil, I think your hunch that Russia's reasoning goes beyond technical reasons is spot-on. From what I've gathered (this [Oil.com post](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/The-Inevitable-Outcome-Of-The-Oil-Price-War.html) is a great read), Russia's budget breakeven point of $40/barrel is less than half of Saudi Arabia's. In other words, they can absorb a lot more oil-price pain than the Saudis. Their reluctance to play ball with OPEC+ could be viewed as their way of weakening competitors and showing how much leverage they have in a full-out oil price war.\n\n\\- JC",

Former counterintelligence officials told me it was natural for the FBI to look at the NRA as a potential vessel of Russian influence during the election, and Torshin would, of course, have popped up as part of that thread. In recent months, we've learned that Torshin and his associate attempted to set up various meetings, through NRA and religious-rights representatives, with members of the Trump campaign. We've learned that Cleta Mitchell, an NRA lawyer, reportedly expressed concerns about the NRA's Russia ties. The NRA disclosed in April that it received contributions from 23 Russians or Americans living in Russia. Last month, a top Spanish prosecutor revealed that Spanish authorities have turned over wiretaps featuring Torshin to the FBI. Yahoo News' Michael Isikoff also reported that Torshin was invited, through his NRA ties, to a prayer breakfast with the newly inaugurated President Trump in early 2017 (his invitation was ultimately rescinded after administration officials learned of his murky dealings). And NPR reported this year that Torshin sent multiple tweets indicating that he was familiar with Trump before the election. As I mentioned in my response to another similar question about NRA/Russia ties, it's very unlikely that this is the last we'll hear of links between the two entities.",
