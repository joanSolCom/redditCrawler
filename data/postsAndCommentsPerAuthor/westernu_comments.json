But, from what I can tell, his claim that he can predict divorce with 94% accuracy comes from this study of 52 couples, published in 1992:  [https://search-proquest-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/docview/614305792?accountid=15115](https://search-proquest-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/docview/614305792?accountid=15115)   \n\n\n13.5% of the sample had divorced over a three-year period, or 7 couples. After the data were already in hand, the researchers used a discriminant function analysis with nine predictors to predict which couples divorced, with 93.6% accuracy.   \n\n\nThis model suffers from a statistical problem called overfitting. With a small sample size, and a technique that doesn't use any kind of cross-validation, you can essentially keep adding predictors until you explain close to 100% of the variance. We call that a saturated model. Almost all the variance has technically been \"explained\", but only for the very specific sample that the model was built on. If I went and recruited 52 new couples, and applied this exact same model to those data, the accuracy would likely be much less - likely closer to 86.5% (which is the baseline here - you get 86.5% accuracy if you simply predict that no one gets divorced).   \n\n\nTldr Although I have lots of respect for Gottman, I am incredibly dubious of that 94% claim.",

After the data were already in hand, the researchers used a discriminant function analysis with nine predictors to predict which couples divorced, with 93.6% accuracy.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This model suffers from a statistical problem called overfitting. With a small sample size, and a technique that doesn&amp;#39;t use any kind of cross-validation, you can essentially keep adding predictors until you explain close to 100% of the variance. We call that a saturated model. Almost all the variance has technically been &amp;quot;explained&amp;quot;, but only for the very specific sample that the model was built on. If I went and recruited 52 new couples, and applied this exact same model to those data, the accuracy would likely be much less - likely closer to 86.5% (which is the baseline here - you get 86.5% accuracy if you simply predict that no one gets divorced).   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr Although I have lots of respect for Gottman, I am incredibly dubious of that 94% claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For example, you'll notice that gender is not on the list. There are hundreds of studies on the importance of gender in relationships, and it was measured in every study we had.

But, I think I would push back on the idea that this is something that needs to be controlled for or somehow subtracted from the ratings. When we’re talking about relationship quality, really, perception is reality. You’re happy if you think you’re happy! It’s an inherently subjective construct.\n\nI think that’s why own traits did such a better job of predicting relationship quality than the partner’s traits, in these analyses. Your own proneness to things like positive and negative affect are going to shape how you perceive your partner and the relationship, and therefore how satisfied you are with that relationship.

But, I think I would push back on the idea that this is something that needs to be controlled for or somehow subtracted from the ratings. When we’re talking about relationship quality, really, perception is reality. You’re happy if you think you’re happy! It’s an inherently subjective construct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that’s why own traits did such a better job of predicting relationship quality than the partner’s traits, in these analyses. Your own proneness to things like positive and negative affect are going to shape how you perceive your partner and the relationship, and therefore how satisfied you are with that relationship. To a large extent, we project our own personalities, feelings, biases, etc. onto our partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That’s not to say they are necessarily related, but a lot of the work that I, and others, have done in the past trying to understand what happens in the brain when we experience memory loss, comes by studying the brains and behaviour of people with Alzheimer’s. That in turn can give us some clues about what might be going wrong in other conditions were similar deficits are observed (in COVID-19, perhaps). So, by studying different conditions and different patterns of cognitive deficit we are able to put all the pieces together and answer the $66 million question - how does the brain work?\n\nThe first part of your question is also interesting. Do the cognitive deficits that follow COVID-19 mimic those we see in Alzheimers. This we do not yet know but it is one of the main aims of our study. Do they get worse (like Alzheimer’s), do they remain stable or so they get better over time. Tune in a year from now and we’ll know the answer!",

That’s not to say they are necessarily related, but a lot of the work that I, and others, have done in the past trying to understand what happens in the brain when we experience memory loss, comes by studying the brains and behaviour of people with Alzheimer’s. That in turn can give us some clues about what might be going wrong in other conditions were similar deficits are observed (in COVID-19, perhaps). So, by studying different conditions and different patterns of cognitive deficit we are able to put all the pieces together and answer the $66 million question - how does the brain work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first part of your question is also interesting. Do the cognitive deficits that follow COVID-19 mimic those we see in Alzheimers. This we do not yet know but it is one of the main aims of our study. Do they get worse (like Alzheimer’s), do they remain stable or so they get better over time. Tune in a year from now and we’ll know the answer!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Many people are struggling with working longer hours, checking email more often, and letting work spill too much into one’s own time.  This can be particularly tricky for researchers because the work lacks clear endpoints.  Structure may be much more needed these days because of the lack of external structure of heading into work and returning home.  \n\nThese tips may help you.  When you first sit down to work, take a few minutes to make some commitments for yourself and write them down. Why write them down?  Because you are more likely to stick to them.  First, what time would you like your work day to end today?  Write down the time, say, 5:30.  Set your phone alarm for 5:20 pm.  That will give you 10 minutes to save your work, send that final email, and log off your computer.  Second, write down what you hope to accomplish during the work day.   That will help you stay focused.  \n\nYou may also find it helpful to have a “buddy”, someone with whom you text daily.  You might send each other what you hope to get done and what you do accomplish.  This is not to judge each other, but rather cheer each other on.

I agree that relationships are incredibly nebulous and subjective, which is part of why they are so fascinating to me! I think they’re a central part of many people’s lives, so it’s worth pulling out all the methodological stops to try to understand them, empirically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take a multi-method approach to studying relationships. In other projects I&amp;#39;ve used videotaped interactions between couples, daily experience studies where we send brief surveys to couples about their relationships each day, longitudinal methods where we track relationships over months or years, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Now, machine learning is pretty black boxy, so we can’t tell you exactly what age is doing in these models. But it’s quite possible that it’s a moderator of a lot of the other variables—that different variables are important for relationship quality depending on your age.\n\nWe did not try to predict divorce or breakups in these models.

Just to take an example (and I am not saying that this is going to be the case - this is a simplification), what if we find that those people who are  suffering from the worst long term brain effects have all been treated with the same sedative while they were on a ventilator? Then it might be possible to switch to other types of sedatives that do not produce the same “side effects”. Think about what happened with the steroid dexamethasone a few weeks ago. As soon as it was established that it was helpful for some people with very severe COVID-19 symptoms, hospitals all around the world started using it. Everything changed overnight. Similarly, if we can track down what is causing these cognitive deficits then we have the first clue that we need to work out how to deal with them.

Just to take an example (and I am not saying that this is going to be the case - this is a simplification), what if we find that those people who are  suffering from the worst long term brain effects have all been treated with the same sedative while they were on a ventilator? Then it might be possible to switch to other types of sedatives that do not produce the same “side effects”. Think about what happened with the steroid dexamethasone a few weeks ago. As soon as it was established that it was helpful for some people with very severe COVID-19 symptoms, hospitals all around the world started using it. Everything changed overnight. Similarly, if we can track down what is causing these cognitive deficits then we have the first clue that we need to work out how to deal with them. I’m sorry but sometimes science moves more slowly than we would like it to, but we always make progress!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

These could be caused by many aspects of COVID-19 infection, including direct viral effects in the brain, indirect viral injuries due to inflammation, blood clots or problems in the blood vessels, as well as problems caused by low oxygen levels, medications, immobilization and sensory/social deprivation. We want to try to find out by comparing the experiences of many thousands of people worldwide and assessing (and comparing) these cognitive difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It is a site that offers a multitude of on-line courses in just about anything you can think of from a variety of educational institutions around the world. You can take these courses for free! You can also pay a fee and obtain certification, but if your interest is just in learning, then free is a great deal. \n\nThis is a great time of year for gardening. Whether you are just starting a garden, or whether you take this opportunity to clean up an established garden, it’s very rewarding work. \n\nHave you ever thought you’d like to take up some kind of hobby, but didn’t have time for it? Knitting, painting, carpentry, or something completely different? \n\nAny interest in learning a new language?

It is a site that offers a multitude of on-line courses in just about anything you can think of from a variety of educational institutions around the world. You can take these courses for free! You can also pay a fee and obtain certification, but if your interest is just in learning, then free is a great deal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a great time of year for gardening. Whether you are just starting a garden, or whether you take this opportunity to clean up an established garden, it’s very rewarding work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought you’d like to take up some kind of hobby, but didn’t have time for it? Knitting, painting, carpentry, or something completely different? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any interest in learning a new language?

Many people are struggling with working longer hours, checking email more often, and letting work spill too much into one’s own time.  This can be particularly tricky for researchers because the work lacks clear endpoints.  Structure may be much more needed these days because of the lack of external structure of heading into work and returning home.  \n\nThese tips may help you.  When you first sit down to work, take a few minutes to make some commitments for yourself and write them down. Why write them down?  Because you are more likely to stick to them.  First, what time would you like your work day to end today?  Write down the time, say, 5:30.  Set your phone alarm for 5:20 pm.  That will give you 10 minutes to save your work, send that final email, and log off your computer.  Second, write down what you hope to accomplish during the work day.   That will help you stay focused.  \n\nYou may also find it helpful to have a “buddy”, someone with whom you text daily.  You might send each other what you hope to get done and what you do accomplish.  This is not to judge each other, but rather cheer each other on.  Your colleagues are likely facing the same problems so you actually help them as you help yourself.",

When you first sit down to work, take a few minutes to make some commitments for yourself and write them down. Why write them down?  Because you are more likely to stick to them.  First, what time would you like your work day to end today?  Write down the time, say, 5:30.  Set your phone alarm for 5:20 pm.  That will give you 10 minutes to save your work, send that final email, and log off your computer.  Second, write down what you hope to accomplish during the work day.   That will help you stay focused.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may also find it helpful to have a “buddy”, someone with whom you text daily.  You might send each other what you hope to get done and what you do accomplish.  This is not to judge each other, but rather cheer each other on.  Your colleagues are likely facing the same problems so you actually help them as you help yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There is so much uncertainty right now about what the world will look like when we emerge from Covid-19 that it’s impossible to offer concrete assurances. One thought that has come to my mind is that we will be ‘in this together’ in the aftermath of Covid as much as we are during the current crisis. That means that many, many of us will be struggling with seeing our plans disrupted and having to figure out new paths forward. In my experience, it is easier to face big challenges when we are not alone with them. So any way you have of connecting with others who are in your situation and sharing feelings, hopes and fears might be helpful. Without having any idea what the future will actually look like, I can say with certainty that opportunities as well as challenges will emerge from this situation. Being young gives you flexibility and skill sets that will help you to recognize and take up opportunities to pursue new directions. Be open to them. Watch for them.",
