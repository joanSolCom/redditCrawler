        "body": "Hey Bromley,\n\nI have a strong theory, after a decade of teaching creatives in the financial space, and being one myself. I believe there is a strong cultural assumption that people who choose to be professional creatives or artists are *by default* terrible with finance. Like many other stereotypes, they can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In my case, I received so many messages growing up that pursuing theater meant I'd be broke and struggle my whole life. Eventually, I just took it for granted, like gravity or paying taxes -- just a law of the universe. \n\nI believe that a large number of creatives are poor with finances because they were a) taught that it's natural and  so b) were never taught the fundamentals. Over the years, we've seen hundreds of artists (including ourselves) experience a true empowerment and awakening by learning skills like budgeting, harnessing compound interest, and planning their financial future. It can be done.\n\nThe last thing I'll note is this -- in some cases, like yours, creatives (and non-creatives) just don't enjoy the nuts and bolts of managing finances themselves. Not that they CAN'T, but it's just tedious. I get that. I find auto-work tedious and exhausting, while many men love it, and do it for fun. There are even aspects of finance I find tedious myself -- I outsource tax and book keeping to others who like to do it more than me, while I enjoy managing the budget, investments, and cashflow. So I would suggest that loving (or hating) the nuts and bolts of different financial processes has more to do with your personality and what you find fun, than being a creative or not.\n\nIf I were to give any advice, I would suggest you to try to educate yourself and improve in the areas of finance you don't mind, and outsource the rest. You don't need to keep your own books -- find a book keeper who specializes in working artists! I find running a business budget to be empowering and even slightly fun -- but if you don't, partner with or hire somebody who does! Better to have a copilot than be flying blind (or doing it yourself and hating it)!\n\nHope that helps, and thanks for the question!\n\n- Philip",

That's not an irrelevant amount of money!\n\nIn our experience, the value of hiring a CPA comes once you're making at at least $10k - $20k of self-employed income. At that point, even one minor adjustment or efficiency can save you the full cost of their fee. E.g. when to elect S-Corp status, writing off travel, or part of your home as a home-office, or designing your route to work in a manner that maximizes deductible mileage. Personally, we started using a CPA a couple years into being self-employed (Julia as a home-organizer, and me as a theater teacher) back in our early 20's.

It's something we've been trying to get better at teaching for 6+ years, and we're still learning every day.\n\nBiggest thing -- the student must have a deep inner-drive to make it work. If there's a way to drag a person to budgeting and make it stick, we've certainly never seen it. There must be an excitement, a hope, and a willingness to suck at it for a while. Without that ingredient, nothing else matters.\n\nOther useful pieces that have assisted folks (assuming they have the excitedment and energy to really create a budget that works): Get a tool that instills good habits and best practices (we love YNAB for its envelope methodology, and \"every dollar gets a job\" design); do it with accountability -- our married clients have much more success than single ones; plan for it to feel like you're bad at budgeting for 3 months, and don't expect to really feel a major difference until 6 months.\n\nThank you for your volunteer work, and making the world a better place through the power of budgeting!",

It&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;ve been trying to get better at teaching for 6+ years, and we&amp;#39;re still learning every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Biggest thing -- the student must have a deep inner-drive to make it work. If there&amp;#39;s a way to drag a person to budgeting and make it stick, we&amp;#39;ve certainly never seen it. There must be an excitement, a hope, and a willingness to suck at it for a while. Without that ingredient, nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other useful pieces that have assisted folks (assuming they have the excitedment and energy to really create a budget that works): Get a tool that instills good habits and best practices (we love YNAB for its envelope methodology, and &amp;quot;every dollar gets a job&amp;quot; design); do it with accountability -- our married clients have much more success than single ones; plan for it to feel like you&amp;#39;re bad at budgeting for 3 months, and don&amp;#39;t expect to really feel a major difference until 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your volunteer work, and making the world a better place through the power of budgeting!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
