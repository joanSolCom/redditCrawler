In the United States, we live in a plutocracy. We are ruled by the rich. We live in an oligarchy, not only are we ruled by the rich, but we are ruled by a very small percentage of the very wealthy. The vast wealth that they control holds influence over our entire system. We cannot call ourselves a true democracy unless we have one person = one vote. The amount of dollars is currently outweighing the amount of votes that we have. This is the result as many decisions, not just recently, but also going back to the 70s. So how do we change this? We need to gain control of the White House, the Senate, and maintain the House of Representative. Bills have been introduced to overturn Citizens United, but there is nothing we can do without controlling all chambers. B just because we have democrats in control, that does not mean we won't have to struggle to push the money out! We have to gain enough control in the right places to hinder the impact of wealth on our elections but we have no choice to fight!",

That is heaven! &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We need to get big money out of our government. In the United States, we live in a plutocracy. We are ruled by the rich. We live in an oligarchy, not only are we ruled by the rich, but we are ruled by a very small percentage of the very wealthy. The vast wealth that they control holds influence over our entire system. We cannot call ourselves a true democracy unless we have one person = one vote. The amount of dollars is currently outweighing the amount of votes that we have. This is the result as many decisions, not just recently, but also going back to the 70s. So how do we change this? We need to gain control of the White House, the Senate, and maintain the House of Representative. Bills have been introduced to overturn Citizens United, but there is nothing we can do without controlling all chambers.

The vote on July 7th is not entirely tied to the election in November. Trump will face whoever the nominee may be in the generation but on July 7th, I am telling people to vote for Bernie Sanders so he can get delegates and have influence over the Democratic Party. After July 7th and from that point forward, I have been saying this for a year or longer, I will support whoever the Democratic Party nominee is. If it is Joe Biden, I will support Joe Biden. Am I happy about that? No. I am not. Would I have liked someone else? Absolutely. I wanted Bernie Sanders. But that's not what we have right now. We have to push for Bernie to get the delegates and push for our platform and once Joe Biden is the nominee, then we work for Biden to defeat Trump. Trump is the worst president of our lifetime. He is the head of a fascist movement building in the United States. His supporters are armed and violent -- just three weeks ago, the office of Homeland Security for the State of New Jersey declared that white supremacist organizations are the greatest threats to the safety of New Jerseyians. These groups have been building in strength since the election of Trump. The first step is to defeat Trump, look how he stirs up racial and ethnic hatred. We have a very dangerous trend in this country and if you do't think fascism can come to the United States, you are in for a rude awakening. The American Nazi Party in the 1930s used to hold rallies at Madison Square Garden and march up and down 5th Avenue! This weekend was the anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing, over 100 people were killed. We have a very dangerous trend in this country.",
