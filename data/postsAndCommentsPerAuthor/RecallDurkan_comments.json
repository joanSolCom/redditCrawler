        "body": "Thanks for clarifying. There's a few answers to this question:\n\nWhy did I personally start the recall process? I'm very familiar with the WTO demonstrations and the constitutional violations and the legal and political fallout that followed. I know how the Seattle Police Department is prone to pushing the protests into densely residential neighborhoods, and how residents have been arrested or pepper-sprayed or gassed just for the crime of living there. I saw it coming again, and I knew that recall was an option that people didn't know was available to them, and I wanted to make it available.\n\nWhy do people support the recall? There's two general groups that I've seen supporting the recall. One is generally more conservative, the folks that see what happened with violent deaths in Seattle and things they've seen on the news and believe the Mayor abandoned the safety of people in her city. The second group tends to be more on the left, frustrated about the way police are acting towards residents and protesters. This group tends to align with the TRO issued by Judge Jones on 6/12, saying that the actions of the police department were significantly motivated by the content of protesters' speech. The judge said the police were reacting, in other words.\n\nIf you want to do some reading, there are many many declarations of personal experiences that have been entered into court case(s). They describe how people have been physically impacted, someone almost died, someone's arm was broken yesterday, people have burns and respiratory problems. I had to leave my home because I couldn't breathe. Infants going to the ER. This seems to be the primary reason people support removing the mayor because she can make this stop and has not, she's also fighting restrictions on these weapons in court.\n\nA place to start: [https://www.aclu-wa.org/docs/azoulai-declaration](https://www.aclu-wa.org/docs/azoulai-declaration)\n\n[https://www.aclu-wa.org/cases/black-lives-matter-seattle-king-county-v-city-seattle](https://www.aclu-wa.org/cases/black-lives-matter-seattle-king-county-v-city-seattle)",
