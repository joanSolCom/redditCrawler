That&amp;#39;s because the House Committee had had 35+ hearing on tech-related subjects over the prior 18 months. The Senate committees had closer to ten. So they were just less familiar and practiced. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one other thing you can do: call and write your rep about tech issues. It forces them to actually think through them and give you an answer (and helps them practice)!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
