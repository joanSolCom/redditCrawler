I was yelling “I’m a journalist” when he spun me around and hit me with the baton. On the ground I yelled “I’m a journalist” and his response was “I don’t care get out of here.” So now I’m pursuing a complaint with the DCPD as a result of that assault. \n\nThink it deserves to be said that while it has not gotten as much press coverage reporters have also been harassed and attacked by protesters. The same night I was hit with a police baton I was surrounded by a few protesters and one of them attacked me, breaking my jaw in multiple places by hitting me with either a fist or a foreign object. I can’t confirm what hit me because I didn’t see it coming but based on the amount of damage down to my jaw I suspect it may have been a foreign object. You can see a video that I posted shorty after the attack on my twitter account, just search for my name and it’s the one with the profile pic of a guy with a helmet, gas mask and goggles on. That pic was taken by a friend in HK.\n\nAs far as attacks by police on journalists they are pretty common in Hong Kong and the US. In Hong Kong I was shot at by police with less lethal projectiles one night. I was the only person standing and there was a group of journalists taking cover in front of me and no protesters near us so I have to conclude that he was firing at journalists. I was also routinely pushed and threatened by HK police, as one night I was pepper sprayed directly in the face by an officer. I haven’t seen anyone specifically targeting head shots at reporters in the US, but I know that it is possible. One person that lost an eye described herself as an activist and journalist, which are completely different roles in a protest situation. Whatever her role was less lethal projectiles such as rubber bullets are not supposed to be fired at head height for exactly that reason. In HK an Indonesian journalist by the name of Veby Indah lost an eye from a similar situation where a police officer shot her in the eye with a beanbag round. The Hong Kong Police Force has refused to release the name of the officer so that she can file a civil suit, and to the best of my knowledge no disciplinary action was taken.",

I was yelling “I’m a journalist” when he spun me around and hit me with the baton. On the ground I yelled “I’m a journalist” and his response was “I don’t care get out of here.” So now I’m pursuing a complaint with the DCPD as a result of that assault. \n\nThink it deserves to be said that while it has not gotten as much press coverage reporters have also been harassed and attacked by protesters. The same night I was hit with a police baton I was surrounded by a few protesters and one of them attacked me, breaking my jaw in multiple places by hitting me with either a fist or a foreign object. I can’t confirm what hit me because I didn’t see it coming but based on the amount of damage down to my jaw I suspect it may have been a foreign object. You can see a video that I posted shorty after the attack on my twitter account, just search for my name and it’s the one with the profile pic of a guy with a helmet, gas mask and goggles on. That pic was taken by a friend in HK.\n\nAs far as attacks by police on journalists they are pretty common in Hong Kong and the US. In Hong Kong I was shot at by police with less lethal projectiles one night. I was the only person standing and there was a group of journalists taking cover in front of me and no protesters near us so I have to conclude that he was firing at journalists. I was also routinely pushed and threatened by HK police, as one night I was pepper sprayed directly in the face by an officer. I haven’t seen anyone specifically targeting head shots at reporters in the US, but I know that it is possible. One person that lost an eye described herself as an activist and journalist, which are completely different roles in a protest situation. Whatever her role was less lethal projectiles such as rubber bullets are not supposed to be fired at head height for exactly that reason. In HK an Indonesian journalist by the name of Veby Indah lost an eye from a similar situation where a police officer shot her in the eye with a beanbag round. The Hong Kong Police Force has refused to release the name of the officer so that she can file a civil suit, and to the best of my knowledge no disciplinary action was taken.",

I would note that it is incredibly helpful to get an external battery pack if that will increase the frames per second that you can capture. In the case of my camera it ups it from 6 to 9 frames per second, which can be a huge difference when you are taking pictures of things flying through the air. Also I can shoot for about 26-30 hours without switching batteries out which can be important in situations where you are unable to get to safe place to charge them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I have a photo in the book that is 800k people in the street, and 2 milion came out one day before I got there. That is more than 25 percent of HK&amp;#39;s population, and they are all ages. And (2) that the US is involved at all. I studied our govt&amp;#39;s policies for many years and while we have certainly instituted regime change in certain places there is not a shred of evidence that I could find that would suggest the US is involved in any way in the Hong Kong protests. I think some people just have a hard time understanding how badly a lot of Hong Kongers want HK to remain HK for as long as possible, even if that is only till 2047.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I don't have a car and my camera gear is the only thing in the world I own that costs more than 100 dollars (besides my tv which I bought 5 years ago) but I have thousands of dollars in camera gear. My accreditation is with a national association of press photographers called the NPPA, which anyone can join as long as they are willing to abide by rules that govern work as a journalist that they agree to. I now shoot for a couple freelance agencies out of NY but again am unwilling to discuss what I get paid. Get some good shots, make a website, apply to agencies as a freelancer would be my advice. The main advantage I have in journalism is that I studied govt policy in undergrad and have a law degree so I can understand a lot of what goes on with governments and movements probably better than the average individual. As far as waiting for the hard cover I'd recommend you buy the ebook as it has a lot more pics in it and the physical book will be at least 225 USD and the ebook is 10.",

I will say that I worked very hard in my life prior to journalism so I had a cushion coming in. I also live cheap. I don&amp;#39;t have a car and my camera gear is the only thing in the world I own that costs more than 100 dollars (besides my tv which I bought 5 years ago) but I have thousands of dollars in camera gear. My accreditation is with a national association of press photographers called the NPPA, which anyone can join as long as they are willing to abide by rules that govern work as a journalist that they agree to. I now shoot for a couple freelance agencies out of NY but again am unwilling to discuss what I get paid. Get some good shots, make a website, apply to agencies as a freelancer would be my advice. The main advantage I have in journalism is that I studied govt policy in undergrad and have a law degree so I can understand a lot of what goes on with governments and movements probably better than the average individual. As far as waiting for the hard cover I&amp;#39;d recommend you buy the ebook as it has a lot more pics in it and the physical book will be at least 225 USD and the ebook is 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
