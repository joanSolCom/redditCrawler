So you would get areas that were dominated by one cultural group but there would still be others present. How much integration you got would depend on the way in which the new group arrived – was it a violent invasion aiming to take over leadership or a few families looking for new opportunities? Intermarriage certainly took place.",

So you would get areas that were dominated by one cultural group but there would still be others present. How much integration you got would depend on the way in which the new group arrived – was it a violent invasion aiming to take over leadership or a few families looking for new opportunities? Intermarriage certainly took place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Their diet was based around bread and pottage (a stew made from beans, peas and onions) with little variation day by day. Families would keep animals to provide additional food if they could afford it, so eggs, milk and cheese would also have been available fairly regularly to some people. Meat was a luxury for most so it was only eaten in small quantities and every piece of the animal was used. Fruit and vegetables were primarily available when they were in season but could be dried and stored for use throughout the year.  \n\nThis is very different to what was available to the upper classes whose food was heavily spiced and far more varied.",

Their diet was based around bread and pottage (a stew made from beans, peas and onions) with little variation day by day. Families would keep animals to provide additional food if they could afford it, so eggs, milk and cheese would also have been available fairly regularly to some people. Meat was a luxury for most so it was only eaten in small quantities and every piece of the animal was used. Fruit and vegetables were primarily available when they were in season but could be dried and stored for use throughout the year.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is very different to what was available to the upper classes whose food was heavily spiced and far more varied.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I expect that most of what is there relates to the Abbey and it’s later history as a manor house and it would be fascinating to find out more. Finding artefacts from the battle itself would be amazing but unexpected. Very little was left behind after a medieval battle and the whole shape of the hill has been changed as a result of the building of the Abbey, so anything left has probably been moved around a lot and is probably under the old guest wing. The soil at Battle is also not particularly good for metals and iron tends to corrode badly in it.",

I expect that most of what is there relates to the Abbey and it’s later history as a manor house and it would be fascinating to find out more. Finding artefacts from the battle itself would be amazing but unexpected. Very little was left behind after a medieval battle and the whole shape of the hill has been changed as a result of the building of the Abbey, so anything left has probably been moved around a lot and is probably under the old guest wing. The soil at Battle is also not particularly good for metals and iron tends to corrode badly in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There was so much going on within a very short amount of time so the variables are vast. For example, if Stamford Bridge had not been fought at that time and Harald Hardrada was still a threat, could Harold have fielded so many men at Hastings or would he have had to split his army? If there had never been a Danish threat and Harold had only ever faced William he would have been in a much stronger position in England and William may never have made the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The capstone is so enormous, and its propped up somehow by magic on the uprights. I also have a bit of a soft spot for the passage graves that we care for on the Isles of Scilly – but that’s mostly because they have the most astonishing coastal views! North Wales has some amazing prehistoric sites, many of them looked after by our colleagues at CADW (the Welsh equivalent to English Heritage). I’d recommend going to Anglesey in order to see Bryn Celli Ddu and Barclodiad y Gawres – two amazing passage tombs. If you’re up in Snowdonia, I highly recommend seeking out Dyffryn Ardudwy burial chamber, and also Capel Garmon burial chamber which has fabulous views over the Snowdonian mountains.
