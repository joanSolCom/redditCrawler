We see customers more rapidly adopting SaaS-based applications like Office 365 and needing to ensure they protect their laptops with an increased remote workforce. This has led to increased relevance for Backup Exec given our recent investment and innovation in these areas. To directly help organizations adopt these necessary protection capabilities rapidly we have made our SaaS Backup and Desktop Laptop Options available for production use on extended trials   \n\n\n2- Support has several continuous improvement initiatives in place:  \n\n\nTeam approach to all cases – Support Technicians have continuous access to all levels of Support including Subject Matter Experts (a.k.a. Backline and Engineering resources). This allows any Support Tech to get an answer from the team if they cannot immediately answer the customer’s question   \n\n\nTraining and mentoring programs with regular, dedicated training time for every Support Technician   \n\n\nEnhancing our knowledge base with articles being constantly reviewed and shared to customers and Support Technicians  \n\n\n3 - We just released Backup Exec 21 with Day1 support for VMware vSphere 7, Ransomware Resilience v2, Simplified licensing and much more. Backup Exec typically has new releases 3-4 times a year and in the future we will continue to focus on enabling customers have an unified approach in protecting their workloads across cloud, virtual and physical environments. Key focus areas for addressing customer needs in future releases are on further enhancing ransomware resilience, simplifying the user experience, extending cloud capabilities and overall enabling customers to improve their Recovery Point Objectives and Recovery Time Objectives to recover faster and with fewer disruptions.  \n\n\n4 - We are always looking for new talent, especially in cloud, and have consistently grown our Backup Exec team over the last 2 years in these areas. Critical skills we look for are skills in C++, GO and Python, and experience in multi-threaded programming for cloud scale environments.
