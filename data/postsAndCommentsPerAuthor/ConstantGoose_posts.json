I've stumbled upon a noodle mystery and I wondered if anyone here might have the answer.\n\nSo as background: there's a great Thai restaurant supply store by my house where I occasionally go for  groceries. I was there last week, and stocked up on all kinds of noodles, including some dried noodles labeled \"Chinese Noodles,\" whose ingredients were flour, water, and salt. They were manufactured by a company I'd never heard of in Bangkok. \n\nWhen I went to cook them last night (for an otherwise delicious [egg noodle pad see ew](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/egg-noodle-pad-see-ew/)) I was surprised to discover they were unusually long--about three feet. But no problem, I figured we could cut them if necessary. However, when cooked they were UNBEARABLY salty! Borderline inedible, although, yes, we ate them anyway. When I looked at the package I was surprised to find that each serving contained 115% of the recommended daily sodium content, with five servings in a package.\n\nSo what were these noodles made for? Why were they so long? Is the salt content somehow connected to the length? Help me solve this noodle mystery!",

She's a very financially responsible person who has been supporting her immigrant mother and step father since she graduated from college, covering their housing and authorizing them to use her credit for essential purchases like food and clothing. Last week her step father died suddenly, and she discovered that he had taken out $30,000 of debt, $17,000 in her name and the remainder in her mother's. What are her legal options at this point for discharging the debt? Since she did authorize him to use her credit, does she have any recourse here? It's been so awful seeing her lose a parent who raised her since she was a child, and then to discover this financial abuse is just heartbreaking, I'm hoping we can find a way to assist her. Many thanks for your help!",
