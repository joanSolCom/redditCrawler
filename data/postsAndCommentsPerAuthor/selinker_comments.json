I did a post recently about [the Trolley Problem and how it matters in a pandemic](https://blog.politicsmeanspolitics.com/i-dont-take-responsibility-at-all-trump-fails-the-trolley-problem-192fe5c1eaf0). Basically, there are choices you have to make, and often all your choices have consequences, but *not choosing* is not one of the choices that usually works. So every day until this is gone, you're going to make meaningful choices about what you do: go to the store or not? go to the doctor or not? You should be weighing the risks and making choices that maximize your reward compared to the risk. But *not risking doing anything* is a recipe for disaster. That was Trump's strategy in November, December, January, and February (at least), and it produced a very bad outcome.",

I did a post recently about &lt;a href=\"https://blog.politicsmeanspolitics.com/i-dont-take-responsibility-at-all-trump-fails-the-trolley-problem-192fe5c1eaf0\"&gt;the Trolley Problem and how it matters in a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, there are choices you have to make, and often all your choices have consequences, but &lt;em&gt;not choosing&lt;/em&gt; is not one of the choices that usually works. So every day until this is gone, you&amp;#39;re going to make meaningful choices about what you do: go to the store or not? go to the doctor or not? You should be weighing the risks and making choices that maximize your reward compared to the risk. But &lt;em&gt;not risking doing anything&lt;/em&gt; is a recipe for disaster. That was Trump&amp;#39;s strategy in November, December, January, and February (at least), and it produced a very bad outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Here's what I said.\n\nThe 4-5-4 grid—that is, a 4-letter word, then a 5-letter word, then a 4-letter word across the top and down the side—is among the easiest grids to make, and usually fairly easy to fill with less obscure words. So they get shunted to the easier puzzles, which occur on Mondays and Tuesdays. The more experimental grids occur later in the week, as you'll see longer fill entries and bigger corners, but those sometimes necessitate harder words. That's why Saturday—the hardest—has almost no given black squares, because everybody's doing something different to make more wide-open and clever grids.\n\nAnother interesting element: the dark dot in the middle of Saturday but NOT Friday. Friday and Saturday are generally themeless, but Saturday is where people who are trying to set records for fewest number of entries and black squares park their grids. Having 15-letter entries can mess with that goal, so the Saturday puzzle is more likely to have two 7s on either side of the central black square both horizontally and vertically.\n\nMike",

Takes about 30 seconds, and now I have a fully interactive crossword. Another way is to use Adobe Acrobat's edit function. You can easily put a text bubble over the crosswords and type in directly.\n\nPuzzazz is also a great place for interactive puzzles on the iPad and iPhone, and The Maze of Games is available there too.\n\nHope that helps! The puzzles in this bundle are really good, so I hope folks'll give it a try. Worldbuilders, It Gets Better, and Child's Play would certainly thank you, anyway.\n\nMike",

Takes about 30 seconds, and now I have a fully interactive crossword. Another way is to use Adobe Acrobat&amp;#39;s edit function. You can easily put a text bubble over the crosswords and type in directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puzzazz is also a great place for interactive puzzles on the iPad and iPhone, and The Maze of Games is available there too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps! The puzzles in this bundle are really good, so I hope folks&amp;#39;ll give it a try. Worldbuilders, It Gets Better, and Child&amp;#39;s Play would certainly thank you, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Captain Britain can't leave the British Isles. Captain America is over in Avengers Mansion tying on a few highballs when he says 'Screw that limey jackwipe,' gets a 40, and chucks his shield across the Atlantic. KAPANG, it bounces off Captain Britain's head, and he's like 'Spot o' tea, guvnah! Where'd that bloomin' thing come from?'

Captain Britain can&amp;#39;t leave the British Isles. Captain America is over in Avengers Mansion tying on a few highballs when he says &amp;#39;Screw that limey jackwipe,&amp;#39; gets a 40, and chucks his shield across the Atlantic.

Where&amp;#39;d that bloomin&amp;#39; thing come from?&amp;#39; That kind of impossible?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My response to that, as a game designer obsessed with balance and game integrity, was to change NOTHING.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It's not about breaking in, it's about committing to the craft. If you're committed, you're in.\n\nI've had all sorts of things I regretted putting into games. Often they're individual cards; see my most recent post for the discussion of Runeforged Weapons and Collapsed Ceiling, and how we retrofit the game to accommodate them. Sometimes it's something we enable you to do, like the gambling layoff rule in the first printing of Lords of Vegas which we made optional in the second edition. And then sometimes there's an Underground Lake on the top floor of your haunted house.\n\nMost things only stay too challenging to produce for so long. it only took 19 years to produce The Maze of Games.",

If you&amp;#39;re committed, you&amp;#39;re in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had all sorts of things I regretted putting into games. Often they&amp;#39;re individual cards; see my most recent post for the discussion of Runeforged Weapons and Collapsed Ceiling, and how we retrofit the game to accommodate them. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s something we enable you to do, like the gambling layoff rule in the first printing of Lords of Vegas which we made optional in the second edition. And then sometimes there&amp;#39;s an Underground Lake on the top floor of your haunted house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most things only stay too challenging to produce for so long. it only took 19 years to produce The Maze of Games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
