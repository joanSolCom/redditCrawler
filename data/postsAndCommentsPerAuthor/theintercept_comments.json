Indeed, after she dropped out, the overwhelming majority swung toward Biden. So she didn’t want blowback from her supporters. Also, she thought he couldn’t win anymore, so her endorsement wouldn’t help, and she wasn’t sure when he’d drop out, and didn’t want to be stuck with him going all the way to the convention. There’s also been a lot of reporting that shows she was genuinely angry about the online toxicity, and held Sanders responsible for it. It didn’t help that they spent January accusing each other of lying. Like I said I think she made a mistake, and you can read my take on that at The Intercept, google me and something like, why Warren should endorse Sanders.",

Indeed, after she dropped out, the overwhelming majority swung toward Biden. So she didn’t want blowback from her supporters. Also, she thought he couldn’t win anymore, so her endorsement wouldn’t help, and she wasn’t sure when he’d drop out, and didn’t want to be stuck with him going all the way to the convention. There’s also been a lot of reporting that shows she was genuinely angry about the online toxicity, and held Sanders responsible for it.
