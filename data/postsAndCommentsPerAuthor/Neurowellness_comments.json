The standard chiropractic assessment is largely focused on biomechanics and structure. That said, assessment tools and intervention strategies available to the chiropractic neurologist with their higher level of understanding of the nervous system are virtually unlimited as we are treating the sensory systems mentioned above through vestibular and balance therapy, eye movement and vision therapies, cognitive exercises, metabolic interventions to support brain health, and so on. We do incorporate the chiropractic adjustment as part of therapy, although not everyone is a candidate for said treatment. Chiropractic neurologists are also able to recognize pathology (e.g. brain tumors, CVAs, MS, Parkinson's) through neurological examination and testing that would allow for improved public safety and coordination of care with the patient's medical team. \n\nFor board certification, a minimum of 300 post-graduate hours in an accredited neurology program are required, with rigorous board examinations and continuing education requirements implemented. Most practitioners in active practice have several thousand hours in post-graduate neurology under their belts.\n\nAs far as cost, much depends on areas of specialization, location, etc. Our practice offers intensive programs only where folks undergo neurological rehabilitation several hours per day for 1-3 week periods of time. This is quite different from routine chiropractic office visits that last anywhere from 5-20 minutes on average. Many insurance companies in some states have chiropractic neurologists on different reimbursement schedules due to their extensive training and expertise. For example, in the state of NC, I am able to perform and be reimbursed for nerve conduction studies, whereas traditional chiropractors and certain medical doctors are not.\n\nHope this helps - Thanks for your inquiry!

No attention was given to the fact that my full face helmet was split in half and behavior quite erratic my month in the hospital (which was significantly worsened with the high level narcotics I had to be on for pain). \n\nWhile I was always a good student, the struggles became very real when I returned to school (esp. given the 25+ credits per semester I was taking). The usual suspects (i.e. focus, attention, memory, etc.) were so bad that I had to devote twice the time to my studies and join study groups to fill in the blanks. This was difficult for me psychologically as I was one who tutored folks prior to the injury, and now I was the 'tutee'. \n\nWhile there are so many other factors and details here, suffice it to say I took it upon myself to make some big changes. I radically shifted my diet eliminating processed and refined foods, increasing health brainy fats and protein, and focused on whole foods for maximum nutritional and minimal caloric value. Exercise became a priority (I chose swimming for increasing brain oxygenation), I began to meditate regularly, and even shifted my social networks as my brain was simply not able to tolerate the typical drinking that ensues in college, particularly around test time.\n\nThis, unknowingly, was the first effort/study in what is now my life's work as TBI clinician. The truly sad part of this is that intervention for concussion/TBI is largely no different now than it was 22 years ago when I had my injury; unless you are able to access one of the relatively small handful of clinicians that are actively treating these injuries via functional applications/applied neuroscience.\n\nI have now seen countless individuals go on to complete elementary, high school, college, and grad schooling either through their focused efforts on brain and body health, help from clinicians well versed in concussion, or, hopefully, some combination of both. \n\n22 years later I still struggle (and this was not my only injury), although I have the knowledge-base and resources necessary to stay on track with my brain health and perform at the highest level I am able to. Most of this knowledge was gained through my intense interest and study on getting past these injuries.\n\nAll the best to you who strive to get back to your studies. Never lose hope!",
