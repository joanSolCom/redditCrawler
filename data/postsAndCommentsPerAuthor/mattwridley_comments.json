My Rational Optimist is about lots of other ways in which the world has got better too, and was published some time before Better Angels. I write about the decline in poverty, child mortality and disease, about the increase in income, lifespan and happiness (yes!). But I also try to explain why this has happened, and what it is about human beings that allows them to experience things like economic growth, innovation and technological progress. So the book is not just a catalogue of examples to redress the prevailing tendency to stress bad news and promote pessimism. It's also a full-fledged speculative theory about the course of human history!\n\nI think it is great that we live in an era of blogs, podcasts, online videos and other ways of reaching people, and I would urge academics to use these more democratic and bottom-up means of communication if they can, but I realise that the incentives do not always align.",

My Rational Optimist is about lots of other ways in which the world has got better too, and was published some time before Better Angels. I write about the decline in poverty, child mortality and disease, about the increase in income, lifespan and happiness (yes!). But I also try to explain why this has happened, and what it is about human beings that allows them to experience things like economic growth, innovation and technological progress. So the book is not just a catalogue of examples to redress the prevailing tendency to stress bad news and promote pessimism. It&amp;#39;s also a full-fledged speculative theory about the course of human history!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it is great that we live in an era of blogs, podcasts, online videos and other ways of reaching people, and I would urge academics to use these more democratic and bottom-up means of communication if they can, but I realise that the incentives do not always align.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

One lesson I learned was that conventional wisdom is often wrong: it was received wisdom that we were a low-risk bank. Another is that regulators can make things worse. In our case, we were heavily regulated, but the regulator focused almost entirely on the wrong risk, credit risk rather than liquidity risk, and this at least partly led us to do the same. I sometimes argue today that we are focusing on the wrong risk in political debates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
