For me, research is the most challenging when things don&amp;#39;t go as planned - sometimes experiments don&amp;#39;t work out or instruments don&amp;#39;t behave as expected, despite careful planning and attention to detail. It&amp;#39;s easy to get discouraged by this, but it definitely pays off when you keep working at it and things do go as planned :) What I enjoy most is working with my meteorite samples - I still get excited to hold pieces of other planetary bodies everyday!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
