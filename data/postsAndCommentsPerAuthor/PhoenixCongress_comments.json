Right now, guns and abortion are used as very divisive issues. Each party accusing the other of wanting to take one away. This legislation attempts to get to the core issue of abortions and gun deaths: poverty. Most abortions are related to economic factors, we can fix that with Universal Basic Income. Similarly, gun deaths are mostly suicides. We can dramatically decrease deaths of despair by ending economic insecurity. Losing a job doesn't have to be the end of the world. Drug or alcohol abuse is shown to decrease in UBI pilot programs.\n\nAmerica is hyper polarized right now. By putting a ten year freeze on gun and abortion bans, we have a cooling off period before re-visiting these issues.  The legislation does include universal background checks which approximately 90% of Americans support, but never seems to get anywhere in Congress.\n\n&gt;This bill also calls for sanctions to be levied against Saudi Arabia until 2025, full stop. \n\nWhat this bill says in Section 311 is that arms transfers to Saudi Arabia for their war against Yemen are restricted until 2025.  It also includes conditions where this restriction could be lifted after a six month cease fire. This language is taken from legislation that passed Congress, but was vetoed by president Trump.\n\nAmerica is profiting from the bombs that have created one of the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with tens of thousands of children starving to death as a result. The bomb that blew up a school bus with more than a dozen preteen boys was made right here in America. We can set a better example. Only [13%](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/poll-most-americans-oppose-u-s-support-for-the-war-on-yemen/) of Americans want to maintain or increase arms sales.\n\n&gt;2) With all due respect, do you truly believe that this bill has a chance of being passed in any recognizable state?\n\nThink outside the two party system. Congress has demonstrated that they are incapable of passing comprehensive legislation without putting in all sorts of perks for those with political influence. You can't write clean legislation in the swamp of Washington DC. Instead, the people can write a better bill outside of the swamp and then elect representatives that will rubber stamp it.\n\n&gt;So who is going to pass it? The solutions offered in this bill to the issues it addresses are all compromises between a the two parties’ positions, meaning that neither party will support it fully.\n\nThe strategy isn't to go after the political parties, but individual candidates. Candidates are greedy, they want to win. If they're in a close race, supporting this can put them over the top. It's one of the reasons we heard so much about fracking in the VP debate.\n\nThis isn't for Congress to debate and modify, it's for them to pass.\n\n&gt;Thank you for your time.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful questions.",

Instead, the people can write a better bill outside of the swamp and then elect representatives that will rubber stamp it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So who is going to pass it? The solutions offered in this bill to the issues it addresses are all compromises between a the two parties’ positions, meaning that neither party will support it fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strategy isn&amp;#39;t to go after the political parties, but individual candidates. Candidates are greedy, they want to win. If they&amp;#39;re in a close race, supporting this can put them over the top. It&amp;#39;s one of the reasons we heard so much about fracking in the VP debate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t for Congress to debate and modify, it&amp;#39;s for them to pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your thoughtful questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
