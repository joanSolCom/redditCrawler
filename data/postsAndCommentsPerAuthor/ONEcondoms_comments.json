We have a [Instagram video](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7__aaBp2eN/) of me and George showing you how to do this (fully clothed, don't worry). 2) You can use a measuring tape (or piece of string/paper and a ruler), and then [enter your measurements](https://www.myonecondoms.com/pages/enter-my-measurements). Or 3) We also have a [quick questionnaire](https://www.myonecondoms.com/pages/suggest-a-size) about previous condom experiences so you can get closer to a better size. Sometimes people don't feel comfortable measuring, or maybe they can't print a dick measuring tool on the office printer, ya know. Also we do sample kits so you can test some sizes before you buy.",

Having 1 condom size is like starting a shoe store where all shoes are a size 7, and wondering why your customers complain your shoes are either too small or too big. The condoms sold in store are what are often called \"Standard Size\" — which legit has nothing to do with average penis size. The standard size was developed years ago kinda as a \"catch all, lets-hope-this-fits-most\"-size. That's why it was developed so long, and standard condoms are actually too long for about 80% of people. Standard Condoms are usually 7.5 inches long, whereas average penis is 5.5 inches. So a lot of people have to roll up the condom (which then is like a tight rubber band at the base), or it slips off because it's too big. The shortest size we can currently manufacture with the new size standards is the E length code, which is 4.9 inches. And it's no wonder why it's so popular — because in reality it's very close to average penis size (5.5 inches). The other main challenge for people is that they say condoms are too \"small\" — what they really often mean is they're too tight. So the wider myONE size codes are also in the top sellers. Our top sellers really are typically sizes that are shorter than a standard condom, and ones that are also wider. But we have sales of every single size code in our 60 sizes, which to us is a beautiful world.",

The actual sizes of the condoms are slightly different though. The sizing recommendations on the FitKit are based on years of data and a formula for proper fit. The formula recommends a condom slightly longer than your actual penis measurement. This is to ensure there’s full coverage from base to tip, so you have maximum protection. The sizing recommendations also tend to recommend a condom slightly tighter than your actual penis circumference measurement, so that the condom will stay snug in place. For example, the myONE G22 condom is 9.4 inches long, and 5 inches circumference. But people also tend to have different preferences of how snug they want the condom to feel, which is why we do the sample kits — so you can test a few sizes before you buy or subscribe. ",
