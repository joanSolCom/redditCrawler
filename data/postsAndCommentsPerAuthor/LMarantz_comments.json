Our character design department was right at the front of the building, and there was no receptionist, so people would just walk in and our department was right there ( behind cubicles). We'd see Tim Curry (he voiced Nigel Thornberry) and other voice actors all the time. My favorite story is this: one day a girl was walking around in the studio, said her parent worked there and came to work with them. She was doing some kind of report for school and asked me a bunch of questions about what it was like to draw the Rugrats. I had just recently gotten hired so I was more than excited to share with her what I did. She didn't look as thrilled as I thought she should have been. Kind of bored with me. When we were done, I asked her who her parent was. Her dad was the voice actor for Donnie- Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nAs for getting into the field of Art &amp; Design, I did answer a question similar to that somewhere here.\n\nHow I got interested in the animation industry? I was in my junior year at CSUF studying fine arts. I wanted to be a teacher. Met with my counselor who told me I'd need to get my masters in order to teach. For some reason, writing a thesis at the end of another few years of school terrified me so I didn't want to do that. Some of my friends had started taking animation classes and were having WAY MORE FUN than what I was doing in my fine art classes, so I started taking classes with them. My mentor, Don Lagerberg, was pivotal in my move to Animation. He would always talk about the industry, how close were were (being in OC and studios are in LA- an hour away). I wanted a job after I graduated. I didn't want to do more schooling. So I switched from Fine Arts to Animation. But when I graduated, I didn't have enough experience and education, so I started taking classes at the Animation Union with artists like Glenn Vilppu, Karl Gnass and Charles Zembillas. I made a lot of friends who are doing incredible things in the industry now. \n\nI left the animation industry when I was pregnant with my 2nd child. I tell everyone this: Even though it took a lot of work to get into the industry, I knew that I was totally replaceable. But there is only one person who could be the mother to my child and that was me. SO I left. but only because I knew  I could start teaching at the school where I learned so much. I started co-teaching a few classes at  The Animation Academy in Burbank [https://www.theanimationacademy.com/](https://www.theanimationacademy.com/)  alongside people like Jose Lopez and Stephen Silver.

I realized I wanted to become an artist in Kindergarten when I mixed the blue tempera paint with the red tempera paint and blended the color purple. Then when I added white and discovered lavender, I fell in love. But it was when I won the coloring contest in Kindergarten that made me realize I was actually kind of good at art.\n3. Favorite food: right now? A baconburger with cheese and tater tots. Favorite dessert? Brownies. Always.\n4. My journey as an artist? Oh man. Studied fine art at CSUF. Took a portraiture class and my instructor told me I had a knack for it and could make money. Drove to Venice beach with an easel, paper and pencil. Set up and made some cash. Did that a few more times, then quit my phone reservation agent job at Marriott and started my own business called Portraits By Larissa while I was still in school. Made $200 in one weekend and knew I could survive as an artist. Partnered with a school friend doing caricatures. He eventually got a job at a small animation company. I followed him there. That was an addition to my resume that I used to apply at a bunch of other studios. They all said no. Eventually, more than one studio said yes and I got to choose. I chose The Rugrats.\n5. Major personal struggles as a creative? Self sabotage. I still do it to this day. Fortunately, I have a creative partner who is also my life partner and he keeps me on the straight path. I fumble often. But he's a good guide for me. Self doubt, and fear of failure is always staring at me. I try to conquer it by keeping my eyes on my own drawing board and focusing on enjoying the process.  What would I tell my younger self? Stop getting in your own way. Stop comparing yourself to others and focus on the joy of creating. Know that your path is unique and will be different than others which doesn't make it worse, it just makes it different. And most of all, don't be afraid to fail. \n6. Books or resources for learning? Oh my goodness, there are so many.

I'm planning on being a part of a new online animation school in the future so be on the look out for that.\n7. One thing I haven't done yet that I would like to do? Well, I'd really love to have that amazing awesome book signing at Barnes &amp; Noble that we were planning on having before the Covid quarantine. We scheduled our first book signing for April 18. The shutdown happened in mid March. That was my dream for so many years- to have a big book signing at the big B&amp;N that I'd visit often. That literally is the one thing I'd like to do.\n8. One skill besides drawing that helped me in my career? Being a good listener. I think that helps me to be a better communicator and to know what people expect of me, professionally speaking. Being open to critique of my work from other professional artists helps me to improve. It's hard to detach from your work, but if you can do it, it will only help you. Don't argue for your limitations, either. When someone says \"your hands are too big on your drawings' don't reply \"that's my style\" if you are still learning to draw hands. \n9. Working on the graphic novel is a long haul. You have to have a schedule assigned for everything. That's the only way to do it. Working for yourself, you have to be your own boss. Because I suck at self control, and because I have adhd and I love to be distracted, I have to use things like [Freedom](https://freedom.to/blog/?utm_source=dashboard) to keep me in line.

        "body": "So...\n\nBreaking into any industry (but specifically the animation/illustration industries) involves\n\n**Preparation**\n\nYou need to constantly be preparing yourself for opportunities. Building your portfolio and building your skill set are two of the most important things you can do to prepare for entering the industry. This needs to be done constantly.\n\n**Practice**\n\nBy constantly practicing your craft while your seeking a job, or a literary agent, you'll be *preparing* for getting a job. Working on personal projects is the best way to do this, because you'll likely be making something you love and you'll likely be doing it often because you enjoy it. Writing and illustrating a personal project becomes the dummy that you send in to an agent or an editor. Boarding your web comic or your animation film is creating your portfolio submission for an animation studio. The constant engagement of your art is practice. You need to get a lot of pencil mileage down and get the ugly drawings out in order to get to the good stuff.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nDo not give up. Collect the \"no's\" you get from agent, animation studios and editors. If you're lucky, they'll give you feedback, but don't expect it. Just keep going and keep practicing. The more you practice, the better you'll get. Eventually, you'll get to a point where you are not hearing No but you're hearing so many Yes's you have to choose where you want to go!\n\n**Professionalism**\n\nYour life is easily researchable on the internet. What you say and how you act can be held against you. In the classroom or on social media, if you are trying to go from amateur to pro, you need to think about making a switch over to the \"pro\" mentality. How would you behave if you were representing a company?  As the owner of OC Art Studios, I hired dozens of talented artists and had to interview probably a hundred people over the years. If someone didn't act in a professional way, they weren't gonna get a chance to prove it. I had to see it in action.\n\n**Connection**\n\nMaking personal connections with people is so important. Joining groups like  [https://womeninanimation.org/](https://womeninanimation.org/) or  [https://www.scbwi.org/](https://www.scbwi.org/)  helps you to connect with people who are on the same path as you. Being a genuinely good human helps more than you know. Being a jerk? Well, word travels fast. Be weary of that.\n\n**Determination**\n\nHaving a clear idea of where you want to be in your creative field will help you immensely because you'll spend less time spinning your wheels and more time being focused on gaining the skills that you need, working on the projects that will get you noticed and avoiding the things that will distract you from said goals. \n\n**Compatibility**\n\nIf you are looking to get into the animation industry, you absolutely have to be able to communicate with people and it's even better if you can be easily compatible with others. Animation is a collaborative effort. When you put yourself as a problem solver instead of a problem causer, you'll be seen as valuable. \n\nThe illustration industry is different. It's a lot of alone time- working from home and creating your work for books. I just have to make sure my wi-fi is being compatible with me and that's all I need. Of course, being compatible with editors and art directors helps, and so far, I've had great professional relationships with those people in my life, which makes my job much more enjoyable.\n\nLong answer of how to break into the industry.\n\nShort answer for how I did it? I did all of these things. My **compatibility** with my mentor led him to refer me to a **connection** with someone at the studio where I applied to. My **practice** **prepared** me for the animation test that I took. My **persistence** is what led me to call her and check in even after I wasn't hired the first time. My **determination** is what kept me at it so I didn't give up. My **professionalism** is what got me hired. \n\n:-)",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breaking into any industry (but specifically the animation/illustration industries) involves&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to constantly be preparing yourself for opportunities. Building your portfolio and building your skill set are two of the most important things you can do to prepare for entering the industry. This needs to be done constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By constantly practicing your craft while your seeking a job, or a literary agent, you&amp;#39;ll be &lt;em&gt;preparing&lt;/em&gt; for getting a job. Working on personal projects is the best way to do this, because you&amp;#39;ll likely be making something you love and you&amp;#39;ll likely be doing it often because you enjoy it. Writing and illustrating a personal project becomes the dummy that you send in to an agent or an editor. Boarding your web comic or your animation film is creating your portfolio submission for an animation studio. The constant engagement of your art is practice. You need to get a lot of pencil mileage down and get the ugly drawings out in order to get to the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not give up. Collect the &amp;quot;no&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; you get from agent, animation studios and editors. If you&amp;#39;re lucky, they&amp;#39;ll give you feedback, but don&amp;#39;t expect it. Just keep going and keep practicing. The more you practice, the better you&amp;#39;ll get. Eventually, you&amp;#39;ll get to a point where you are not hearing No but you&amp;#39;re hearing so many Yes&amp;#39;s you have to choose where you want to go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professionalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your life is easily researchable on the internet. What you say and how you act can be held against you. In the classroom or on social media, if you are trying to go from amateur to pro, you need to think about making a switch over to the &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; mentality.

Very Russian aesthetic, and very very opposite the western Disney style. The trick was in the line quality and the details. Especially with the Rocket Power show. Once you got the basic shape construction down and nailed the proportions, the trick was to make sure you added that bit of wonkiness to it. Lines weren't clean and efficient like you'd see in Disney stuff. A lot of extra weird things happening... like Chuckie's hair!! for GOODNESS SAKES!!! CHUCKIE'S HAIR IS A RIDICULOUS DESIGN! it's totally inefficient from a design pov. But that's what made him so adorable. I think that whenever people were brought onto the crew, they had to make sure that they were matching the existing style of the show as much as possible. Of course, there's designers, board artists and ultimately the animators who are responsible for that. \n\nIt's hard to keep your personal style out of a show, but just like when I watch Avatar, I can tell when a section of animation was boarded by one artist vs another because the range of expressions change or the subtle differences in the way Aang's eyes or Sokka's eyes vary from episode to episode. The main thing is to tell the story in a way that resonates emotionally with the viewer. \n\nMy favorite project to work on thus far has been Clyde! I love this little guy and I'm hoping that he does well. I hope that his books can be as popular as Clifford, Curious George and the Berenstain Bears. That way, I could be illustrating a dozen more Clyde books. We've already got ideas for more stories. We're just waiting for the public to catch up and fall in love with Clyde, too.\n\nThe production time of one book can vary. It takes roughly 6 months to complete the art. The stories were already done when they were sold to the publisher, so I'm not counting that time, which can be long, too. Once the art is done, it can take anywhere from another  6 months to a year to get the book on the shelf. It's hard to say, since we had worked on 4 in a row. The last Clyde book comes out in October 2020 and I finished the art for that in Feb 2020.\n\nFor info about my Blake Laser book, [you can follow my blog where I share my process](http://larissamarantz.com/making-a-graphic-novel.html). The book will be out in 2022.  IT'S SO FAR AWAY!! We're currently in the revision process of the manuscript and I've begun designing characters and thumbnailing pages. I won't be able to officially start paneling art until the draft is approved by the editor.",

Set in the 24th Century, a 12-year old inventor, [Blake Laser](http://larissamarantz.com/making-a-graphic-novel.html), along with her parents and her annoying older brother, must stop aliens from stealing the sun's energy which would lead to the total destruction of earth within 48 hours. I'm excited to create a story with characters that look like me and my family.\n\nI'm doing my best to promote our children's book debut [Clyde the Hippo](http://clydethehippo.com/index.html) series. It's been difficult to promote during Covid quarantine. We were looking forward to doing school visits and library visits, but that's not happening. So I've been doing my best to promote the book to the kids in my neighborhood. I draw Clyde the Hippo in chalk all over the place when I take my daily walks. I am now known as \"the Clyde the Hippo lady\" to all the little kids in my neighborhood.  \n\nAlso, with the recent racial justice protests, my husband and I felt it best to redirect my energy in a creative way. So we are currently working on a picture book about systemic racism (if you can believe a topic as complex as that can be boiled down to a simple enough concept for a 32 page picture book,) The topic is challenging, but I believe we've come up with a really powerful story with emotional images. \n\n[I'm also dedicated to teaching a new generation of Black animators and illustrators to help build a more diverse creative industry.](http://larissamarantz.com/drawing-for-animators--illustrators.html) I was one of only a handful of Black artists on the Rugrats crew and even though it's been over a decade since I've been there, I know that the diversity is still lacking. I am doing my best to fight the false argument of \"there's just not enough BIPOC talent.\"  So, for the next few months, I am teaching online classes to over 50 BIPOC scholars who have been granted funds to attend through a number of generous donors in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am working with my husband, author Keith Marantz, on a graphic novel called Blake Laser. Set in the 24th Century, a 12-year old inventor, &lt;a href=\"http://larissamarantz.com/making-a-graphic-novel.html\"&gt;Blake Laser&lt;/a&gt;, along with her parents and her annoying older brother, must stop aliens from stealing the sun&amp;#39;s energy which would lead to the total destruction of earth within 48 hours. I&amp;#39;m excited to create a story with characters that look like me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing my best to promote our children&amp;#39;s book debut &lt;a href=\"http://clydethehippo.com/index.html\"&gt;Clyde the Hippo&lt;/a&gt; series. It&amp;#39;s been difficult to promote during Covid quarantine. We were looking forward to doing school visits and library visits, but that&amp;#39;s not happening. So I&amp;#39;ve been doing my best to promote the book to the kids in my neighborhood. I draw Clyde the Hippo in chalk all over the place when I take my daily walks. I am now known as &amp;quot;the Clyde the Hippo lady&amp;quot; to all the little kids in my neighborhood.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, with the recent racial justice protests, my husband and I felt it best to redirect my energy in a creative way. So we are currently working on a picture book about systemic racism (if you can believe a topic as complex as that can be boiled down to a simple enough concept for a 32 page picture book,) The topic is challenging, but I believe we&amp;#39;ve come up with a really powerful story with emotional images. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://larissamarantz.com/drawing-for-animators--illustrators.html\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m also dedicated to teaching a new generation of Black animators and illustrators to help build a more diverse creative industry.&lt;/a&gt; I was one of only a handful of Black artists on the Rugrats crew and even though it&amp;#39;s been over a decade since I&amp;#39;ve been there, I know that the diversity is still lacking. I am doing my best to fight the false argument of &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s just not enough BIPOC talent.&amp;quot;  So, for the next few months, I am teaching online classes to over 50 BIPOC scholars who have been granted funds to attend through a number of generous donors in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
