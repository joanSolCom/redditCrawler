One thing I think is really neat is the level generator we built.It reads a pixel map which we paint in Photoshop and automatically places the environmental assets once imported to Unity.We based it on a 2D side scroller Level Generator by Brackeys and adapted it to our isometric 3D world. So to allow objects to overlap we created individual maps for the ground and assets placed on top of it which are tailored to our needs. For example the map which generates the floor not only places the woven straps but also automatically rotates and aligns them to build the weave and if we paint tears at a place on the map Unity will generate the shader effects at the right place so the player can mend it. We have a bit more in depth blog post about it here: [https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/level-generation](https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/level-generation)  \nLater on we also created maps which automatically built the cord (the thick border around every level) which is made in Houdini. I think this is something that easily could be used by other games which use a lot of modular assets like we do. It sure saved us a lot of time (especially with the ground cause moving all those small assets by hand is a real pain).  \nDuring our prototyping phase we also used a visual scripting tool called playmaker which helped us a lot especially at rapidly implementing and iterating the enemies in Weaving Tides. We of course had to rewrite a lot of it later so it is easier to take care of bugs and communicates well with other systems, but it saved us a lot of time and allowed the whole team to quickly test out and show off their ideas.

It basically consists of several components, which allow us to link various actions to specific events and triggers directly in the inspector. It's most likely common knowledge, but if there is interest I can ask our programmer to give a more in depth explanation : )",

There  wasn't one specific source of inspiration, but many different ones like  games like Flower and Journey and various Ghibli movies.  \nFor the  inhabitants of NIVA's enchanted forest and its puzzle mechanics, the  anime series Mushishi as well as documentaries about forests were an  invaluable inspiration to me. Telling you about this reminds me that  there were so many more ideas for further puzzles and hidden secrets,  but only a few of them could make it into the game - but I guess this is  true for almost every game out there :' )\n\nFor  Weaving Tides the first inspiration sparked on the same day we  exhibited NIVA in a small Austrian town called Hallein. When went for a  walk Ren saw a tree whose bark looked almost like it was woven. This and  her previous education at a fashion school made her instantly think  \"what if the whole world was woven?\". She was fascinated by this thought  and further explored it: how would such a world function, which  creatures would live in it?

Take a look at their projects, give feedback and show them the work you are most proud of. Talk and get to know them - basically - make friends.  \nTake part in as many game jams as possible. It is a lot easier to find team mates for small new projects and once they have had a good working experience with you they will very likely get back to you for bigger projects or recommend you to their peers. Game jam projects will also give you a way better understanding of what game projects actually need.  \nCreate a really good portfolio: The problem I have with a lot of audio applications we get is that they are not really relevant to us. Many audio artists have portfolios full of cinematic scores wich are arguably beautiful but nothing we can use for a cute and quirky indie adventure game. So create categories in your portfolios for different genres and also include SFX. Learn how to create good SFX which work in-game. Don't only make tracks available but actually show videos of games or game jam projects in your portfolio which you did the SFX for. It is so important to see your work in context!  \nLearn how to implement audio into the engine with tools like Fmod. This is incredibly valuable and something that you should present very visible in your portfolio! Implementing audio is paintstaking work and a lot of that goes into making the audio dynamic, well mixed and ensure that it acts as a supporting cue for the gameplay not as a distraction. If a tech artist or programmer have to do it (which don't have a lot of experience with audio) it will simply end up sounding terrible. So an audio artist who is good at implementing their work is worth their weight in gold!  \n\n\nI hope this didn't discourage you!

It is usually extremely difficult to directly land a position as a narrative designer or quest writer as your first job so here are some tips to start out:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Try to take part in as many game jams as possible and build your network through them. Take the role of a writer in the team, but try to help out with other tasks as well. A somewhat related position would be Level Design. You can work on your visual storytelling skills while creating levels and dressing sets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Think about which kind of game productions you would like to have been a part of. Write additional quests for these existing games. While writing those quests always keep the game's mechanics in mind as well as the experience of the player. This will show possible employers that you are able to work within an existing framework and will give you a better undestanding of how the narrative has to interact with the game mechanics.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Create a Twitter account. A very large part of the game development industry is active on Twitter. Interact with other smaller devs on the platform to further expand your network and keep your eyes open for recruitment announcemens you are interested in.\n\n(copied from a similar question above)\n\nIf you are just starting out and want to learn about writing for games there is no better way than to analyze the kind of games you would want to write. Don't only analyze the writing itself but also analyze it in the whole context of the game. The narrative usually comes AFTER the gameplay and basic level design are already set in place so it usually serves the purpose of giving the other features context or a goal for the player.   \n\n\nWatch a lot of the narrative related and non-narrative talks on the GDC Youtube:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y\\_MQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ)   \nThose are an incredibly valuable resource.",

Don&amp;#39;t only analyze the writing itself but also analyze it in the whole context of the game. The narrative usually comes AFTER the gameplay and basic level design are already set in place so it usually serves the purpose of giving the other features context or a goal for the player.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch a lot of the narrative related and non-narrative talks on the GDC Youtube:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThose are an incredibly valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Most of them were german so I don't have any english recommendations except \"Business Plans for Dummies\".\n\nThe three most essential questions of a business plan are:\n\n1. What is the USP?\n2.  How will you market and distribute your product?\n3. How will you finance the production?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. One of the most important parts of a business plan is the USP or unique selling point. What makes your product truly unique and desirable? Which problems of your customers does it solve? Identify what makes your product unique and desirable. Find out why people would want it.\n2. To get a better grasp on marketing and distribution we did a lot of lookalike research: What are games similar to ours? How many people are working on them? How long were they in production? How long are those games? How much do they cost? How many units did they sell? Where can we find their communities? We took all of the data we could find and put it in a spreadsheet to analyze it. This helped us a lot with setting realistic expectations regarding sales and also with finding out what we needed to focus on in our game in order for it to be attractive to those who play similar games. We also did a lot of research on how and where those teams presented and marketed their games. Having a lot of competitors to compare your product to and underline your decisions will also give your business plan more credibility.\n3. For creative projects you initially will need to rely on your own savings or money from family and friends. Banks usually only give out loans to projects which invest it in physical goods like heavy machinery (which the bank can collect if the debt is overdue). Another option would be angel investors (which are really hard to come by) or public grants (which are different in every country and sometimes non-existent). If you live in Europe you could look up the grant „creative Europe“. An option for artists would also be Patreon. For Patreon to work you will need to put in heavy community-building efforts and it would most likely not fully finance your monthly expenses, but will take some strain from your savings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know where exactly you want to set foot in the art world but I think regardless of what you do it is essential to reach out to others in your field of work who are at a comparable spot in their career as you are (same amount of experience, similar amount of following/fame), befriend them and build your network. You can use this network to lift each others up, exchange information and perhaps even collaborate.",

Most of them were german so I don&amp;#39;t have any english recommendations except &amp;quot;Business Plans for Dummies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three most essential questions of a business plan are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the USP?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; How will you market and distribute your product?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How will you finance the production?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One of the most important parts of a business plan is the USP or unique selling point. What makes your product truly unique and desirable? Which problems of your customers does it solve? Identify what makes your product unique and desirable. Find out why people would want it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To get a better grasp on marketing and distribution we did a lot of lookalike research: What are games similar to ours? How many people are working on them? How long were they in production? How long are those games? How much do they cost? How many units did they sell? Where can we find their communities? We took all of the data we could find and put it in a spreadsheet to analyze it. This helped us a lot with setting realistic expectations regarding sales and also with finding out what we needed to focus on in our game in order for it to be attractive to those who play similar games. We also did a lot of research on how and where those teams presented and marketed their games. Having a lot of competitors to compare your product to and underline your decisions will also give your business plan more credibility.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For creative projects you initially will need to rely on your own savings or money from family and friends. Banks usually only give out loans to projects which invest it in physical goods like heavy machinery (which the bank can collect if the debt is overdue). Another option would be angel investors (which are really hard to come by) or public grants (which are different in every country and sometimes non-existent). If you live in Europe you could look up the grant „creative Europe“. An option for artists would also be Patreon. For Patreon to work you will need to put in heavy community-building efforts and it would most likely not fully finance your monthly expenses, but will take some strain from your savings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where exactly you want to set foot in the art world but I think regardless of what you do it is essential to reach out to others in your field of work who are at a comparable spot in their career as you are (same amount of experience, similar amount of following/fame), befriend them and build your network. You can use this network to lift each others up, exchange information and perhaps even collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "We didn't do any type of paid marketing or ads for NIVA. Most of the marketing we did was social media marketing and at that time we still used tumblr to share gifs and screenshots. The game was picked up by octocurio who shares a lot of gaming gifs and had a very wide reach on tumblr at that time and the post about NIVA went viral.   \nNIVA was also released as \"pay what you want\" on [itch.io](https://itch.io) and thanks to that quickly reached the front page where it lingered for at least a week or two.   \nThe game was very visually appealing and it was basically free if you decided to not pay anything. Because of that a lot of small streamers and Youtubers picked up NIVA which pushed it even further.   \nI think we also (by chance) hit the perfect timing to release the game. Since the release of Journey there weren't many popular relaxing exploration-based games and NIVA was the first (or one of the first, I obviously don't know the whole games market) with a forest theme. Very shortly after NIVAs release a lot of nature and foresty exploration games were released and a lot of them went big. So I feel like there really was a demand for those types of games. All this showed me that it is important to observe the market to find your particular niche.  For Weaving Tides we tried to not leave things to chance.\n\n  \nIf you are creating a game/app and can't invest large sums in ads or a marketing you have to do a lot of legwork.  I cannot recommend one particular thing since the popularity of Weaving Tides is the sum of all the things we did so far.  \nWe started to share our progress basically at the same time as we  started to work full time on the project about 2 years ago. We posted  very regularly and tried to do at least 1-2 project updates a week. We also tried a variety of different channels before we found the ones which work best for us (Twitter, Newsletter &amp; Discord)  \nEarly in the development of Weaving Tides we also went to a lot of gaming events where we showcased the game. Events never have a huge impact on tangible things like wishlists or news coverage, but what it did for us was that we found our most dedicated fans there. Those who stuck with us during the whole time up until now, who are advocates for the game and who basically built the ground work for the community we have now.  \nOne more things which is really important imo is try to make friends with a lot of devs who are in the same place as you are. (Who have the same experience, a similar amount of reach, a similar game and so on) It really goes a long way when you cheer each other on, give shout outs and exchange tips.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t do any type of paid marketing or ads for NIVA. Most of the marketing we did was social media marketing and at that time we still used tumblr to share gifs and screenshots. The game was picked up by octocurio who shares a lot of gaming gifs and had a very wide reach on tumblr at that time and the post about NIVA went viral.&lt;br/&gt;\nNIVA was also released as &amp;quot;pay what you want&amp;quot; on &lt;a href=\"https://itch.io\"&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to that quickly reached the front page where it lingered for at least a week or two.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe game was very visually appealing and it was basically free if you decided to not pay anything. Because of that a lot of small streamers and Youtubers picked up NIVA which pushed it even further.&lt;br/&gt;\nI think we also (by chance) hit the perfect timing to release the game. Since the release of Journey there weren&amp;#39;t many popular relaxing exploration-based games and NIVA was the first (or one of the first, I obviously don&amp;#39;t know the whole games market) with a forest theme. Very shortly after NIVAs release a lot of nature and foresty exploration games were released and a lot of them went big. So I feel like there really was a demand for those types of games. All this showed me that it is important to observe the market to find your particular niche.  For Weaving Tides we tried to not leave things to chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are creating a game/app and can&amp;#39;t invest large sums in ads or a marketing you have to do a lot of legwork.  I cannot recommend one particular thing since the popularity of Weaving Tides is the sum of all the things we did so far.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe started to share our progress basically at the same time as we  started to work full time on the project about 2 years ago. We posted  very regularly and tried to do at least 1-2 project updates a week. We also tried a variety of different channels before we found the ones which work best for us (Twitter, Newsletter &amp;amp; Discord)&lt;br/&gt;\nEarly in the development of Weaving Tides we also went to a lot of gaming events where we showcased the game. Events never have a huge impact on tangible things like wishlists or news coverage, but what it did for us was that we found our most dedicated fans there. Those who stuck with us during the whole time up until now, who are advocates for the game and who basically built the ground work for the community we have now.&lt;br/&gt;\nOne more things which is really important imo is try to make friends with a lot of devs who are in the same place as you are. (Who have the same experience, a similar amount of reach, a similar game and so on) It really goes a long way when you cheer each other on, give shout outs and exchange tips.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

One thing I think is really neat is the level generator we built.It reads a pixel map which we paint in Photoshop and automatically places the environmental assets once imported to Unity.We based it on a 2D side scroller Level Generator by Brackeys and adapted it to our isometric 3D world. So to allow objects to overlap we created individual maps for the ground and assets placed on top of it which are tailored to our needs. For example the map which generates the floor not only places the woven straps but also automatically rotates and aligns them to build the weave and if we paint tears at a place on the map Unity will generate the shader effects at the right place so the player can mend it. We have a bit more in depth blog post about it here: [https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/level-generation](https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/level-generation)  \nLater on we also created maps which automatically built the cord (the thick border around every level) which is made in Houdini. I think this is something that easily could be used by other games which use a lot of modular assets like we do. It sure saved us a lot of time (especially with the ground cause moving all those small assets by hand is a real pain).  \nDuring our prototyping phase we also used a visual scripting tool called playmaker which helped us a lot especially at rapidly implementing and iterating the enemies in Weaving Tides. We of course had to rewrite a lot of it later so it is easier to take care of bugs and communicates well with other systems, but it saved us a lot of time and allowed the whole team to quickly test out and show off their ideas. We also wrote a blog on that: [https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/creating-mobs](https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/creating-mobs)  \nSince I'm an artist I'm also very thankful to the system our programmer came up with which allows us to easily create simple setups (like spawn objects, play VFX/SFX, save puzzle states) without the need of writing scripts themselves. It basically consists of several components, which allow us to link various actions to specific events and triggers directly in the inspector. It's most likely common knowledge, but if there is interest I can ask our programmer to give a more in depth explanation : )",

For example the map which generates the floor not only places the woven straps but also automatically rotates and aligns them to build the weave and if we paint tears at a place on the map Unity will generate the shader effects at the right place so the player can mend it. We have a bit more in depth blog post about it here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/level-generation\"&gt;https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/level-generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nLater on we also created maps which automatically built the cord (the thick border around every level) which is made in Houdini. I think this is something that easily could be used by other games which use a lot of modular assets like we do. It sure saved us a lot of time (especially with the ground cause moving all those small assets by hand is a real pain).&lt;br/&gt;\nDuring our prototyping phase we also used a visual scripting tool called playmaker which helped us a lot especially at rapidly implementing and iterating the enemies in Weaving Tides. We of course had to rewrite a lot of it later so it is easier to take care of bugs and communicates well with other systems, but it saved us a lot of time and allowed the whole team to quickly test out and show off their ideas. We also wrote a blog on that: &lt;a href=\"https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/creating-mobs\"&gt;https://www.followfeathers.com/blog/creating-mobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nSince I&amp;#39;m an artist I&amp;#39;m also very thankful to the system our programmer came up with which allows us to easily create simple setups (like spawn objects, play VFX/SFX, save puzzle states) without the need of writing scripts themselves. It basically consists of several components, which allow us to link various actions to specific events and triggers directly in the inspector. It&amp;#39;s most likely common knowledge, but if there is interest I can ask our programmer to give a more in depth explanation : )&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There  wasn't one specific source of inspiration, but many different ones like  games like Flower and Journey and various Ghibli movies.  \nFor the  inhabitants of NIVA's enchanted forest and its puzzle mechanics, the  anime series Mushishi as well as documentaries about forests were an  invaluable inspiration to me. Telling you about this reminds me that  there were so many more ideas for further puzzles and hidden secrets,  but only a few of them could make it into the game - but I guess this is  true for almost every game out there :' )\n\nFor  Weaving Tides the first inspiration sparked on the same day we  exhibited NIVA in a small Austrian town called Hallein. When went for a  walk Ren saw a tree whose bark looked almost like it was woven. This and  her previous education at a fashion school made her instantly think  \"what if the whole world was woven?\". She was fascinated by this thought  and further explored it: how would such a world function, which  creatures would live in it? After revisiting this idea for one year, she  pitched it to the three of us and we decided to go forward with it.  \nSo  the woven world was the base for Weaving Tides, everything else came  afterwards.

If you want to work in a small studio where you have more creative control of the product I'd recommend not only learning 3D and animation but also getting familiar with an engine like unreal engine or unity and learn how to correctly import your assets and perhaps even learn how to make some basic shaders.  \nIf you want to work on large productions I'd recommend really specializing your skills to a very particular niche. Since you have an interior architecture degree this is the perfect groundwork to build onto - study interior architecture in games, build your own game environments inspired by it and fill your portfolio. A big difference between 3d visualization for architecture and games is performance.   \nYou will have to get familiar with optimizing your meshes, sculpting programs like Zbrush and baking different kind of maps.  \n\n\nYou could also take a look at level design. A lot of level designers study architecture and interior design in order to better understand the navigation behaviour of their players and improve their maps.",

The larger the studio is the more specialized the positions are they are looking to fill. If you want to work in a small studio where you have more creative control of the product I&amp;#39;d recommend not only learning 3D and animation but also getting familiar with an engine like unreal engine or unity and learn how to correctly import your assets and perhaps even learn how to make some basic shaders.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you want to work on large productions I&amp;#39;d recommend really specializing your skills to a very particular niche. Since you have an interior architecture degree this is the perfect groundwork to build onto - study interior architecture in games, build your own game environments inspired by it and fill your portfolio. A big difference between 3d visualization for architecture and games is performance.&lt;br/&gt;\nYou will have to get familiar with optimizing your meshes, sculpting programs like Zbrush and baking different kind of maps.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could also take a look at level design. A lot of level designers study architecture and interior design in order to better understand the navigation behaviour of their players and improve their maps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Write additional quests for these existing games. While writing those quests always keep the game's mechanics in mind as well as the experience of the player. This will show possible employers that you are able to work within an existing framework and will give you a better undestanding of how the narrative has to interact with the game mechanics.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Create a Twitter account.

A very large part of the game development industry is active on Twitter. Interact with other smaller devs on the platform to further expand your network and keep your eyes open for recruitment announcemens you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

To get a better grasp on marketing and distribution we did a lot of lookalike research: What are games similar to ours? How many people are working on them? How long were they in production? How long are those games? How much do they cost? How many units did they sell? Where can we find their communities? We took all of the data we could find and put it in a spreadsheet to analyze it. This helped us a lot with setting realistic expectations regarding sales and also with finding out what we needed to focus on in our game in order for it to be attractive to those who play similar games. We also did a lot of research on how and where those teams presented and marketed their games. Having a lot of competitors to compare your product to and underline your decisions will also give your business plan more credibility.\n3.

Once we had a working prototype we also applied for a governmental grant which funds projects at the intersection between business and art.

Because of that a lot of small streamers and Youtubers picked up NIVA which pushed it even further.   \nI think we also (by chance) hit the perfect timing to release the game. Since the release of Journey there weren't many popular relaxing exploration-based games and NIVA was the first (or one of the first, I obviously don't know the whole games market) with a forest theme. Very shortly after NIVAs release a lot of nature and foresty exploration games were released and a lot of them went big. So I feel like there really was a demand for those types of games.
