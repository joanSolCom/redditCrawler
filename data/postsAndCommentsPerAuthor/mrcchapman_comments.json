Rolling over in the gurney, I cough and sputter my way back to the land of the living, curling up instinctively into a fetal position. The bottom of my feet touch metal, causing me to pull away from the chill and whimper pathetically.\n\n\"Holy shi... Dr Michaels! Dr Michaels!\" My ears ache with every sound, the new membranes unused to vibration, my ear canals clean-as-a-goddamn-whistle and free of wax. Every nerve seems to be firing simultaneously, coming to life and sending messages that overload my brain. It's almost impossible. It's too much. I close my eyes, scrunch them tight, and try to center myself, focusing on the moment. It's no good: my brain is overloaded, regurgitating memories and sensations like a film projector set to fast forward, each image moving past in an otherworldly blur as the reel spools to its doom. \n\nSounds of rushing feet. Smells of sterile floors. Touches from concerned staff. Tastes of my own bile and saliva. Too much. Too much...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe void. The same void I felt when that car hit; when I felt time freeze and a wall of eternity come crashing into my body to end my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sara.\" Mom's voice. I'd recognise it anywhere. The agony of sensation has gone away now, replaced by comfort. Her touch is warm and soft, her scent of lavender reminding me of childhood.

I croak in reply, and someone puts a straw to my lips, allowing me to suck in water. \"Are you OK, honey?\"\n\n  \n\"Car acci...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"That's right. That was a month ago. You died, honey. You... you didn't live. They put you in TBR. But, unlike all the others, you woke up. You woke up! You came back!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTBR. Total Body Replacement. Rebuilding the dead one cell at a time, creating a whole new you. \n\nI remember it from my lectures on campus, how we could synthesise flesh, bone and sinew, how we could create hormones and enyzmes, how the impossible complexity of the brain - the essence of thought - was little more than nervous circuits and chemistry that could be replicated. \n\nI remember TBR not working, how all the dead came back as mere flesh, lacking the promethean spark of life. \n\nI remember the debates, the arguments on ethics, on the consequences of man playing God. Of how it proved the soul was divine that those who were rebuilt came back to life only in the functional, ugly sense. \n\nI'd always sworn that, once I'd finished med school, I'd sign a waiver that they couldn't do it to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Too much,\" I mutter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh, honey, we'd have paid all we had to have you back, whatever the risk.\" Mom's voice is soft, but not what I meant. I shake my head, sucking down more of the fluid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No,\" I say, untested muscles aching as I push my new mouth into a smile. \"I mean... get the doctor. Quick.\" She departs, and I suck on the straw again. It's all so obvious now; I know why TBR patients are simple, living corpses, with no apparent cognitive function. Multiple sets of footsteps; the doctor and his whole retinue. I wait until they come into the room and begins his spiel, but I wave him into silence. \"Listen, stop the TBRs,\" I gasp. \"I know why they don't work.\"\n\n\"Ms Daniels, why don't you just take it easy and...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"NO!\" I snap. \"Listen. Just... listen. The new bodies are overloading. The whole thing is new. New ears, new eyes, new lungs, new fucking nerve endings. When you snap 'em back, the TBR brains don't know how to handle it. Your brain throws sharp, loud, screaming input at you until it just shuts down. You're frying their minds with sensory overload. It's too much. You've got to... I don't know, put them in a womb environment or something. Dampen the noise. Or nobody's going to wake up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's silence. Silence followed by a rush of bodies, of interns heading to make desperate phonecalls. For the next hour, the doctors scramble to alert the world. And, when they finally hit the scientific version of a mute button, the TBRs respond. They struggle, they ache, but they come alive once again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have defeated death, all because I had a slither, a mere, pathetic slither, less sensation than the limit my mind could take.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I begin my second life by doing something I never did in my first: thanking my lucky stars I'm blind.",

I wait until they come into the room and begins his spiel, but I wave him into silence. &amp;quot;Listen, stop the TBRs,&amp;quot; I gasp. &amp;quot;I know why they don&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ms Daniels, why don&amp;#39;t you just take it easy and...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NO!&amp;quot; I snap. &amp;quot;Listen. Just... listen. The new bodies are overloading. The whole thing is new. New ears, new eyes, new lungs, new fucking nerve endings. When you snap &amp;#39;em back, the TBR brains don&amp;#39;t know how to handle it. Your brain throws sharp, loud, screaming input at you until it just shuts down. You&amp;#39;re frying their minds with sensory overload. It&amp;#39;s too much. You&amp;#39;ve got to... I don&amp;#39;t know, put them in a womb environment or something. Dampen the noise. Or nobody&amp;#39;s going to wake up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s silence. Silence followed by a rush of bodies, of interns heading to make desperate phonecalls. For the next hour, the doctors scramble to alert the world. And, when they finally hit the scientific version of a mute button, the TBRs respond. They struggle, they ache, but they come alive once again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have defeated death, all because I had a slither, a mere, pathetic slither, less sensation than the limit my mind could take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I begin my second life by doing something I never did in my first: thanking my lucky stars I&amp;#39;m blind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Rolling over in the gurney, I cough and sputter my way back to the land of the living, curling up instinctively into a fetal position. The bottom of my feet touch metal, causing me to pull away from the chill and whimper pathetically.\n\n\"Holy shi... Dr Michaels! Dr Michaels!\" My ears ache with every sound, the new membranes unused to vibration, my ear canals clean-as-a-goddamn-whistle and free of wax. Every nerve seems to be firing simultaneously, coming to life and sending messages that overload my brain. It's almost impossible. It's too much. I close my eyes, scrunch them tight, and try to center myself, focusing on the moment. It's no good: my brain is overloaded, regurgitating memories and sensations like a film projector set to fast forward, each image moving past in an otherworldly blur as the reel spools to its doom. \n\nSounds of rushing feet. Smells of sterile floors. Touches from concerned staff. Tastes of my own bile and saliva. Too much. Too much...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe void. The same void I felt when that car hit; when I felt time freeze and a wall of eternity come crashing into my body to end my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sara.\" Mom's voice. I'd recognise it anywhere. The agony of sensation has gone away now, replaced by comfort. Her touch is warm and soft, her scent of lavender reminding me of childhood.

Rebuilding the dead one cell at a time, creating a whole new you. \n\nI remember it from my lectures on campus, how we could synthesise flesh, bone and sinew, how we could create hormones and enyzmes, how the impossible complexity of the brain - the essence of thought - was little more than nervous circuits and chemistry that could be replicated. \n\nI remember TBR not working, how all the dead came back as mere flesh, lacking the promethean spark of life. \n\nI remember the debates, the arguments on ethics, on the consequences of man playing God. Of how it proved the soul was divine that those who were rebuilt came back to life only in the functional, ugly sense. \n\nI'd always sworn that, once I'd finished med school, I'd sign a waiver that they couldn't do it to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Too much,\" I mutter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh, honey, we'd have paid all we had to have you back, whatever the risk.\" Mom's voice is soft, but not what I meant. I shake my head, sucking down more of the fluid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No,\" I say, untested muscles aching as I push my new mouth into a smile. \"I mean... get the doctor. Quick.\" She departs, and I suck on the straw again. It's all so obvious now; I know why TBR patients are simple, living corpses, with no apparent cognitive function. Multiple sets of footsteps; the doctor and his whole retinue. I wait until they come into the room and begins his spiel, but I wave him into silence. \"Listen, stop the TBRs,\" I gasp. \"I know why they don't work.\"\n\n\"Ms Daniels, why don't you just take it easy and...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"NO!\" I snap. \"Listen. Just... listen. The new bodies are overloading. The whole thing is new. New ears, new eyes, new lungs, new fucking nerve endings. When you snap 'em back, the TBR brains don't know how to handle it. Your brain throws sharp, loud, screaming input at you until it just shuts down. You're frying their minds with sensory overload. It's too much. You've got to... I don't know, put them in a womb environment or something. Dampen the noise. Or nobody's going to wake up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's silence. Silence followed by a rush of bodies, of interns heading to make desperate phonecalls. For the next hour, the doctors scramble to alert the world.

        "body": "1) Favourite country is either Japan or Taiwan. I really love Argentina, too. While I was there, I went around Cape Horn, which was incredible. As we were coming through the fog, we were told the story of the Flying Dutchman... and just then a ship started to appear! Fortunately it was the Chilean coast guard.

But with the technique being used at the moment (something called hot fusion) you also want a lot of extra neutrons. These neutrons are cast off during the fusion reaction, helping to stabilise the nucleus and preventing it from exploding.\n\nThere aren't many light elements that have loads of extra neutrons, but one that is easily available is calcium-48 (20 protons, 28 neutrons). This is also something called 'doubly magic', which is a big advantage. So, now you know you're using calcium (20 protons), you choose your target depending on what you want to make. For example, if you want tennessine (117), you need to shoot calcium into berkelium (element 97).\n\nWe can't use calcium to make elements beyond 118 because past element 98 there isn't enough material of any of the elements to make a viable target. So we're now using slightly different reactions.",

It took all of five seconds (Earth-time) for a throng to surround me. Soon, they were all at it. \"BOB! BOB! BOB!\"\n\nProblem: I am not Bob. Or Robert. Or Roberta. Or Bobbi. Or anything that could possibly be shortened to Bob.\n\nNow, translation services can get a little screwy on the far-moons. Sometimes what the aliens are actually saying has no relation to any Earth dialect, and so the service fills in the blanks. It's kind of how Google Translate used to occasionally mash things up back in the 21st century.\n\nSo when the aliens started screaming \"BOB! BOB! WE HAVE MISSED YOU!\" I had to assume it was an error. Peta-Epilson-4 was an out-there moon. I mean, look at the name: it's so out there we just gave it a designation. Predominant life were the Trufoids, who were a peaceable bunch and usually pretty friendly. But, then again, so were the 18th century Hawaiians and that didn't end up well for Captain Cook. When I'm out on a far-rim run, I usually try and keep my wits about me - even when I'm just looking for the local supply depot.\n\n\"Uh... I'm really sorry...\" I began. Explain I'm not 'Bob' and move on.\n\n\"Sorry! Damn right you should be sorry! We haven't seen your ass in what, five years?\" Again, the problem with translation services: it's hard to tell if an alien is being jocular or threatening. \n\n\"I'm not Bob,\" I said carefully. Clear. Simple. Direct.\n\n\"Oh Bob,\" the neutral tones of the translator relayed, \"you big kidder. So what you brought this time?\"\n\nThat answered whether they were friendly - and whether the translator worked. Unfortunately, that's when the sporelings arive. Trufoids tend to go through this phase that's basically a combination of a tentacle nightmare and silly putty, so it takes a while for the kids to do anything. Once they're upon you, though... boy, they're clingy.\n\n\"BOB! BAAAAAHHHHB!\" I could feel the cloying goop around my boots. Tugging. Pulling. Trying to get attention. \"What have you got for us? BOB!\"\n\nThis had gone on long enough. Now, protocols say you should never remove your filters, but in this instance what choice did I have? I gave a quick tug, ripping the tubes out of my nostrils, and simultaneously exclaiming \"I'm. Not. Bob!\" while wiggling my nose as the ticklish sensation.\n\n\"Oh. Wait... that's not Bob.\"\n\"Not Bob?\"\n\"Nah, it's just some other guy. Sorry, buddy.\"\n\nGradually, the crowd began to melt away, third tentacles all hanging low in deflated sadness. The sticky feeling around my feet subsided too; evidently if I hadn't brought anything to play with, the kids weren't sticking around.\n\nTurns out that the planet's ministerial census run used to be managed by a Robert Zemchuck before his wife hatched a storker and he had to head over to the Capsilion Cluster. Since then Peta-Epilson-4 had sort of fallen through the system and, being pretty far out, hadn't had a visit since.\n\n\"Sorry, man,\" as the attendant said while they topped up my fusion matter drives. \"But, y'know. Humans... you guys all look alike.\"",

        "body": "It did not take long for them to imprison me. I was in no state, weary as I felt the world and drunk from battle, to resist the seven or eight of them that quickly surrounded me. And yet, unlike the rest of the crew - who they had slaughtered to a man, I would later discover, the scent of blood from the mutiny drawing them as a lance draws the pus - they chose for me to live. I remember a sleigh sprinting atop snow with graceful ease, and a burning net cast over my body. I do not recall much more, for it was long ago and the bleakness of my predicament has blotted the inky stains of memory.\n\nI do remember the workshop, though, and the warm fire that removed some of the freeze from my flesh, and the feast of flesh they provided that made me gag and choke. It was not my crew, they pledged, though to this day I do not know if such is true; all I know is that they were committed to fattening me up, turning wasted muscle and gaunt cheeks into ruddy merriment.\n\nI do not know how long time passed. For I, it felt like an afternoon, and, truth be told, a pleasant one in which I drank and laughed with them, my captors and saviours in equal measure. My questions on their origins were rebuffed, and their countenance assured me that they were on the side of right - that they had dealt with the mutineers only. Though, of course, today I know the truth of it. And it would be a lie if I said I did not suspect it at the time. Then the leader, a wizened crone hunched over so that her tiny frame twisted her head almost to her knees, spoke in creaking tongue, bidding me to sit with her by the fire.\n\n\"We have a proposition for ye, Santa. Though it would vex us for you to say no, and we are not kin to be vexed.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" I asked. \"And why do you call me San...\"\n\n\"Santa. Servant. Claus. Of the kinfolk. That is you, and that is what you shall be the rest of your days.\"\n\n\"But I must return to England.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she clapped her hands at that. \"And ye shall, Santa Claus! Ye shall! For already they lay the lines of iron that bind my kin, twisted 'railways' that we cannot abide. Your folk shall call it science and progress, oblivious to the truth of it! For they are laying a maze that we cannot navigate! A prison on ancient lines that will forever banish us from their lands. In the past, we quarreled with your folk. Since your folk came into being, we have tried to speak with you, words of warmth and diplomacy. Yet you have taken our aid as malice and our gifts as cruelty unbound. Truly, we wish to put this aside. We have been pushed to the fringes of your world; to the edge of myth itself. Our last refuge are the cold lands of the North, and we need an emissary to bridge our worlds. That, Santa, shall be you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I confess, I had too many questions that I did no realise her lies. Diplomacy? Parlour tricks designed to vex and beguile. And Gifts? Only those as deadly as they could muster. Though not as deadly as the one I write to warn you of.\n\n\"I mean,\" the crone said, \"that once a year, for as many years as it takes, you shall deliver our presents into the world. And, through our presents, we shall bond ourselves in union with your kind.\"\n\nThe only bonds she truly meant were that of a slave. For their scheme was far darker than I could imagine. And even the blood of ancient Samhain will pallor compared with the carnage coming this eve, when they unleash their true \"gift\" upon you all.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not take long for them to imprison me. I was in no state, weary as I felt the world and drunk from battle, to resist the seven or eight of them that quickly surrounded me. And yet, unlike the rest of the crew - who they had slaughtered to a man, I would later discover, the scent of blood from the mutiny drawing them as a lance draws the pus - they chose for me to live. I remember a sleigh sprinting atop snow with graceful ease, and a burning net cast over my body. I do not recall much more, for it was long ago and the bleakness of my predicament has blotted the inky stains of memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do remember the workshop, though, and the warm fire that removed some of the freeze from my flesh, and the feast of flesh they provided that made me gag and choke. It was not my crew, they pledged, though to this day I do not know if such is true; all I know is that they were committed to fattening me up, turning wasted muscle and gaunt cheeks into ruddy merriment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know how long time passed. For I, it felt like an afternoon, and, truth be told, a pleasant one in which I drank and laughed with them, my captors and saviours in equal measure. My questions on their origins were rebuffed, and their countenance assured me that they were on the side of right - that they had dealt with the mutineers only. Though, of course, today I know the truth of it. And it would be a lie if I said I did not suspect it at the time. Then the leader, a wizened crone hunched over so that her tiny frame twisted her head almost to her knees, spoke in creaking tongue, bidding me to sit with her by the fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have a proposition for ye, Santa. Though it would vex us for you to say no, and we are not kin to be vexed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what is that?&amp;quot; I asked. &amp;quot;And why do you call me San...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Santa. Servant. Claus. Of the kinfolk. That is you, and that is what you shall be the rest of your days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I must return to England.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot; she clapped her hands at that. &amp;quot;And ye shall, Santa Claus! Ye shall! For already they lay the lines of iron that bind my kin, twisted &amp;#39;railways&amp;#39; that we cannot abide. Your folk shall call it science and progress, oblivious to the truth of it! For they are laying a maze that we cannot navigate! A prison on ancient lines that will forever banish us from their lands. In the past, we quarreled with your folk. Since your folk came into being, we have tried to speak with you, words of warmth and diplomacy. Yet you have taken our aid as malice and our gifts as cruelty unbound. Truly, we wish to put this aside. We have been pushed to the fringes of your world; to the edge of myth itself. Our last refuge are the cold lands of the North, and we need an emissary to bridge our worlds. That, Santa, shall be you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; I confess, I had too many questions that I did no realise her lies. Diplomacy? Parlour tricks designed to vex and beguile. And Gifts? Only those as deadly as they could muster. Though not as deadly as the one I write to warn you of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I mean,&amp;quot; the crone said, &amp;quot;that once a year, for as many years as it takes, you shall deliver our presents into the world. And, through our presents, we shall bond ourselves in union with your kind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only bonds she truly meant were that of a slave. For their scheme was far darker than I could imagine. And even the blood of ancient Samhain will pallor compared with the carnage coming this eve, when they unleash their true &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; upon you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "\"Halt right there! Arms where I can see 'em!\"\n\"Hands up!\"\n\"Droppit, droppit, droppit!\"\n\nThe barked orders were overwhelming, coming from all directions as armed figures, swaddled in protective vests and desert fatigues, leveled guns, tasers, even an RPG in my direction. It was too much. For a moment I couldn't help but cower, collapsing onto the ground, the pit of my stomach slowly twisting with a chill mix of fear and panic. In that moment I was back in my bedroom again, back when I was in my early teens and mom's footsteps came up the stairs just as I was having an illicit smoke out of the window. Only mom, for all her bark, didn't have several rounds of high-penetration rounds ready to pump into my torso.\n\n\"Shut up, you idiots.\" The voice was cool and calm among the barked commands. Guards bark to confuse you - I've seen them do it, from my silent hideaway in their midst - and I'd always felt a sense of smug satisfaction knowing this. When they're barking at you, it's an entirely different matter. Especially when some smartass points out...\n\n\"Rogerson. Be quiet. How do you even know if his hands *are* up? You can't see him. Or her. Or it. And Pho, what is he-slash-she-slash-it gonna drop? Do you think they're carrying something?\"\n\nIt was this level voice, female register, commanding and ordered, that reminded me that I was still cloaked. Cloaked, by the way, is what I call invisibility. Because it's far geekier, and it gives it a sense of style. The invisible guy pervs on girls in the shower room like a creep; the cloaked guy uses his powers responsibly. (Not that I always have, I should stress, but so far I haven't stooped low enough to violate someone's privacy.)\n\nAt the voice, the panic faded, and I began to uncurl myself from the foetal position I'd adopted on the floor. I'd been some crazy places in the past - walking into the oval office once, and into more concerts, nightclubs and high roller bars than you could imagine with impunity - but Area 51 had always felt the ultimate. Aliens! UFOs! Military secrets! What a rush. Until, of course, this.\n\n\"You.\" The woman - a major, by the look of it - stared right at me. \"You human? You able to show yourself?\"\n\nI closed my eyes and willed it so. The cloak vanished, revealing my skinny-ass form, still in a T-shirt and jeans. I'd learned that the cloak affected things I touched almost immediately, so fortunately I didn't have to hide my modesty from a bunch of grunts. \n\nTwo of them burst out laughing at the sight of a teenage punk on the floor, wincing at the potential avalanche of bullets headed my way. None of them took their guns off me. I swallowed.\n\n\"I was just looking around...\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, take a good look, because you're going to spend the next 20 years in a supermax if you... are you even old enough to be charged as an adult? Jesus. Someone cuff him.\"\n\nI took a breath, and, slowly, twisted my way up to the side of the wall. Without a word, two of the guards hauled me up and slapped cuffs on me, twisting my arms awkwardly behind my back. The major continued.\n\n\"Who are you?\" \n\nI just shook my head. I was in enough trouble and, madly, I still figured I could get my way out of it. Just needed a break to slip the cloak back on, once I worked out how they'd seen me. \n\n\"No name, huh? Well, I'm gonna have to call you something. Let's go with Muddy.\"\n\nI paused, and looked her dead in the eye in confusion. \"Why Muddy?\" I couldn't help it, it just tumbled out.\n\nShe laughed, and gestured down the corridor. \"Because you might be invisible - and believe me, we're gonna be talking about that *a lot* - but your footprints aren't. You dragged half the Groom Lake Salt Flat down my polished halls. It's like frickin' Blues Clues in here.\"\n\nI turned back. Sure enough, brown-white stains lined the corridor. I closed my eyes. \"Dammit.\"\n\nThere was a laugh. \"C'mon, master thief. Let's you and I have a little chat. And maybe we can work something out...\"\n",

Thirty seconds to bash out the label, thirty seconds to get the box (assuming it's prescribed in the right amount that actually comes in a single box) and then a minute to make sure someone's done a final eyeball and that it's all accurate.\n\nThe rest is going through patient records to make sure that your record is updated and not the person with the same name who lives two streets away, checking that the doctor has written the prescription correctly (about 1/10 prescriptions have an error on them), checking that the prescription is not a) wrong and going to kill you; b) dangerous because of something else you're taking and therefore going to kill you; or c) because it's goddamn illegal and if I fill it then I'll end up in jail.\n\nRemember where I said one item? Usually it's 3-4 items for regulars, and usually they've all got these wonderful things called interactions. Keep in mind a pharmacy can easily do 500+ items a day.\n\nThen there's that final check. That's to make sure that the assistant or tech who got the box out didn't get the wrong similarly designed box, or the wrong similarly named medicine. For example, you know the difference between ergometrine and ergotamine? Could you spot that after the 200th item? *Whole video games* are designed on peoples' ability to struggle with that. This is like *Papers Please* only if you get it wrong, someone dies. And wrong could be a name, a quantity, a missing little thing, a dose, or just not knowing something about a medicine. Oh, the fuck we had when someone put methotrexate through the pill counter.\n\nOh yeah! Remember when I said that assuming things would come in the right boxes? Most boxes comes in 28s. That's lovely if you have a prescription that lasts four weeks (one a day) or a medicine that is taken BD or QDS (two or four times a day). But what about those three times a day bastards? Do you think the doctors remember that? Do they fuck. So the pharmacist has to split the packs. So that takes time because, again, gotta count 'em all.\n\nAnd what if it's a kiddy medicine? Let's say it's antibiotics. That means making up the suspension in the pharmacy (those bottles of bright yellow crap come in powdered form). So someone has to pour out the *exact* amount, and that has to be double-checked by someone, and then you have to shake it. Then you've got to find the mouth syringe. And while you're doing all that, chances are Mr Drug Addict has come for his methadone, which means going into the safe, and measuring that out, and also logging *every damn ml* of the stuff to prove you're not a budding Walter White.\n\nStill not finished, because then we need to get a PIL. That's the little leaflet that comes in the box, that some ass has removed and thrown away. So we have to print a new one.\n\nAnd after all that the answer is that it fucking doesn't take the average pharmacy 30 minutes to fill a prescription, stop being a hyperbolic donkeybollock.\n",

London is a hard place at times, but Michael Bond&amp;#39;s creation reminds you that it can be all rather decent, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus I found Hugh Grant dressed as a nun strangely attractive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The first machines, those of the early pioneers, rattled along with little more than bolts and braces - a constant racket of creaking canvas and shaking metal. That gave way to the hot puffs and gargles of engines. Later, the soaring crescendo of jet engines as they reached their maximum, hurling huge hulks into the sky. \n\nBut for a time, before it all became ready meals, no leg room and those hinkey screens, flight was beautiful. Serene, almost. I remember the first time I took my kite into the sky and let its engine cut. Nothing but the whistle of air and the cool breeze on your face. Then, up in a heaven of golden sunlight and blue skies, you'd start her up again and drift elegantly over a carpet of endless white. Hot damn, it was something special. Cold as all Henry - something that made you huddle up in your jacket - but even so, the kind of feeling all pilots yearn for. You flew like a bird, up there alone.\n\nWe were cruising like that just after dawn, trying to hold her up even though we were flying on vapors. Howland was nowhere to be seen, and all we had below was pure, endless blue ocean. Funny thing, flying over the Pacific - the dawn snaps like turning on a light switch, so one moment it's pitch dark, the next you're dazzled by total light. Fred tried to get a fix but we couldn't find the darn strip, so instead just cruised up and down, North and South, looking for smoke signals on the horizon. I don't think we ever thought we wouldn't make it. I don't think we ever felt alone.\n\nAnd then Fred looks out the window, and says \"Would you look at that.\" So I follow his finger, and there it is - a stream of planes up in the sky. All flying in formation, all flying the same direction. We hadn't seen anything like half of 'em. They were crates that shouldn't have made 200 feet, biplanes, fighters, sleek looking metal birds and giant behemoths like something Mr Howard Hughes was always babbling about trying to get up. One of the kites even looked like Nungesser and Coli.\n\n\"Well, not like we have much choice,\" says Fred, and I agree. So I point us up, and we slip into the formation. And then the strangest thing. The engine just stopped out of juice, but we kept on up there. We weren't gliding - the rotor kept turning - but the engine noise faded away.  Gradually, I took my hand off the controls and just let her ease into line with the rest of 'em, and along we flew - in clear sky and easy weather. We started to recognise them all. Came to know them all. Came to know where we were flying toward. It was freedom.\n\nAnd everything felt beautiful.",

It’s not perfect (I’ve been to about 40 or so countries but have never been to South America, while a friend I know has been to all 50 US states but technically only 1 country), but it gives a rough sense of interest in travel. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And we couldn't tell him, it had to be his doctor, so the tech just said 'Well, the doctor will talk to you about your results'. And as he walked out we both knew he would be dead in months.\n\nThe second that sticks in my mind was... there's a strange thing that happens in elderly wards. And this was an elderly rehab ward, for people recovering after breaking hips etc. If a person leaves, or dies, then often the person in the next bed dies too. It's like... permission.

And I'm a massive Hunter dork.\n\nIf she has Batman-levels of chemistry, then she'll know the key thing she needs is gas-chromotography--mass spectrometry, which handily is a machine called a GC-MS. If she has resources (or allies in science) she could probably get access to one to run the test. \n\n[Here's all you need.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry)\n\nIn terms of manufacture, once you have a structure you can work back. There are various ways to synthesise drugs, but essentially we're assuming that your Batman has the broad knowledge of organic chemistry (which, confusingly, isn't to do with organisms, it just basically means stuff around carbon atoms) to know some of the famous step reactions, and can therefore work back the synthesis. If you want, say she does an in character literature search and pulls up a paper on novel synthesis steps from Dr X and Dr X, who happens to be based at the university, or Dr X from X company. \n\nBonus points: Phil Baran at Scripps in the US is currently a master of one-pot synthesis (basically reducing the number of steps and chemicals you need drastically), and is considered the leading authority on this work.

And I&amp;#39;m a massive Hunter dork.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she has Batman-levels of chemistry, then she&amp;#39;ll know the key thing she needs is gas-chromotography--mass spectrometry, which handily is a machine called a GC-MS. If she has resources (or allies in science) she could probably get access to one to run the test. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s all you need.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of manufacture, once you have a structure you can work back. There are various ways to synthesise drugs, but essentially we&amp;#39;re assuming that your Batman has the broad knowledge of organic chemistry (which, confusingly, isn&amp;#39;t to do with organisms, it just basically means stuff around carbon atoms) to know some of the famous step reactions, and can therefore work back the synthesis. If you want, say she does an in character literature search and pulls up a paper on novel synthesis steps from Dr X and Dr X, who happens to be based at the university, or Dr X from X company. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bonus points: Phil Baran at Scripps in the US is currently a master of one-pot synthesis (basically reducing the number of steps and chemicals you need drastically), and is considered the leading authority on this work. So you could talk a little about this to make the fluff feel more real. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And the craftsmen used to be so dirt poor they'd take anything for a quick helping hand in the shop. \n\nThat was good work for sprites. Good, honest work that carried respectability. And if the stupid human eventually thought too much of themselves and stopped leaving the customary food offerings, well, what was given could be taken away just as sharpish. A few businesses close down and your realise you're not supposed to mess with us. We assist, but we can take away. Don't think of it as a protection racket: just think of it as a provider of services. Hob-nail boots, if you will.\n\nTimes change, though. Started with the coming of steel. A few humans thought they were too good for a sprite's shoemanship and tried to mechanise, but we could sabotage that pretty easily. Steel, though... well. You know fairies can't cross steel? All those railroads started penning the fair folk in, trapping them in their glades and tooth fortresses. And things got harder from there.\n\nWithin a decade, the magical shoe repair racket was in trouble. Shoes started being made in factories, on belts with moving parts, where a sprite - no matter how fast they could work - would invariably find themselves churned into pixie jam by the cogs. Just wasn't worth it, either; the owners didn't really notice or care about a few extra pairs of shoes, and treated their humans even worse than we did if they got on our wrong side. Terrible, really. A hundred years later, and the industry was as good as dead.\n\nCourse, the good news is that nowadays things have changed. A new breed of human - the hipster - has emerged. They talk about boutique shoes, of craftsmanship with soul (yeah, terrible pun, but that's what those hipsters love). We thought that the industry had returned, that old skills were being rekindled. The rackets started up again. A hipster would go upstairs one night, and down in the morning they'd find a new pair of shoes. A lot of 'em were willing to embrace traditions (in a post-modern, ironic way), which meant they honoured the hard-working sprite again. Food was back on the family's plate, and no mistake.\n\nBut it didn't last. For starters, even though our skills were rusty after 100 years, they were a bit...well. Too good. The hipsters who didn't use the mass-produced lines didn't want quality apparel, they wanted 'shabby chic'. They wanted a little bit of fraying, they wanted 'perfect imperfections' and 'blemishes to show it was an ethically sourced, hand-crafted product'. Ethically sourced? They were getting something for barely nothing off the hard-working cobbler sprite. We might have been on our knees, but our self-respect wasn't for sale. If they wanted to put badly made merchandise on Etsy and claim it was 'nearly new' or 'vintage', they could do it without us.\n\nAnd, to be honest, that was the other problem. There isn't much a sprite requires to knock up a few high-quality shoes, but a bit of darkness and quiet is essential. Quirky lightbulbs blazing all night raises the possibility of being caught. But peace? With hipsters? HA. Those 1940s-sock-hop-loving, moustache-waxed muppets love only one thing more than their feigned love of craftsmanship: coffee. They're AeroPress cafetiere junkies, clicking and clacking away into the wee hours, high on their bean buzz. You set a schedule to do your work at, say, 2am, and suddenly one of them appears, messing up your workspace in a moment of micro-gentrification.\n\nSo no, thank you. Not anymore. The days of the sprite cobbler are over. The machines... they were bad. But the hipsters? They're worse.",

We believe there are islands that are stable - we just need to get an isotope that is on them. We&amp;#39;re pretty sure there is an island of stability around element 114, flerovium. The problem is that we don&amp;#39;t have a beam that has enough neutrons to create an isotope that sits on the island. If we did, we&amp;#39;d have a variant of flerovium that would last for centuries instead of seconds. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Normally I don't really care about being overweight as I have zero personal relationships that it impacts and it doesn't affect my mobility. However, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do something that I thought was out of reach.\n\nAt school, I was taught that I was worthless when it came to sports. At the start of my first year - on my first day - the teachers picked the kids that would be 'the team' and the rest of us were totally ignored for the next seven years. We were made to know just how little our value was other than to gather balls, sit and watch, or kick around aimlessly in the poor quality sports field. Basically if you didn't have any natural aptitude (or you were an attractive girl) the PE teachers didn't care. So I never did any sports, or had any interest in sports. \n\nThen one day I was at a convention that was going on at the same time as the London Marathon, and said to a friend that I'd spent way too much money, and the next year I'd run the marathon so I wouldn't have to waste my money at the con. That night I signed up, didn't think much about it, soon forgot I had.\n\nUntil I was accepted. I did a couch-to-5k running plan to get into reasonable shape, then a 16 week running regimen. In the end I managed to get around in a time that I considered reasonable. It was pretty amazing (it was the week after what happened in Boston, so there was a certain poignancy), an unforgettable experience, and proof that if you REALLY want to you can pull of most human endeavours that you think are out of reach.\n\nToday I'm still a fat slob but I do bike 18 miles every day and bench something that I'm personally pretty happy with.",

However, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do something that I thought was out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At school, I was taught that I was worthless when it came to sports. At the start of my first year - on my first day - the teachers picked the kids that would be &amp;#39;the team&amp;#39; and the rest of us were totally ignored for the next seven years. We were made to know just how little our value was other than to gather balls, sit and watch, or kick around aimlessly in the poor quality sports field. Basically if you didn&amp;#39;t have any natural aptitude (or you were an attractive girl) the PE teachers didn&amp;#39;t care. So I never did any sports, or had any interest in sports. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day I was at a convention that was going on at the same time as the London Marathon, and said to a friend that I&amp;#39;d spent way too much money, and the next year I&amp;#39;d run the marathon so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to waste my money at the con. That night I signed up, didn&amp;#39;t think much about it, soon forgot I had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until I was accepted. I did a couch-to-5k running plan to get into reasonable shape, then a 16 week running regimen. In the end I managed to get around in a time that I considered reasonable. It was pretty amazing (it was the week after what happened in Boston, so there was a certain poignancy), an unforgettable experience, and proof that if you REALLY want to you can pull of most human endeavours that you think are out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m still a fat slob but I do bike 18 miles every day and bench something that I&amp;#39;m personally pretty happy with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Skirmishes with the resistance had pretty much stopped about a month earlier, when the US realised that their staple diet of fast food and fads had rendered them into a population easily quashed by anyone who could rely on foot power, pedal power or general cardio. Even their own propaganda had told them that they needed cardio - it was one of Jesse Eisenberg's rules. Why did nobody ever listen to Eisenberg?\n\nAnyway, the patrol had started off pretty standard, the APC rumbling along as you'd expect. That's when things started to get hot. Really hot. Heat of a thousand suns hot. At first, we thought it was a broken AC, but once the metal started glowing on the interior, we knew we had to get out. And that's when the carnage started.\n\nExplosions. Everywhere. Front and behind. Disorientation. Almost immediately we started hitting the deck, numerous Rube Goldberg machines taking us down in the strangest ways you can imagine. In front, a guy I vaguely recognised as one of their fast food propagandists rushed forward, deploying robots and laughing manically. It was suicide, but I guess he felt guilty about taking the corporate dollar. He only made 10 feet before someone hit him and he went down.\n\nAbove, somewhere, there was maniacal cackling, a high-pitched squeal of delight that 'Finally! We got the Archimedes Death Ray to work!' I couldn't see who was shouting - some kind of mirror device dazed and dazzled - but I could see from the shadow he was prancing around like a death pixie, delirious in his victory, excited by all that went and would go boom.\n\nBack at street level we were trying to gather ourselves into a kind of resistance. The other two on the ground - a guy who belonged in a 90s surf punk video and a girl with a penchant for fire - were squabbling with each other, which gave us a lull in the fighting. We thought for a moment we'd turn it around...\n\nAnd that's when we saw him. Emerging out of the smoke like an avenging angel. He didn't wear armour. He didn't need to. He didn't shout, or yell, or exalt some kind of battle cry. He merely blew out a lip concealed by a walrus moustache and grumbled, a guttural smack of tired distemper, as if he *were sick of these damn kids and their invasion*. With cold, dead eyes under a beret that seemed to hover over his skull like a halo, he walked forward, drill in hand.\n\n'Guess I'm going to have to do this,' he muttered. \n\nFive minutes later everyone else was dead, and I was strapped to the front of the APC, the laughing blonde maniac cracking jokes and trying to lift my spirits as they left me as a message for my superiors. Next to me, seared into the still-hot metal, the charred scar of their 'death ray' had cut out a simple message.\n\nPLAUSIBLE.",

It was the same light popcorn fluff as other movies coming out at that time, skewing toward teen males. It succeeded largely because the other movies of that time failed so miserably (*Batman and Robin*). But the superhero genre failed to innovate for almost ten years, recycling similar arcs and stylistic choices. Some were successful (*Spiderman*), some were not (*Daredevil*). But that poster could have been for anything from then - it would have worked for *Fantastic Four*.\n\nThanks to the MCU, the Nolan Batman series and, to an extent, the failure of the DCU, Hollywood has finally worked out what fans resonate with when it comes to these iconic characters. There's nothing wrong with movies for kids, but the stylistic choices reflect a greater comfort with characters brought on by box office success, and a willingness to experiment.\n\nIt's not all original (hey, this is Hollywood) - Logan is basically a Western.

HMS Tamar was the Navy's base, and the pool there was basically occupied by kids during the long, hot summer, with the adults hanging around at the pool's edge. I was nuts about going underwater, so used to swim down at the bottom - something most people never did. \n\nAnyway, I was swimming along the bottom and suddenly I come across the prone body of this kid called Gareth. I knew his brother, and, thinking he was doing some early 90s version of planking, sunk down and lay next to him on the pool floor. I totally expected him to hit me - but he didn't. He just lay there. So I poked him. Still lay there. Shook him. Still lay there.\n\nAt this point I realised what was going on, and grabbed him and hauled him out of the water, yelling for help. The pool was full of people, but for some reason most of them hadn't seen the kid. The lifeguard on duty had dived in, and grabbed him from me as I hauled him out. So there I am, a 10-year-old, watching as a lifeguard takes this kid and puts him on the side of the pool, giving him full CPR. The kid splutters to life, off he goes to the hospital, and the whole pool is shocked. It later emerged that he'd been running along the side of the pool and slipped in, knocking himself out.\n\nSo we're all sitting there, and I'm sat next to this kid called Aaron. And I start telling him what happened, and he insists no, he was the one who got help. He saw the kid, got the lifeguard. And I'm thinking 'this is crap'. Then the adults start lecturing us on how Aaron had been so brave and heroic, and how he was a hero that had saved Gareth's life. And I'm sat there thinking 'what the hell? I just pulled that kid out of the water!'\n\nWhat had happened, of course, is that we'd *both* acted. Aaron had been on the side and seen Gareth through the water, and told the lifeguard. Simultaneously, I'd started hauling Gareth out of the water, handing him off to the lifeguard.\n\nAaron got a bike as a reward and grateful thanks from parents. I got called a liar at school. It's one of those weird memories where everything about it is miserable, but I'm still glad I did it.",

The very action of time travel - placing yourself in another time, one where you do not belong, results in a change in events that mean the future is modified in some way. Thus time travel becomes a perceptual loop of little alterations, some of which throw off the wheels of progress, some make things a little smoother. Think of it like calibrating a bike.\n\nThe best way to conceptualise this is to imagine a world in two dimensions being viewed by you, a being in three dimensions. A flat world, with flat people, only you reach down and pull one up into the sky. How does this 2D being explain what has just happened? They lack the verbal gymnastics required to reveal something beyond their world view. And if that analogy works for you, it's probably because I ripped it from Carl Sagan.\n\nThe reason I mention all of this is because how time travel is possible, or why it has ripples invisible and incorporeal, is beyond our understanding. We just know that we can do it. And we know that, when these ripples build up substantially, the universe itself begins to fight against itself.\n\nFortunately, there is a release switch to this pressure. The universe simply needs a little nudge - that bike calibration - to feel like it's in control again. This sometimes results in deja vu, sometimes the genetic lottery spitting out two near-identical people in different parts of the world, and sometimes through an explosion of thoughts, concepts from ideas from times beyond that coalesce and condense into genius, inspiration and miraculous acts. All of this is the natural switch. Yet sometimes we have to step in to help.\n\nReddit, we soon discovered, was the perfect 21st century switch. Much like 'zines of the 20th century, penny dreadfuls of the 19th, scrawled lewd graffiti in Ancient Rome or the yogurt pot codes of Neo-Brazil. If you type some junk and jive on Reddit - some wild and mad conspiracy theory that something 'could' happen - the universe accepts that this probability was likely enough that it's part of the natural order. Thus we, the society of the future, put all the crazy repercussions of our actions on Reddit. We post pictures of insane acts, confident someone will belittle them as 'FAKE' or 'THIS DID NOT HAPPEN'. We spout theories about inventions. We unwind the creative spool of 'dank memes'. And the universe, safe in its natural order, accepts this as part of the coherent timeline and reality.\n\nThus, when one Traveller happened to attend Donald Trump's inauguration, spilled his coffee and caused a pigeon to fly out, we knew we had to take action. Not because of the pigeon itself, but the Rube Goldberg events that unfolded after: the coffee to the pigeon, the pigeon catching the attention of a bald eagle brought along as part of the celebrations, the eagle flying after the pigeon, the secret service mistaking the eagle for a drone and shooting it dead, the dead eagle tumbling to the ground and whacking the president-elect over the head as he took his oath, the world viewing this as a sign of the collapsing democracy of the Union and all that followed... well. We had to take action.\n\nIt was fortunate I could remember my Reddit account back in 2013. All it took was a simple trip back to boot up my old computer (booting! How quaint), a few typed (typed!) strokes onto a website... and instantly the universe was comfortable with the reality.\n\n\"LOL, IMAGINE IF TEH DUDE FROM THE APPRENTICE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT.

        "body": "A surprising amount occurred in science, even nuclear research and physical/chemical discovery. While the Communist bloc countries had their own version of Western academic facilities (for example, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna was built as a rough equivalent to CERN), there was a surprising amount of interaction. For example, members of US privately owned universities did travel to the USSR for academic summits, and technological ideas were shared at conferences and through academic papers. There were also more regulated visits between major institutions: Albert Ghiorso and Glenn Seaborg, who were running experiments on transfermium element discovery at Berkeley, visited their Russian counterparts (Flerov and Oganessian) in the 70s.

The Inquisitor's grim countenance did not break into a smile, merely curled with further contempt. The Cadians, Mordians and even Valhallans all waited to eviscerate the xenotide.\n\n\"But I'm a toy. We are all toys,\" Buzz protested.\n\n\"You mean puppets of chaos. We are not toys, but men, chosen of the Emperor. You, behemoth, reek of the taint of the Warp.\"\n\n\"The Warp?\"\n\n\"The passage that lies beyond. Once the warp was safe, but we have seen the corrupt savages that return hence. Behold the filth that must be purged.\"\n\nThe Inquisitor pointed over to a shelf, somewhere out of the way. Buzz turned his head, eyes widening at the horrors that existed. Melted plastics, badly combined sprues of limbs, and models slathered with glue, details obliterated in oozing resin. A few even had the worst crime of all: multiple thick layers of black undercoat, with crude red, yellow and orange flames blotted on to their armour by someone who didn't know how to wash a brush.\n\n\"Once, this was a pure land,\" the Inquisitor continued. \"We, the originals, handed down from the father, the Emperor. Only now the taint of chaos infests. The spawn of Horus, the infernalist Jimmy, feeds the vile Tyranids with his monstrous presence.\"\n\n\"But...they're just toys, like you! They're just badly painted! Jimmy's done this, not them! Not me!\"\n\n\"SILENCE!\" The Inquisitor howled. \"Lest you end up like the remnants of the Hive World 'Warhammer', whose paltry forces of primitive Eldar were sacrificed by Jimmy to the vile chaos God 'Eebaay' when the lies of the 'Age of Sigmar' commenced.\"\n\nBehind the Inquisitor, Buzz saw tanks rumbling forward. He held his hand up, muttering about coming in peace. But they didn't seem to buy it. They didn't seem to understand. It was almost as bad as his own delusions. Or the delusions of the Other Buzz in that Supermarket. Or the delusions he'd had in the nursery, as his button had been reset. The Inquisitor seemed to believe everything he said.\n\n\"Prepare the dip,\" the Inquisitor commanded. At once, a skull-faced assassin appeared, popping open a pot of something called 'Badab Black'. Buzz didn't like the sound of...\n\nThe door swung open and Jimmy walked in. At once, Buzz collapsed. The soldiers, still in their combat-ready poses, froze, guns still trained on him. If he weren't plastic, he would have felt a bead of sweat drip.\n\n\"Buzz Lightyear. Laaaaaame,\" Jimmy said, gripping Buzz and positioning him, fists rigid. \"You're what, 20 years old? Still, I got a use for you.\"\n\nBuzz felt himself cast down onto the bed, Jimmy collapsing down and firing up his console, blasting opponents into oblivion with insults about their mother, munching cheese-based snacks and slurping colas. To Buzz it felt like a lifetime - a torment of waiting to see what would happen. Then Jimmy grasped him again, taking him over to the paint station.\n\n\"So, what am I going to do with you?\" he asked, pulling out a screwdriver and pair of pliers. \"Hmm... GOT IT! I'm going to convert you into an Ork Mecka. Take your head off, add some lascannons and meltas, give you a paint job... yeah. The Ork Boyz are going to love it. You're going to be the centrepiece of my new converted army.\"\n\nBuzz felt the screw in his back loosening, and gazed up into those callous teen eyes. He was beginning to wonder if the fate the Inquisitor offered him wouldn't have been preferable after all... \n\nEdit: Fixed the spelling of Orc to Ork.",

I think he utters maybe three lines the whole time; it's mostly grunts and groans as plan after ingenious plan works or fails. But it's amazing how much I was invested.

The statue atop the cairn kept its impassive glare, a sentinel gazing out at the wide skies and snow-scattered fells of the inhospitable land.\n\n\"Must we meet here? It's *far* too chilly. Not to mention cliche.\" Sanguine was already stretched out on the only fur rug, slowly rubbing a rose-tipped staff against a scratch, wondering if his louche pose had put him a little too close to Peyrite. \n\n\"Seems cosy to me,\" Malacath retorted, as a reed-slip figure slithered from the shadows behind. \n\n\"Personally I'd have preferred to meet at night.\" \n\n\"And that is not for you to decide, Nocturne. We all have a claim to this one.\" As always, Azura was right. That's why nobody liked Azura. Azura was always right. \"And, given that my *gift* to this one was to hold souls...\"\n\n\"Then you've had enough fun. Your claim is void.\" Clavicus Vile grinned, petting his loyal toy, sat at his side. \"Isn't that right, Hermy?\"\n\nA shapeless voice sighed in the air. \"Indeed. As is Hircine's. The hunt is over.\n\n\"You just want her for yourself,\" Mephala laughed. \"We decided not to listen to you before this meeting.\"\n\n\"We?\" Hermaeus Mora said, irritated, the hollow, echoing cry resounding around the cairn, fuming there was something it did not know. Mephala continued.\n\n\"Boethiah, Nocturnal and I. I'm surprised Vaermina didn't warn you about it.\"\n\n\"Enough bickering!\" A warrior stood up, pulling a weapon. \"He's mine, and I'll smash anyone who denies it.\"\n\n\"Oh really? COME AT ME, BROTHER!\" Mehrunes Dagon rose, squaring up to Molag Bal's claims of enslavement.\n\n\"Oh, don't be so boreish,\" Sanguine yawned, momentarily distracted from some activity behind him. The other princes frowned, only now noticing that Namira had slithered up beside the prince, and was no doubt teaching Hermaeus Mora something new.\n\n\"Indeed,\" Azura said, bringing the matter to the task at hand. \"This is getting us nowhere. If we do not decide, *it* will. Or *Him*.\"\n\n\"It? And who's *it*?\" Mephala was having fun again.\n\n\"Sithis,\" the figureless voice said. \"Or Talos. Indeed, she already visited Sovngarde.\"\n\nThat's when a laugh shut them all up. A laugh that could belong to only one figure. \"Oh, look at you all arguing and blathering away, fiddle-de-de-fiddle-de-do.  Sanguine's right, for once in his debauched life. So boring, I'm inclined to give you a hit of the wabberjack.\"\n\nThe others backed away. Even Mehrunes Dagon seemed concerned. Bloodbaths were his business, but if he knew one thing, it was that you didn't mess with crazy.\n\n\"Now, you're all forgetting one thing,\" the Lord of Madness continued. \"And that's *order*. Oh, I know, who am I to be jibbering about that? Hmm? HAHAHA! Well,  without a little chaos now and then, you get... you get you-know-who. You want him back? You want Jyggalag? I don't! No no no, not now, not ever, keep it out of my realm, thank you kindly! So that means you can all keep your hands, horns, claws, fingers, tentacles and gaseous tendrils away from her! Because otherwise we're going to have Mr Buzzkill back in the realms.\"\n\nAzura stiffened. \"What do you propose?\"\n\n\"Propose?\" Sheogorath cackled. \"Already did!\"\n\n...\n\nAway from the cairn, away from it all, the future Dragonborn was shaken awake, slowly coming to, the chill mist hanging in the air, the creaking rhythms of the cart resounding in his or her ear. They recognised, vaguely, the stormcloak in front. Recognised, vaguely, the fated horse thief and the mouth-bound Jarl. Recognised, though everything was different. Everything was a little sharper, a little crisper, a little deeper in colour. Gone were the personal touches that had once filled the world, absent the jokes and the unbridled creativity. Tamriel felt reborn and repurposed once again.\n\nSlowly, Helgen's walls began to loom through the fog, and the wagon turned down on its fated path once more. \n\n\"We start again,\" Sheogorath explained, a voice too distant to be heard. \"I call it the Remastered Edition.\"",

Just going to slip out the Apple Mac and make like Jeff Goldblum, huh?\"\n\nI turned to look at him. \"Are you going to help or not?\"\n\nJack gave his serious look - or as close to serious as that face ever could manage - then crossed his eyes, as if someone had slapped him on the face. \"EERrrrrrrr....NOT!\"\n\nI paused, closed the laptop - why the damn aliens hadn't taken it off me I had no idea - and stared back at him with incredulity.\n\n\"Why not? We're both prisoner...\"\n\n\"No-charoney, cabroney. I am not a prisoner of these inter-dimensional beings. And aliens is just a touch racist, you know?\"\n\n\"What? Why the hell are you here?\"\n\n\"Why?\" Jack leapt up, somehow going into a star jump. \"Because it's friggin' awesome! Look around you! It's a shiny fest of amazing futurology.\"\n\n\"That's...That's not what futurology means! I...\" I paused. Caught my breath, slumped down the metal sides of the ship. I assume they were metal - I just wasn't willing to ask him in case he did an impromptu air guitar solo and rock horns. Instead, I summoned up the Zen tranquility I could only find when Pauly Shore movies forced me to blot out existence beyond my own thoughts. \n\nStatus check. I'm alive. On a space ship of some kind, that's clear. With Jack Black, for some reason. Still fully dressed, which bodes well. Still with my laptop. I opened it up, Jack collapsing down next to me like we were bros that had just tucked into the sweetest of burritos together. \n\nI prayed for the Zen peaks of *Bio Dome* to forget that I'd used the term 'bro'. \n\n\"So, you a fan of my movies?\"\n\n\"I liked *Mars Attacks!*.\"\n\n\"What? Pft. I mean, I get it, it's fitting, but I died as soon as the aliens landed. OMG, SPOILER! I meant the classics. *Gulliver's Travels*. *Shallow Hal*. *Tropic Thunder*. Yeah, I was in that,\" he over-emphasised the word, screwing his finger into the floor, \"though everyone only remembers RDJ.\"\n\nThere was a reason for that. I opened up the laptop again.\n\n\"*High Fidelity*. That was OK. *School of...*\" I caught myself before I said it. Too late.\n\n\"Roooooooooooooooooooooooocccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkk.\"\n\nI groaned. \"Look, you might be OK up here, but I'm not. I want to get out. And... wait.\"\n\n\"What?\" Suddenly he was leaning over. \"What is it, bro? Discovered something critical? Something important?\"\n\n\"WHY DO ALIENS HAVE WI-FI?\"\n\n\"I told you. Not aliens.

Black looked sheepish.\n\n\"Where am I, Jack?\"\n\n\"Inter-dimensional...\"\n\n\"Where. Am. I. Jack.\"\n\n\"I get lonely...\"\n\n\"WHERE AM I JACK?\"\n\n\"Fine. You're in my basement. I just like space ships, and wanted to hang with someone. I totally didn't kidnap you or anything. Ha! That would be ridiculous! Like, you know. I wouldn't do that. Like how I wouldn't pretend to be a teacher to a bunch of kids I didn't know, or commit serial murders and get my town to cover it up, or - ha ha ha - how I convinced a life coach to hypnotise me to see fat chicks as hot women.\"\n\nI swallowed, and stared into those maniacal eyes, recounting his movies one by one. I hated myself that I even got the references. Reality was once again infringing on my zen.\n\n\"Can... can I go?\"\n\nHe hung his head sadly. \"'Fraid not.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well... this may not be a space ship, but the inter-dimensional beings, they're real. And they have instructions.\" He rose, and walked back, a crazed smile widening below those crazed eyes. My throat tightened.\n\n\"And what... what do they say?\"\n\nJack smiled and pulled out a knife concealed somewhere I didn't want to think about. \"They need payment. The beings... they need payment for life on Earth to continue. And that's a blood sacrifice. Sorry bro.\"  \n\n\"Wait! Jack! Wait...\"\n\n\"No can do,\" he replied, voice lifting into a shrill imitation of singing. \"You are not the greatest person in the world. You are just their tribute...\"",

Just going to slip out the Apple Mac and make like Jeff Goldblum, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to look at him. &amp;quot;Are you going to help or not?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack gave his serious look - or as close to serious as that face ever could manage - then crossed his eyes, as if someone had slapped him on the face. &amp;quot;EERrrrrrrr....NOT!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused, closed the laptop - why the damn aliens hadn&amp;#39;t taken it off me I had no idea - and stared back at him with incredulity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why not? We&amp;#39;re both prisoner...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No-charoney, cabroney. I am not a prisoner of these inter-dimensional beings. And aliens is just a touch racist, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What? Why the hell are you here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; Jack leapt up, somehow going into a star jump. &amp;quot;Because it&amp;#39;s friggin&amp;#39; awesome! Look around you! It&amp;#39;s a shiny fest of amazing futurology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s...That&amp;#39;s not what futurology means! I...&amp;quot; I paused. Caught my breath, slumped down the metal sides of the ship. I assume they were metal - I just wasn&amp;#39;t willing to ask him in case he did an impromptu air guitar solo and rock horns. Instead, I summoned up the Zen tranquility I could only find when Pauly Shore movies forced me to blot out existence beyond my own thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Status check. I&amp;#39;m alive. On a space ship of some kind, that&amp;#39;s clear. With Jack Black, for some reason. Still fully dressed, which bodes well. Still with my laptop. I opened it up, Jack collapsing down next to me like we were bros that had just tucked into the sweetest of burritos together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prayed for the Zen peaks of &lt;em&gt;Bio Dome&lt;/em&gt; to forget that I&amp;#39;d used the term &amp;#39;bro&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, you a fan of my movies?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I liked &lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What? Pft. I mean, I get it, it&amp;#39;s fitting, but I died as soon as the aliens landed. OMG, SPOILER! I meant the classics. &lt;em&gt;Gulliver&amp;#39;s Travels&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Shallow Hal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Tropic Thunder&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I was in that,&amp;quot; he over-emphasised the word, screwing his finger into the floor, &amp;quot;though everyone only remembers RDJ.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a reason for that. I opened up the laptop again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/em&gt;. That was OK. &lt;em&gt;School of...&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I caught myself before I said it. Too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roooooooooooooooooooooooocccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkk.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I groaned. &amp;quot;Look, you might be OK up here, but I&amp;#39;m not. I want to get out. And... wait.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Suddenly he was leaning over. &amp;quot;What is it, bro? Discovered something critical? Something important?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;WHY DO ALIENS HAVE WI-FI?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you. Not aliens. Inter-dimensional beings.

Were led back through that crumbling nightmare of concrete, down the dimly lit corridors, to the Dear Leader himself.\n\nI think I'd begun to understand it by then. The reason the concrete looked so rough was that there was no metal reinforcement there: the core of the beams had gone, and the whole of Pyongyang - or wherever it was - had caved in on itself. The death toll must have been in the millions. Then there were those who died when the agent struck them. Millions more. And, finally, there were those who survived but were found too late - who were smothered in their cocoon. No wonder North Korea had become a ghost town.\n\nThe Dear Leader listened to me as I explained it. Potter interjected a few times, when I got the science wrong. He denied none of it. Just kept eating a salad - with a plastic spork.\n\n\"Why didn't you ask for help?\" I said. I already knew the answer.\n\n\"Because you wouldn't have believed us.\"\n\n\"We would have. We do. It's obvious.\" Then he set the spork down.\n\n\"Do you know Milton? I read it at school. 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven'. My country is in ruins. But... if we asked for help, you'd destroy it. You'd plunder it. You'd let South Korea rape us. And I? I'd be dead. A show trial. Or perhaps blamed for all of this. You'd claim that I was making a biological weapon, when it was an agricultural experiment that went wrong.\"\n\nHe laughed. He understood the irony. Years of shouting for war, and it was an attempt at peace that had ruined him.\n\n\"So now what?\" I asked. Dear Leader sighed.\n\n\"Go,\" he said. \"I could keep you here, but there's no point. You'll send more. You'll always send more. You'll shed blood in the belief that we want you dead. And I'm tired of blood. I just want it to end. I just want my people to be safe.\"\n\nOdd. He was doing everything he could for his own way of life. He wasn't someone to be pitied, or feared, or hated. He was just another human being.\n\nWe left - on horse and cart - an hour or so later. Took a deserted highway through a crumbling, collapsed city. The fog was everywhere, but now we seemed immunised against it.\n\nAnd that's how you find us now. Standing at the DMZ. Looking out across the minefield. And I have no damn idea if we can cross it. I don't know what will happen to us. But I know you'll come for...\n\nHey. Hey! Don't go. Don't go, please!

Get out of here. We need to talk to Dear Leader. And if he doesn&amp;#39;t let us out... then we bust out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "\"What took you so long?\" Damn, such a simple question. But at the time I wasn't inclined to answer. You don't, when you're cracked out of some kind of hive. You just stare blankly at the horror of it all, stare at the substance - oozed out of your own body - that encased you. Watch as it crumbles to dust on the floor, and masked attendants rush forward to clean it. They stripped my clothing, too: cut it straight off my body until I stood there, naked. Dear Leader didn't bat an eyelid, just kept staring at me, eye to eye, while the masked attendants shoved me into a crude hospital gown.\n\nDear Leader didn't wear any of the protective gear. Turns out he, like around 80% of North Koreans still alive, was infected. A carrier. Given the situation, I was surprised he came in person. Perhaps he didn't; he always struck me as the kind of person to have a body double.\n\n\"Well?\" he said. \n\n\"We didn't know.\" I still didn't; it was a weak response to the question, but I was so lost and confused it seemed to be the only thing to say. \n\n\"Didn't know?\" He paced. In the coming days, I realised it was a trait of his - to pace when he was angry. A petulant little reminder to when he was still the most important figure in his universe. \"My entire country blacked out. Vanished. Enclosed from the world. And you didn't know?\"\n\n\"You'd been retreating for years. Things grew darker, then we thought you were deploying a smoke screen to hide your nuclear tests. Then...\"\n\nHe held up his hand. I expected an outburst about the 'decadent west' or 'imperialist dogs' or some other hokey, catchphrase line. Dear Leader disappointed. \"It doesn't matter,\" he said, as if all these international concerns were irrelevant. \"You're here now. And you matter.\"\n\n\"Matter?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, with a laugh. \"Matter. Because the USA doesn't let its army personnel vanish without trace. An entire nation, millions of people, can fade into this unnatural mist, and you won't do a thing. But an armored personnel carrier's worth of soldiers? You'll send in everything.\"\n\n\"I still don't know what's going on,\" I said. \n\n\"All in good time,\" he nodded. \"For now, you probably want to meet your fellow survivors of The Process.\"\n\n\"Survivors? Process? What the hell is...\"\n\n\"All. In. Good. Time.\" And with that I felt two guards grab me. Neither were armed. In fact, no one in the room was armed. It seemed a strange oversight, until I realised... there was no metal anywhere. Dear Leader's belt was cheap plastic; the cleaning crew used plastic. The clothes were cloth, but there were no metal insignia or medals. Dear Leader nodded, and I found myself hauled out, down a dim corridor lit by lightsticks, to another room. \n\nThere were five there with me. Potter; Hollins; Jackson; Phillips; and  Sliwinski. All in hospital gowns. Korean hospital gowns - comically short on Hollins and Potter, who were both well over six foot.\n\n\"Get the green treatment, sir?\" Hollins asked. I nodded. Potter shuffled forward, to get a better look at me.\n\n\"What the hell is going on?\" I asked.\n\n\"Beats me, sir,\" Jackson said, her lips curled in a sneer. \"They ain't told us shit.\"\n\n\"Stripped us out of those things, took our clothes, asked what we were doing here,\" Hollins said.\n\n\"Took our dog tags,\" Sliwinski added.\n\n\"Took my piercings, too.\"\n\n\"Didn't explain why. Just shoved us in here.\"\n\n\"The only thing we do know,\" Sliwinski sighed, \"is that we're it.\"\n\nShe didn't need to elaborate what she meant. Finishing his exam, Potter slapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\"Well,\" he commented. \"If I hadn't seen green goo slime out of your body, I'd have said you were in perfect health.\"\n\nSomehow it wasn't reassuring.

I know command sent up drones ahead of us, but couldn't get a damn reading from them because of the weather. And there we were, thinking that satellites weren't showing any lights because they were behind the times. What fools we were. It was the mist. It was always that damn mist. When it fell over an entire country like a goddamn shroud we should have known something was amiss.\n\nStill, we entered. A lone team, slowly making its way down a narrow bridge through the world's biggest minefield. A bridge that had been used in countless prisoner exchanges, and was supposed to be guarded by the world's most fanatical army. \n\nOnly it wasn't. It was silent. The buildings were vacant. The watchtowers were empty, their searchlights inactive. There wasn't an animal in sight. No North Korean welcoming committee. No birds or small creatures rushing out of our headlights. Not even a decomposing body. There was not a goddamn thing.\n\nOf course, that's just what the driver told us. We were in the back, getting bounced around. But you could see the Stryker team getting unnerved by the whole affair. And the total absence of sound - except the rumble of our own treads - turned my arms to gooseflesh. \n\nI think we must have fell sick within the first two miles - it's hard to say from the back of a transport truck, getting shoved this way and that in a mental hulk built for safety not comfort. We hadn't reached the Peace Village when Hollens began coughing; I remember Phillips commenting that the DMZ was still in sight, because he could see the lights from the South Koreans (who weren't stupid enough to reignite a war by investigating themselves). \n\nAnyway. Like I said, Hollens started coughing first. I think it was one of the women - Jackson, perhaps - next. At first we thought it was some kind of fine particle; Dr Potter remarked he was surprised it got through the biohazard filters. Still, when three more had collapsed - and green shit started piling out of Hollens' mouth - we all whipped on the gas masks. And by then it was too late.\n\nThe Stryker must have stopped on the edges of the Peace Village. I don't know, because I fell to fits shortly after Phillips and the driver - what was his name? Anyway. The coughing started. Then the green goo. Just everywhere - out of my nose, my mouth, my anus. Every pore began leaking it. By the time I realised what was happening my lungs were too full to scream, and all that came out were the melted gargles of what I thought would be my final, juddering breaths. Someone, one of the last, was whimpering, I think. But by then the goo was in my ears, the world was a blurry smear of ooze, and I was on the floor of the Stryker, curled up and crying emerald tears.\n\nWe watched each other die, unable to do anything. Watched as we hardened, solidified, turned into cocoons and chrysalises. \n\nThe next thing I knew, I was in a plain room underground somewhere. Pyongyang, maybe. Sterile, clean, empty. And the Dear Leader stood in front of me, his men breaking me out of the scab-like honeycomb that had frozen me in time. He was shorter than I expected. Lost a lot of that weight, too, to the point that his skin had begun to sag from his face. He tilted his head, scratching between his eyes for a moment, before he finally addressed me in clear, unbroken English.\n\n\"What took you so long?\" he asked.",

There's really nothing more to it than that.\n\nAs for money - part of it is budget, part of it is playing smart. Budget I'll ignore as there's plenty of resources for that. But playing smart is about looking at where you want to go, and working out when is affordable. For example, don't book a week-long break to a holiday destination in July. It's peak season and you can't afford it. Don't book a flight in China in the first week of October - the whole country takes the week off. Don't try to fly to the US at Christmas. \n\nLook for cheap alternatives - go for places off the beaten path - I recently got a holiday to Taiwan for the same price as a short haul flight (I'm in the UK).

Another example - I've taken the train from London to the South of France for $100 return, and spent a week sunning myself in Avignon. I've also taken the train from Hong Kong to Xian in China and saved hundreds - the 30-hour sleeper service was an adventure I'm never going to forget.\n\nShort-haul, look at city breaks way, way in advance (avoid Valentine's Day) or at the last minute. I have a friend who pretty much spends every weekend travelling Europe on cycling holidays. She goes via cheap flight services (e.g. Ryanair, Easyjet), rents a bike, and comes back.

He wondered if he should ask the chef.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, barely registering a raised eyebrow of interest. If he had a coin for every messenger who brought 'grave tidings' he'd be...well. He was the king. Technically he owned all the coins. \n\n\"Sire, it's about the Royal Tourney.\"\n\n\"Which one?\" the King muttered. He had a bet on the 15-1 at Cheapside races.\n\n\"Uh... *the* Royal Tourney. Where we determine who gets the hand of...\"\n\nThe King waved away the rest of the words. \"The Princess Jessa. Yes, yes. I remember now. She was always so caught up in the traditions.\"\n\nThe tourney had been Jessa's idea. As the youngest of his 5 daughters, she had been mildly obsessed with the old ways of the Kingdom. She read books about hunting dragons, gawped and fawned at the knights as they rode out on parade, and had told her therapist about a strange fantasy involving long hair and living in a turret. The King didn't know what to do with the girl. He'd told her that dragons were now a protected species under the Royal Conservation Act. He'd explained that the knights were largely ceremonial, and most of them had their visors down because they were nursing epic hangovers from their nightly binges. He'd never actually spoken to her about the turret fantasy because he'd found out via his former spymaster, Henrik Crump. Former, because the moment the king found out Crump had been breaking patient-therapist confidentiality he'd fired him and had the idiot's balls lopped off.\n\nThe messenger coughed. The King stopped his drifting expository thoughts and gave a smile. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well... this year was a test of skill, involving a log.\"\n\n\"It's always a test of skill. And always involves logs. It's part of the sponsorship deal my grandfather agreed with Brave Harry's Timber.\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. Well... this year was a travesty. We thought it would be good to shake things up, and have a log-running competition. Only...only...\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The King sat up, almost upsetting his mysterious-leafed salad. \n\n\"It was won by... a woman!\"\n\nThe King's eyebrow finally raised. \"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire! I know! A woman! With a lady bits and boobs and everything! And she's insisting on her prize! She says that she has won fair and square, and that she should be entitled to the Princesses' hand in marriage.\"\n\n\"And what does Jessa think of this?\"\n\n\"Well, I told you, sire! Grave news! She thinks the winner - her name is Margery, by the way - is just fab. She says that it is her duty to marry her champion, and that she and Margery will wed as soon as you permit it!\"\n\nThe King thought for a moment. \"I see.\" Then he rose, slowly, setting aside his lunch.\n\n\"Messenger, how long have you served me?\"\n\n\"Four years, highness.\" \n\n\"And...in those four years... have I ever given you the impression that I was anything other than a good and noble king, who wants the best for his daughters?\"\n\n\"No, highness.\"\n\n\"Then.... messenger... why the hell should I give a damn if my daughter wants to marry a woman? This is a fair and liberal society. I don't care if my daughter is gay. Or straight. Or bisexual. Or pan. Or the one that I'm not entirely sure of, but is equally OK. If the two women love each other, let them wed. If they make each other happy, then I'm all for it. And you, you little turnip... if you ever come barging in, interrupting my dinner, to spread your bigoted, cloistered view that a woman winning a contest is 'grave' or a 'travesty' again, I will ship you off to Doom Mountain as part of the team that refuels the volcano for the tourists. Am I understood?\"\n\nThe messenger gulped, and, bowing in between apologies, retreated.\n\n\"Sexist prick,\" the King muttered. \"Now, can someone fetch the Royal Chef? I want to know what this leafy thing in my salad happens to be.\"  ",
