I endured countless chemotherapy infusions, blood, and platelet transfusions, and spent over 120 days in the hospital. Seven months after I finished treatment, I relapsed. My prognosis without a bone marrow transplant was not good. Luckily, I had my matching donor in the Gift of Life marrow Registry, and he thankfully gave me my life-saving transplant on February 28th, 2019. It was a tough road, as I battled severe complications and spent another 100 or so days in the hospital. But I’m now cancer free!! I do struggle daily with a condition that can happen after a transplant called “chronic graft versus host disease”, but I’m not letting it slow me down. I’m now in college to become a biomedical engineer and I volunteer as a Campus Ambassador for the Gift of Life Marrow Registry. I’m helping to add new donors to the registry so that no one has to wait for this life-saving procedure because they can’t find a match.\n\nTony: My name is Tony (TJ) Connell. I grew up in Burlison, TN and graduated from the University of Memphis in 2018. I currently live in Nashville, TN and work in research for a pharmaceutical company. My journey with Gift of Life started in college where I signed up at a ZBT fraternity event at the University of Georgia – Athens. In February 2019, I received a call that I was matched to donate bone marrow to a young woman battling leukemia. I immediately said yes. My experience donating was exceptional, and a year later I got to meet that young woman, Bri. It was a special moment for the two of us and now I want to help educate others about bone marrow donation and how to help those battling blood diseases.\n\nWe were given the amazing opportunity to meet this February at a Nashville Predators Game. Since then, we have both become involved with Gift of Life and help to add new donors to the registry. We hope to educate others about the importance of becoming a donor and the incredible impact that you can have in someone’s life. We are excited to answer any questions you may have about us or bone marrow/stem cell donation.\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/themazterlives/status/1299704190336487424?s=21) )\n\nLink to our Story [here](https://www.giftoflife.org/posts/post/marrow-donor-meets-teen-transplant-recipient-at-nashville-predators-game) and [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_pwEXTluNw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)\n\nYou can become a donor [here](https://www.giftoflife.org/dc/BrianneD1) if you live in the US.",

I endured countless chemotherapy infusions, blood, and platelet transfusions, and spent over 120 days in the hospital. Seven months after I finished treatment, I relapsed. My prognosis without a bone marrow transplant was not good. Luckily, I had my matching donor in the Gift of Life marrow Registry, and he thankfully gave me my life-saving transplant on February 28th, 2019. It was a tough road, as I battled severe complications and spent another 100 or so days in the hospital. But I’m now cancer free!! I do struggle daily with a condition that can happen after a transplant called “chronic graft versus host disease”, but I’m not letting it slow me down. I’m now in college to become a biomedical engineer and I volunteer as a Campus Ambassador for the Gift of Life Marrow Registry. I’m helping to add new donors to the registry so that no one has to wait for this life-saving procedure because they can’t find a match.\n\nTony: My name is Tony (TJ) Connell. I grew up in Burlison, TN and graduated from the University of Memphis in 2018. I currently live in Nashville, TN and work in research for a pharmaceutical company. My journey with Gift of Life started in college where I signed up at a ZBT fraternity event at the University of Georgia – Athens. In February 2019, I received a call that I was matched to donate bone marrow to a young woman battling leukemia. I immediately said yes. My experience donating was exceptional, and a year later I got to meet that young woman, Bri. It was a special moment for the two of us and now I want to help educate others about bone marrow donation and how to help those battling blood diseases.\n\nWe were given the amazing opportunity to meet this February at a Nashville Predators Game. Since then, we have both become involved with Gift of Life and help to add new donors to the registry. We hope to educate others about the importance of becoming a donor and the incredible impact that you can have in someone’s life. We are excited to answer any questions you may have about us or bone marrow/stem cell donation.\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/themazterlives/status/1299704190336487424?s=21) )\n\nLink to our Story [here](https://www.giftoflife.org/posts/post/marrow-donor-meets-teen-transplant-recipient-at-nashville-predators-game) and [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_pwEXTluNw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)\n\nYou can become a donor [here](https://www.giftoflife.org/dc/BrianneD1) if you live in the US.",

        "selftext": "[standard proof](https://imgur.com/a/UTWXpJu)\n\nI was first diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia on November 16th, 2017. Because of many bad experiences with a couple of different doctors the time I came into the ER my counts were so bad that the doctors and nurses seemed shocked I was walking, talking, and breathing fine on my own. \n\nAfter my diagnosis I was told I would be held in the children’s hospital for 4-5 rounds of vicious chemotherapy. I was allowed one week in between rounds (when my counts were strong enough to leave the hospital but not start the next dose of treatment) and I actually got to be home for Christmas that year. I ended up spending more around 7.5 months inpatient mainly due to septic shock I had after my last inpatient round of chemotherapy. I hadn’t left the hospital yet but we thought I maybe had a week, which was exciting because I had a DC trip with Camp Sunshine up soon, an awards banquet for American Red Cross Youth Hero Awards as well as Prom. Unfortunately I was unable to attend any of the events but the nurses threw me a prom and I got my award in the hospital as well. \n\nAfter that I had a pretty great 7 months. I went to Camp Sunshine-a camp for teens and children cancer survivors-and I went to their senior retreat. It was an Outward Bound Event where we camped out in the Colorado mountains with tarps (the councilors had tents while the boys had one tarp to set up and share and the girls had another.) It was definitely a life changing experience with tons of adventures. It was definitely the hardest on me physically as I was closest off treatment and dealt with bad altitude sickness being the only one who lives below sea level and hasn’t spent much time above it. \n\nI also went back to helping my old boss at her art studio, mostly in her sewing classes where she would work with a small group and I focused my attention on one autistic child who needed extra help, both behaviorally and artistically. I then got a new job and was training to be a 911 dispatcher/call taker for my county. The plan was to do that and online college once training was finished. I wanted to become a biomedical engineer which I’ve aspired to be since I was 9. \n\nI still talked a bit to Caleb, who also had AML that went to the Outward Bound program together. Other than the occasional post or two on our snap group chat and instagram/Snapchat following I didn’t really keep up with anyone else. Caleb relapsed sometime in Late September or October. I was beginning to deal with some sketchy lab work and symptoms so it freaked me out as well as genuinely concerned me for him. But we’re both pretty upbeat when it comes to it; so it didn’t seem like too much. Unfortunately I followed close behind and Dec. 6th I relapsed as well. We were supposed to visit him in his hospital (the only hospital around that does BMT transplants) when I was visiting (it’s pretty far from me) but his lab work was good enough not to need a second round originally planned so we didn’t get to see each other.\n\nI then finished my initial round of chemotherapy and went straight into full remission (with a few bumps in the road-I did have a lot of issues with my old hospital).  Unfortunately during that time-Caleb passed from an infection which was really hard for me. My best friend I made at camp attended the funeral so it makes me happy to know for sure he got a nice send off with a lot of people who genuinely cared about him. I was then cleared for transplant, and had what so far seems to be a successful one. 🤞 I am dealing with some side effects and back for another inpatient stay, but I’ll likely go back to the Ronald McDonald Soon.\n\nI know that’s a lot of information; but I promise that’s just the basic outline of my story. There is so much to tell and so much to learn about my story. Ask me anything. Nothing’s off limits. There’s a lot of things to talk about and AYA cancers in general are very rarely talked about. My goal is to spread my experience to hopefully help others as well. Most importantly to let people my age know that they do have a voice-and they may have not have ended up in some of the bad circumstances that I did because I was scared to use mine at first. \n\n“Proof” \n[Instagram where I sometimes add updates ](https://www.instagram.com/brimarie100/)\n\n[American Red Cross Youth Heroes Award](https://imgur.com/gallery/dJ3O5Ro)",

At this time; I was about day 45 of my first admission—I’ve since been readmitted hopefully for a much shorter stay but it’s been a little bit since then and a lot has happened so forgive me if it’s a little off. This particular day there was a band in the garden for patients and everyone to go watch. A volunteer was going down and took me. The kid in the story seemed okay. Idk why he was there, but he seemed high energy and feeling okay, not hooked up on anything. He wasn’t the problem in the story, he actually seemed really sweet and I hope whatever he was here for was resolved. His mom on the other hand...\n\nEM-Entitled Mom\nKid-Sweet kid of EM\nRN1-Nurse 1\nRN2-Nurse 2\nCL-Child Life Specialist\nMe-Random Cancer Patient \nPinky-the small pink elephant I’ve had since I was 4 who my late grandmother got me and has been to every procedure, test, etc. sitting nicely on part of my pole\n\nThe story started when we got down to the garden. I was old enough and there’s enough people around that the Volunteer lets me go off by myself to walk around the garden while I just listen to the band play a bit. I had to do some weaving when I was around where most of the people were (lots of wheelchairs, poles, and red wagons to avoid) but overall I wasn’t much of a nuisance walking around. I stopped for a bit to rest, and the kid came up to me (EM was watching from close by) and smiled. I smiled back. \n\nKid: What’s that? (Points to Pinky)\nMe: That’s my elephant. His name is Pinky and he’s very old. \nKid: Can I hold him?\nMe: sure, but be very gentle.\n\nAnd he was, I asked him to put him back after a minute or so and he did, leaving back to his mom. I could hear EM ask him a few questions about what he was doing and didn’t think anything of it until she came over. Kid stays, playing with RN1 and a kazoo\n\nEM: how much for the elephant?\nMe: not for sale, sorry\nEM: Cmon my kid is sick, can’t you just give him this one thing ?\nMe: I’m sorry, but I’ve had him forever. He’s been with me through everything.\nEM: You sure the hospital didn’t give him to you? Everyone else seems to get stuff from here all the time. Kid has gotten barely anything. (My elephant is obviously very old and fragile) \nMe: I’m sorry, but it’s a no. I’ve had him since I was four. (At this point I pick Pinky up)\nEM (getting angry at this point): CMON, all you’ve been doing this whole time is annoying people with your stupid pole. There’s a show going on and you’re just wondering about. Where’s your nurse? You need to be kicked out.\n\nAt this point RN2 comes over. \nRN2: What’s the matter? Is something wrong?\nEM:Yes, this girl is annoying everyone and hoarding hospital toys. \nRN2: (completely confused) what toys?\nEM points to my elephant.\nCL now steps in.\nCL: that’s her elephant, she’s always had it. And she wasn’t annoying anyone. This garden is still for people to walk, show or not.\nEM: She should be kicked out. It’s not fair.\nCL: she does not and I will have you kicked out if you don’t sit down now. \nEM then sat down and tired of the whole thing, I asked the volunteer to take me back upstairs.\n\nSorry for the non dramatic ending if that’s what you were looking for. And for any mistakes as I’m on mobile.\n\n[edit add photo of Pinky](https://imgur.com/gallery/wGvw22k)",

Also posted on r/teenagers \n\nBackground (there needs to be a lot for this story): I was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia at 17 and am 19 now (my last year of being a teen.) I first just had 7 months of inpatient chemotherapy but I relapsed and needed a bone marrow transplant. Which I received 5 hours away from where I live. I am actually day 47 inpatient today, day +40 post-transplant. Shortly after my transplant I had a rare complication known as VOD where the liver does not filter out fluids. It affected my liver, kidneys, and lungs. Because of this, I needed to be put on bipap and taken to the ICU. I would also like to stress I’ve heard all this second hand and remember none of it. \n\nOne of my best friends is also a cancer survivor. She has been through 3 separate bone marrow transplants and has had a lot of weird things happen to her body. (I met her through one of my teachers but she lives up here and goes to the same hospital for over 10 years.) She is 23 but it is a childhood cancer so she’s treated here. She decided to visit me in ICU when my mom updated her about what was going on. She brought me a T-Rex to show me how strong I was. During her last bone marrow transplant she had to go far off to receive an experimental therapy known as CAR-T cell therapy. She will need monthly infusions for this for a long time. For this, she has a port. \n\nAs she was visiting, she wore a white shirt. This is when the weird thing happened. In order to get anything in or out of a port, it needs to be accessed with a long needle that goes through the skin. She was here, however, strictly to visit and had not had her port accessed anytime around this. However, she quickly noticed that she felt something wet going down her chest.  My doctor was also in the room at the time, and warned her that she had blood gushing down her shirt. She pulled the shirt down and immediately applied pressure with a towel on the counter. My parents had to page my nurses to help her. Luckily the bleeding was controlled, she had a blood test to make sure she didn’t need a transfusion, and was then able to go home. She also told me she had laughed all the way through it and of course I did as well when she told me about it. \n\nLuckily I am out of ICU now. I had been one step from needing dialysis for my kidneys and they are almost completely healed now, as well as my liver. This is also the first night since ICU that I slept through the night and didn’t once need oxygen. I have a drug that has to be strictly monitored that ends Saturday so they said I can probably move into the Ronald McDonald House early next week.",

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to stress that I am not pretending to have a terminal illness. I know that is happening a lot around here. And I can provide proof of my actual illness if needed. Also this is my first reddit post, and I am on mobile, so please understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background (there needs to be a lot for this story): I was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia at 17 and am 19 now (my last year of being a teen.) I first just had 7 months of inpatient chemotherapy but I relapsed and needed a bone marrow transplant. Which I received 5 hours away from where I live. I am actually day 47 inpatient today, day +40 post-transplant. Shortly after my transplant I had a rare complication known as VOD where the liver does not filter out fluids. It affected my liver, kidneys, and lungs. Because of this, I needed to be put on bipap and taken to the ICU. I would also like to stress I’ve heard all this second hand and remember none of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my best friends is also a cancer survivor. (Actually both are, but the second is not in this story, but is in many more I have to tell.) She has been through 3 separate bone marrow transplants and has had a lot of weird things happen to her body. (I met her through one of my teachers but she lives up here and goes to the same hospital for over 10 years.) She is 23 but it is a childhood cancer so she’s treated here. She decided to visit me in ICU when my mom updated her about what was going on. She brought me a T-Rex to show me how strong I was. During her last bone marrow transplant she had to go far off to receive an experimental therapy known as CAR-T cell therapy. She will need monthly infusions for this for a long time. For this, she has a port. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she was visiting, she wore a white shirt. This is when the weird thing happened. In order to get anything in or out of a port, it needs to be accessed with a long needle that goes through the skin. She was here, however, strictly to visit and had not had her port accessed anytime around this. However, she quickly noticed that she felt something wet going down her chest.  My doctor was also in the room at the time, and warned her that she had blood gushing down her shirt. She pulled the shirt down and immediately applied pressure with a towel on the counter. My parents had to page my nurses to help her. Luckily the bleeding was controlled, she had a blood test to make sure she didn’t need a transfusion, and was then able to go home. She also told me she had laughed all the way through it and of course I did as well when she told me about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily I am out of ICU now. I had been one step from needing dialysis for my kidneys and they are almost completely healed now, as well as my liver. This is also the first night since ICU that I slept through the night and didn’t once need oxygen. I have a drug that has to be strictly monitored that ends Saturday so they said I can probably move into the Ronald McDonald House early next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Then things took a turn for the worst. I got VOD which is when your liver stops filtering out fluid. It affected my liver, kidneys, and lungs. I was put on bipap and taken to ICU. I don’t remember any at all of the first 5-6 days. (Ended up losing 10 days of my life all together) \n\nThat Saturday I “woke up” essentially. My nurse seemed nice at first. She’d apparently been my nurse before when I was out, and my parents thought she had done a pretty good job. From the beginning I noticed a few things that were kinda turning me off towards her. Because of all my great experiences here and expectations they all kind of start of at 100% likability to me. First, it was kinda how she told me to take my meds. She was just really short with me. Then I had to get up to pee. She didn’t like that I had unhooked some of my stuff myself. She just seemed like she was annoyed with me waking up or something. (I’m extremely polite, even when I’m super sick and out of it, many of my nurses told me that even though I was in so much pain and so sick I was still super sweet and optimistic.) \n\nThe big kicker came when she told me we were going to go out to the garden. She acted like it wasn’t even a choice-but that wasn’t what really got on my nerves. When we got to the garden I started to get really bad gas pain. I started holding my middle, and stood where I was at for a bit. She told me to work through it. Okay, fine I understood. I tried to walk some more, but the pain got worse and tears started to form. I asked to go inside. She said no. I had to keep going. So I tried to keep going but I couldn’t-the pain was so bad. I threw up. I could hear her audibly sigh and I could feel her eyes rolling at me. I kinda had it at that point. She did let me get back in the wheel chair and said “fine, we’ll go back.” I could feel her annoyance with me. \n\nI got back and had to pee. She seemed even more annoyed with that since I had just peed before we left. Over the next few hours I had to pee a lot. Eventually she said I was having bladder spasms and wouldn’t let me go anymore. It was bad, especially since I was going almost every time, even if it was in trickles. But I had been so backed up with all those fluids for so long. Throughout the day she just seemed to get more annoyed and it started to turn into anger. \n\nThen, to God’s wonderful grace, she left about two hours later. I was overjoyed. Two other really sweet nurses took care of me and when they had a Kendra Scott prom they got me a bracelet/necklace matching set, and a shaw type thing as well as some stickers and cute little bags to put them in since I couldn’t go. They put on some music and danced with me. I really doubt the other nurse would’ve cared to get me those things or enjoy it like I was able to. My parents got a nice five course dinner and they brought me back a nice tie dye shirt with the hospital logo that they were giving out to the patients.\n\nI wanted to update my post to show my purpose. I am thinking of becoming a nurse as well. Over the years I’ve mostly had good to amazing nurses. I didn’t want to belittle anyone or say anything bad about nurses. But this experience taught me a lot about bad bedside manner, what it looks like and what really sticks with a person. I know that this teeters on the more extreme side, so maybe that’s why some people were offended. I do truly apologize for that. Like I said, I love this hospital and most people in it. She had me when I was out and my parents said she was great so idk what was going on that day.",
