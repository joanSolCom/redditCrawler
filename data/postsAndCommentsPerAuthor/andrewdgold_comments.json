That's not to say that yours isn't particularly insightful, and obviously you guys have some great insight because of your position in the industry.\n\nIt's just an absolutely packed industry, and you're asking NBA fans to choose your episodes ahead of other already-established ones. There are too many podcasts to choose from. 50% of all podcasts don't get more than 100 listens in the first month. Only 5% make 7,000 in the first month, which isn't even enough to earn a living (you need at least 10k for that). \n\nAll of that is to say that social media can only go so far. I think you need to first focus on making your podcast exceptional. That involves making sure you both have great microphones, that it's tightly edited to include only the best, funniest, most interesting points, that it has cool music (but not too much of it - listeners are impatient!).\n\nAnd the holy grail, as some other suggested - cool guests. My podcast is five months old and gets 3-4k listens a week, sometimes more. Firstly, I did all of the above, and made sure the podcast was high quality. Then, I kept pushing guests with big social media audiences to come on, and asking them to share one or two video trailers I'd made on Twitter and Insta. I have a couple thousand followers myself, but when I share, it gets like 5-10 likes max. But when they share, sometimes it goes semi-viral. There must be so many NBA players and ex-players, pundits etc, who'd love to come on your show and chat basketball.\n\nI still do have guests that don't have any social media presence...but I try to make sure that they often do!

I made a Theroux-esque doc about exorcism for BBC 3 that you can still find on iPlayer and YouTube. \n\nBut it is tough to think of who to get on the show that'll be fascinating while also increasing reach - the latest episode with Robbie from AFTV was a perfect guest in that sense coz he's so interesting and different, and also has a huge following. But the head boy paedophile was tricky - he obviously doesn't have a following and wouldn't share it if he did! And a lot of people are too scared to share or even listen to something with the P word in the title!\n\nI have been looking into the topic for 2 years because in Berlin - where I live - there's a program called Don't Offend - and they are unique because they never report paedophiles to the authorities, whether or not they've offended. It's state-sponsored, and I found it really strange, so looked into it. They introduced me to a few patients, who then intro'd me to a few more etc...eventually I found this guy and thought he'd be interesting for a pod.

I'd love that - and that's why I got transhumanist Zoltan Istvan on my podcast to talk about how we can actually do that with science. \n\nIt appears that Anneliese Michel had a similar issue to some of the people in my documentary (which I recommend you watch, it's entertaining, but also sad). Candela, the main character in my documentary, had an eating disorder. I think when you tell people who have such a serious condition that it's all down to a demon - that the world is composes of good and bad, light and darkness - it's a hell of a lot simpler for the brain to process than the complex reality of severe psychiatric illness. \n\nSo, it looks to me like she died of malnutrition, dehydration and pneumonia.

        "body": "&gt;Yes, great Q! Very recently actually. I've been looking into paedophiles for a book I've been writing. It's been a year of earning trust. Then, a couple of weeks ago, it was revealed that the alleged abductor of Madeleine McCann (a big news story about a young girl in the UK) was German. I live in Berlin and have been talking to non-offending paedophiles. In my haste to grab a scoop, I entered a  message I really regret now, asking if anyone there knew the paedophile who abducted Madeleine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Not only were they offended that I'd suggest they knew him (since they were non-offending paedophiles) but they were really angry that I'd used the word paedophile to describe the man who took her. It's a cultural thing - the British papers called him that, but Germans apparently differentiate between the paedophile (someone with feeling for children) and abusers (those who actually attack or abduct children). They were so, so angry at me...",

It&amp;#39;s been a year of earning trust. Then, a couple of weeks ago, it was revealed that the alleged abductor of Madeleine McCann (a big news story about a young girl in the UK) was German. I live in Berlin and have been talking to non-offending paedophiles. In my haste to grab a scoop, I entered a  message I really regret now, asking if anyone there knew the paedophile who abducted Madeleine.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only were they offended that I&amp;#39;d suggest they knew him (since they were non-offending paedophiles) but they were really angry that I&amp;#39;d used the word paedophile to describe the man who took her. It&amp;#39;s a cultural thing - the British papers called him that, but Germans apparently differentiate between the paedophile (someone with feeling for children) and abusers (those who actually attack or abduct children). They were so, so angry at me...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

After filming with the so-called Crazy Baby Lady (look her up!) in Argentina, she sent me messages in the days that followed, one of which read, 'I've been sent photos of people's abortions, I've been sent death threats, but I've never felt as betrayed as I did by you.'\n\nI think people have this stereotype of the journalist as this bad guy - a little like a lawyer, you know - bad rep! But, man, I couldn't sleep for days after that, I felt terrible. The thing was, she was the face of the pro-life campaign there. And it so happened that her father had been part of a dictatorship that 'disappeared' people and took their babies and sold them to rich Right-wing families. So after spending weeks with her, claiming to be neutral on the abortion topic, I sprung that question on her. \n\nThe thing is, I think I managed to convince myself I was neutral. Sometimes I've strived to be neutral and found both sides have been annoyed. \n\nIn a very long answer to your question, the way I earned her trust was by calling and texting her for months, joking around with her...and I think once you turn the camera on, people are pretty cool, they understand what you're doing. I REALLY didn't want to betray her trust, but looking back, can see why she's pissed off. I think just try to be honest with people, and say 'ok - I gotta turn this camera on now' - make a joke a of it. Now, more than before, I tell people before they agree - 'you might not necessarily come out that well out of it - some people will love you and some won't'...But in any case, get those release forms signed first!\n\nAnd good luck documenting the demonstrations, it's really important work and you should be proud!",

That's not to say that yours isn't particularly insightful, and obviously you guys have some great insight because of your position in the industry.\n\nIt's just an absolutely packed industry, and you're asking NBA fans to choose your episodes ahead of other already-established ones. There are too many podcasts to choose from. 50% of all podcasts don't get more than 100 listens in the first month. Only 5% make 7,000 in the first month, which isn't even enough to earn a living (you need at least 10k for that). \n\nAll of that is to say that social media can only go so far. I think you need to first focus on making your podcast exceptional. That involves making sure you both have great microphones, that it's tightly edited to include only the best, funniest, most interesting points, that it has cool music (but not too much of it - listeners are impatient!).\n\nAnd the holy grail, as some other suggested - cool guests. My podcast is five months old and gets 3-4k listens a week, sometimes more. Firstly, I did all of the above, and made sure the podcast was high quality. Then, I kept pushing guests with big social media audiences to come on, and asking them to share one or two video trailers I'd made on Twitter and Insta. I have a couple thousand followers myself, but when I share, it gets like 5-10 likes max. But when they share, sometimes it goes semi-viral. There must be so many NBA players and ex-players, pundits etc, who'd love to come on your show and chat basketball.\n\nI still do have guests that don't have any social media presence...but I try to make sure that they often do!

My dad said it did haha. But he's not a big podcast expert...Joe Rogan obviously does like three hours unedited, which seems mad. I interview for about 75-90 mins and edit it down to around 40, and then do an intro and outro. I tried to keep the intro and outro short (should they be longer like Adam Buxton's 5-10 mins intro?)...but it's so hard to edit the interview to shorter than 40!! Will this put people off? Does it feel long? \n\nReally appreciate the feedback,\n\nAndrew",

I made a Theroux-esque doc about exorcism for BBC 3 that you can still find on iPlayer and YouTube. \n\nBut it is tough to think of who to get on the show that'll be fascinating while also increasing reach - the latest episode with Robbie from AFTV was a perfect guest in that sense coz he's so interesting and different, and also has a huge following. But the head boy paedophile was tricky - he obviously doesn't have a following and wouldn't share it if he did! And a lot of people are too scared to share or even listen to something with the P word in the title!\n\nI have been looking into the topic for 2 years because in Berlin - where I live - there's a program called Don't Offend - and they are unique because they never report paedophiles to the authorities, whether or not they've offended. It's state-sponsored, and I found it really strange, so looked into it. They introduced me to a few patients, who then intro'd me to a few more etc...eventually I found this guy and thought he'd be interesting for a pod. I'm also writing a book, featuring the fascinating young woman who is into babies and children.\n\nI agree with your worries and, deep down, I think the same. I guess you could say that people aren't usually attracted to family members - you presumably aren't attracted to your sister or cousin, right? And if you were, you could control it. So why should he be attracted to his own son? That's the logic he would use, I guess. But I can't help but share your concerns.\n\nSo...yeah, the truth is I don't really know. He seems very confident and sure, and he was so honest about everything else with me, so why not believe him. But who knows how he'll feel in 10-20 years...",

And then we sold it (for a very low price unfortunately) to the BBC. Once we sold it, we did work with their editing teams and I was amazed by the stringency of their rules and regulations. We had to get lawyers to trawl through our documentary with a fine comb, and make changes accordingly. I had to to go back to Argentina to check on a couple of our film's interviewees for Duty of Care - to make sure, for example, that a victim of the exorcist wouldn't be put in a compromised position by the release of our documentary. We had to give the exorcist himself - who came out of the film looking quite badly indeed - the Right of Reply too. So it was all done very by the book. \n\nWhen the film came out, and I could see my own film on TV and on the BBC section of iPlayer, YouTube and our Smart TV at home, it was a very proud moment. I was with my mum and we watched the 'views' go up on YouTube. Every time we refreshed the page, another 10,000 people had watched it.\n\nThe stuff I'd done for HBO and Fusion had actually been commissioned, but even then I was a freelancer and was quite far from the action, so I don't know too much about them.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Traveling Matt! Hmm...I&amp;#39;ve only actually made one full documentary for them, and I made before on my own with my friend David Hayes. And then we sold it (for a very low price unfortunately) to the BBC. Once we sold it, we did work with their editing teams and I was amazed by the stringency of their rules and regulations. We had to get lawyers to trawl through our documentary with a fine comb, and make changes accordingly. I had to to go back to Argentina to check on a couple of our film&amp;#39;s interviewees for Duty of Care - to make sure, for example, that a victim of the exorcist wouldn&amp;#39;t be put in a compromised position by the release of our documentary. We had to give the exorcist himself - who came out of the film looking quite badly indeed - the Right of Reply too. So it was all done very by the book. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the film came out, and I could see my own film on TV and on the BBC section of iPlayer, YouTube and our Smart TV at home, it was a very proud moment. I was with my mum and we watched the &amp;#39;views&amp;#39; go up on YouTube. Every time we refreshed the page, another 10,000 people had watched it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stuff I&amp;#39;d done for HBO and Fusion had actually been commissioned, but even then I was a freelancer and was quite far from the action, so I don&amp;#39;t know too much about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "Hi Keith, great to hear from you. \n\nYes, you've hit on something that has literally kept me up at night. After filming with the so-called Crazy Baby Lady (look her up!) in Argentina, she sent me messages in the days that followed, one of which read, 'I've been sent photos of people's abortions, I've been sent death threats, but I've never felt as betrayed as I did by you.'\n\nI think people have this stereotype of the journalist as this bad guy - a little like a lawyer, you know - bad rep! But, man, I couldn't sleep for days after that, I felt terrible. The thing was, she was the face of the pro-life campaign there. And it so happened that her father had been part of a dictatorship that 'disappeared' people and took their babies and sold them to rich Right-wing families. So after spending weeks with her, claiming to be neutral on the abortion topic, I sprung that question on her. \n\nThe thing is, I think I managed to convince myself I was neutral. Sometimes I've strived to be neutral and found both sides have been annoyed. \n\nIn a very long answer to your question, the way I earned her trust was by calling and texting her for months, joking around with her...and I think once you turn the camera on, people are pretty cool, they understand what you're doing. I REALLY didn't want to betray her trust, but looking back, can see why she's pissed off. I think just try to be honest with people, and say 'ok - I gotta turn this camera on now' - make a joke a of it. Now, more than before, I tell people before they agree - 'you might not necessarily come out that well out of it - some people will love you and some won't'...But in any case, get those release forms signed first!\n\nAnd good luck documenting the demonstrations, it's really important work and you should be proud!",
