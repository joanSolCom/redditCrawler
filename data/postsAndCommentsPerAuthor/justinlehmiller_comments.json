People who fantasized more about incest in my survey tended to be turned on by the idea of other taboo activities. For many people, being told not to do something makes them want to do it even more. Also, some people are more drawn to taboos than others, in part, because they have a heightened threshold for sexual excitement--they need the taboo element in order to get off. \n\nIs there also a potential Freudian element to some of these fantasies? Perhaps, and maybe especially for those that involve parental figures.

Also, some people are more drawn to taboos than others, in part, because they have a heightened threshold for sexual excitement--they need the taboo element in order to get off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there also a potential Freudian element to some of these fantasies? Perhaps, and maybe especially for those that involve parental figures. But I think it&amp;#39;s more complex than that and also that different people can develop the same sexual fantasy for very different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I appreciate your kind comments and wish you much success with your career path!\n\nRegarding your question, no, my take on BDSM and kink is that it's not inherently abusive. In the vast majority of cases, there's mutual consent and desire to engage in power exchange and it's done in a way that isn't harmful or abusive to the folks involved. \n\nAlso, most folks in my research who reported BDSM fantasies did not have a history of sexual abuse (as either a victim or perpetrator). However, there were some who did report a previous history of trauma--but, for them, they tended to use BDSM in a therapeutic way (e.g., as a way of taking control of a previous trauma, or as a means of seeking psychological escape). \n\nThat said, there are certainly some cases where BDSM can become abusive. For example, I've been involved as an expert witness in some court cases that center around BDSM disputes--where one parter claims consensual BDSM and the other claims sexual violence.

I appreciate your kind comments and wish you much success with your career path!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding your question, no, my take on BDSM and kink is that it&amp;#39;s not inherently abusive. In the vast majority of cases, there&amp;#39;s mutual consent and desire to engage in power exchange and it&amp;#39;s done in a way that isn&amp;#39;t harmful or abusive to the folks involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, most folks in my research who reported BDSM fantasies did not have a history of sexual abuse (as either a victim or perpetrator). However, there were some who did report a previous history of trauma--but, for them, they tended to use BDSM in a therapeutic way (e.g., as a way of taking control of a previous trauma, or as a means of seeking psychological escape). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, there are certainly some cases where BDSM can become abusive. For example, I&amp;#39;ve been involved as an expert witness in some court cases that center around BDSM disputes--where one parter claims consensual BDSM and the other claims sexual violence.  As you might imagine, these are very complex cases--but they are not particularly common.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Kinks can come from a lot of different sources, but research suggests that many are learned, either through classical conditioning (Pavlovian conditioning) or through reinforcement. \n\nFor example, a study I discuss in my book from the 1960s used the Pavlovian model to condition male participants to develop a mild boot fetish. Basically, what they did was to hook men up to a device that measured genital arousal, then they showed them images of women's boots followed by images of nude women. At first, the men showed no arousal to boots, but showed arousal to the nudes. However, with repeated pairings of photos, eventually the men started showing arousal to the boots alone--the boots effectively became a cue for sexual arousal.\n\nSo learning processes like this can potentially lead to the development of kinks and fetishes.\n\nI do also see in my research that certain personality traits and sexual experiences are linked to having more kinky fantasies. For example, introverted people tend to have more kinky and taboo fantasies compared to their extraverted counterparts. Also, people who reported that their first sexual experience was \"unusual\" in some way report more kinky interests in adulthood as well, which suggests that early experiences with kink might shape more interest in this later on.",

Most people have sex before they get married (if they ever get married at all--more on that below)--the average age of first intercourse is 16-17 and it's been pretty stable for decades.

However, the average age of marriage in the US today is nearly 30--so telling people not to have sex until marriage just isn&amp;#39;t going to be realistic for most folks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The term &amp;quot;premarital sex&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t used that much in my field anymore because it implies that everyone will or wants to get married. The marriage rate is currently near a record low, and many people are opting to never get married, so we need to think about other terms. For example, some use &amp;quot;non-marital sex.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We undersample from populations that aren&amp;#39;t comfortable talking about sex or have moral issues with it. This makes sex research in general challenging--and that&amp;#39;s something I do acknowledge and talk about in the book. My sample isn&amp;#39;t representative of the population and I&amp;#39;m very up front about that. The demographics more closely match the average social media user than the average American.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, my sample was very large and diverse so I was still able to look at a number of groups that have historically be underrepresented in sex research. Specifically, I was able to look at the sex fantasies of self-identified Republicans, seniors, and persons without a college education. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The non-desire-based fantasies may result from things like having a very active imagination or being what's called a sensation seeker (meaning you have a heightened need for sexual excitement). So some fantasies are just the product of a wandering mind or the search for thrills and don't really have deeper meaning. ",

Generally speaking, the presence of the fetish object enhances arousal (and orgasm) and, in some cases, the person can't get aroused (or orgasm) unless the fetish object is there. \n\nHow many people have it isn't really a key consideration in terms of whether it's considered a fetish. Fetishes can be common or uncommon. I think the issue is that a lot of people just hear the word \"fetish\" and assume \"weird.\" The problem I see is that there's just a lot of stigma that's attached to the word \"fetish.\" Having a fetish doesn't mean you have anything wrong with you.

Generally speaking, the presence of the fetish object enhances arousal (and orgasm) and, in some cases, the person can&amp;#39;t get aroused (or orgasm) unless the fetish object is there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many people have it isn&amp;#39;t really a key consideration in terms of whether it&amp;#39;s considered a fetish. Fetishes can be common or uncommon. I think the issue is that a lot of people just hear the word &amp;quot;fetish&amp;quot; and assume &amp;quot;weird.&amp;quot; The problem I see is that there&amp;#39;s just a lot of stigma that&amp;#39;s attached to the word &amp;quot;fetish.&amp;quot; Having a fetish doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have anything wrong with you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I would then read some of them out loud and ask the students to look for themes, but also to guess whether the fantasy was written by a man or woman. It was an interesting exercise to not just learn about diversity in fantasy content, but because it also challenged some of the students' stereotypes about what men and women want. Anyway, long story short, in the process of running this exercise, I learned firsthand that some people do indeed have fantasies about sex researchers. ",

I would then read some of them out loud and ask the students to look for themes, but also to guess whether the fantasy was written by a man or woman. It was an interesting exercise to not just learn about diversity in fantasy content, but because it also challenged some of the students&amp;#39; stereotypes about what men and women want. Anyway, long story short, in the process of running this exercise, I learned firsthand that some people do indeed have fantasies about sex researchers. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I truly appreciate it!\n\nRegarding how I would change sex education, I recently published an op-ed in USA Today on the changes I'd like to see: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/07/10/teach-teens-communication-skills-not-abstinence-sex-ed-column/754305002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/07/10/teach-teens-communication-skills-not-abstinence-sex-ed-column/754305002/)\n\nThe short version is that I'd like to see us focus more on sexual communication. That's something that's lacking in most sex ed programs in the US--and we're far behind what other countries (like the Netherlands) are doing. We need to learn how to communicate better not just around issues of consent, but also in terms of expressing desire and telling each other what we really want.",

That&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s lacking in most sex ed programs in the US--and we&amp;#39;re far behind what other countries (like the Netherlands) are doing. We need to learn how to communicate better not just around issues of consent, but also in terms of expressing desire and telling each other what we really want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Kinks can come from a lot of different sources, but research suggests that many are learned, either through classical conditioning (Pavlovian conditioning) or through reinforcement. \n\nFor example, a study I discuss in my book from the 1960s used the Pavlovian model to condition male participants to develop a mild boot fetish. Basically, what they did was to hook men up to a device that measured genital arousal, then they showed them images of women's boots followed by images of nude women. At first, the men showed no arousal to boots, but showed arousal to the nudes. However, with repeated pairings of photos, eventually the men started showing arousal to the boots alone--the boots effectively became a cue for sexual arousal.\n\nSo learning processes like this can potentially lead to the development of kinks and fetishes.\n\nI do also see in my research that certain personality traits and sexual experiences are linked to having more kinky fantasies. For example, introverted people tend to have more kinky and taboo fantasies compared to their extraverted counterparts. Also, people who reported that their first sexual experience was \"unusual\" in some way report more kinky interests in adulthood as well, which suggests that early experiences with kink might shape more interest in this later on.",

However, your degree can really be in almost any scientific field--very few sex researchers get degrees specifically in sexology because few such training programs exist. My suggestion is to find the field that is the best fit for you (e.g., psychology, anthropology, sociology, etc.), then locate relevant training programs that have faculty doing the type of work that interests you. \n\nHere's a more detailed post I've written about becoming a sex researcher: [https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2013/12/20/sex-question-friday-what-is-a-sexologist-and-how-do-i-become-one](https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2013/12/20/sex-question-friday-what-is-a-sexologist-and-how-do-i-become-one)\n\nAnd here's a bit more about the path I took: [https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2018/10/24/how-and-why-i-became-a-sex-researcher](https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2018/10/24/how-and-why-i-became-a-sex-researcher)\n\nI wish you all the best with your academic pursuits and career change!",

However, your degree can really be in almost any scientific field--very few sex researchers get degrees specifically in sexology because few such training programs exist. My suggestion is to find the field that is the best fit for you (e.g., psychology, anthropology, sociology, etc.), then locate relevant training programs that have faculty doing the type of work that interests you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a more detailed post I&amp;#39;ve written about becoming a sex researcher: &lt;a href=\"https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2013/12/20/sex-question-friday-what-is-a-sexologist-and-how-do-i-become-one\"&gt;https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2013/12/20/sex-question-friday-what-is-a-sexologist-and-how-do-i-become-one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s a bit more about the path I took: &lt;a href=\"https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2018/10/24/how-and-why-i-became-a-sex-researcher\"&gt;https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2018/10/24/how-and-why-i-became-a-sex-researcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish you all the best with your academic pursuits and career change!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
