Of course that's not true.

Racism keeps people trapped in poverty, and poverty and lack of education can lead to violence. \n\n\"You seem to be in favor of working toward an equality of outcome as it pertains to race, meaning that, since median black households have less money, this is a symptom of systemic racism in the US and until those numbers are equal, systemic racism is the problem.\" -I'm in favor of equality of opportunity.

Maybe the sheer size of Asians is creating a self-selection pattern, where we really only see the absolute hardest working immigrants? I would have to read up on some studies to get a clearer idea of what's happening. \n\n\"If we accept that the only explanation for a success of a certain population is historical or systemic instead of cultural should we now try to suppress the Asian population even further until they match the average, or are whites being held down by systemic racism so they can't perform as well as their Asian compatriots?\" -See misconception #2. Systemic Racism isn't \"the only\" explanation for a success of a certain population. It just makes it more or less probable that you'll succeed, regardless of how hard, or how little you work.   \n\n\nEquality of opportunity. That's the entire issue.",
