        "selftext": "So full disclosure: I'm a porn performer, so this isn't my first rodeo obviously. But I need to gush about something that I did that I'm absurdly proud of.\n\nTl;dr: I used [desensitization therapy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Systematic-Desensitisation.html) in the process of writing my first porno script to overcome my fear of home invasion.\n\nLike 1 in 4 women, I am a survivor of sexual assault. [Contrary to popular belief, porn performers self-report histories of sexual trauma at similar levels to the rest of the population](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201409/the-main-difference-between-porn-actresses-and-other-women) and regrettably I am one of those women whose life has been impacted by sexual violence. For the first several years of my career, I was hesitant to talk about my past with sexual trauma and violence because I have frequently felt silenced by the narrative that says sex workers are damaged goods. Did my previous history lead me to this job? Was I hyper-sexualized? Perhaps! It's impossible for me to tell you with 100% accuracy. I used to think that that was something to be ashamed of, but writing this story and starring in it led me to feel differently. If I sought this job to cope with my trauma, what I can tell you is that it has presented me with many avenues for healing. I am married happily and live a fairly joyful life these days.\n\nI am a feminist, while also being a mainstream pornographer (ranked #24 in the world according to pornhub for whatever that's worth) which many 2nd wave feminists would call a contradiction in terms. It is my sincere and heartfelt belief that the people who should have the final say about what they do or don’t do on camera is the actors themselves. Not society at large or agencies or directors. What I have learned in my time in sex work is that powerplay, coercion and rape fantasies are extremely common fantasies for women while still being extremely shameful to them. Due to my previous trauma, I have never worked on kink sets or really allowed anyone to dominate me on film. I derive no pleasure from that level of vulnerability; in fact, it actively scares me. I admire the men and women who can perform in the BDSM genre and who find it pleasurable, but it has never been my cup of tea.\n\nAfter I was sexually assaulted, for many years after in fact, I had recurring nightmares of home invasion. Masked men would bang on my bedroom door and try to break into my house. I would rush from room to room trying to make sure all my doors and windows were fortified, but inevitably one would be left open and they would burst in. I would wake up right as they grabbed me in a cold sweat. An attempted kidnapping that was foiled while I visited Bolivia for work did nothing to help this and up until a few years ago I had the same nightmare at least once a month. I decided that I wanted to tell the story of that nightmare – only this time I would control the ending.\n\nPure Taboo (the company I wrote this for) focuses on telling the stories of our sexuality that we’re ashamed of. Don’t get me wrong, I have plenty of fantasies that are kind of unethical and I’m willing to bet that you do too. Maybe you get off on schoolgirls, maybe you get off on humiliation or gangbangs, whatever it is I’m willing to bet you’ve never acted on those fantasies in an illegal way. There are ways to ethically purvey the sexual parts of us we consider shameful while not devolving into immorality. So I tasked myself with telling an ethical consensual non-consent story. One where the victim became the victor. The kind of story that a victim (and many victims do report masturbating to coercion fantasies after the fact) would feel good about watching.\n\nThe movie opens with a young mafia heiress home alone, locking the doors and anxiously calling her father to request that he return home early from his business trip. Why can’t you come home, dad? You know the type of men who have it out for us. At least bring more back up than just Bruno, my bodyguard? One security guard isn’t enough for such a big house! Her concerns are dismissed and minimized. She settles into uneasy slumber and the screen cuts to an image of Bruno collapsing as three men in black storm the house and sneak into the heiress’s bedroom, grabbing her and whisking her away. The heiress regains consciousness in a darkened garage as three men discuss her fate, her father owes them money and they’ll either get it, or she will be sent to her dad in pieces.\n\nHow on earth can this fantasy be feminist? What the fuck is wrong with me? As the story plays out, it begins to look like a classic kidnapping/use me as your fuckdoll kind of fantasy. But we see the heiress carefully observing the inner dynamics of her captors’ group and subtly manipulating them against one another. She supplies them with information about her father’s finances to endear her to them, while also subtly insulting their manhood when they fail to procure funding from her father. The film climaxes with her telling them that what matters more to her father than her safety is his respectability (a subtle jab at many of the men in my life who failed me during my own trauma) and that in order to make him pay they need to record themselves graphically using her body sexually and send him the evidence and threaten to take it public. The shame would prompt her shrewd businessman father to finally cough up the money.\n\nI filmed this closed room scenario over the course of 14 hours in a 50-degree basement wearing nothing but my underwear and not eating the whole day because it was an anal scene. By the time we all started rolling into sex, I was physically exhausted and completely raw, there was absolutely no artifice. I hand picked the men with whom I would be working on this day and all of them were dear friends to me. By the time we were rolling into sex, I was already so deeply in sub space that I actually had to call cut mid-way through the scene just to cry. Not from pain, but just from the raw vulnerability and power of reliving the traumas visited upon me. I visited places in my mind as each of these men used my various orifices for their pleasure (or at least that’s what we depicted) that I hadn’t visited in a long time. I felt as they were touching me the same survival instincts that I felt in those past moments…*just keep breathing, just stay still, this will be over soon, just fucking survive, you can do this.* Even my male talents knew we were doing powerful things and would occasionally break character and whisper sweet and encouraging things into my ear. They were such good souls, I felt so lucky (and weirdly turned on) by their kindness. The scene climaxes with the three assailants ejaculating on my face and then leaving me in a pile of cum, similar to my own trauma story.\n\nOnly this time, when my assailants got up to high five, they left the gun on the table. Without calling cut, I crawled towards the gun and truly was hyperventilating as I held it up to their backs, the camera pans close to my face as you see me physical trembling as I envisioned the face of every man who ever hurt me.\n\nThen I pulled the trigger.\n\nWhen I gripped the gun and shot, the physical catharsis in my chest was…. amazing. Every single person in the room (a half dozen people) jumped to their feet and cheered for me, clapping their hands and immediately giving me hugs and encouragement. My knees buckled underneath me from the weight of it but *it felt so fucking good.* No orgasm or physical sensation I have ever felt in porn felt better than that moment. I told my story and this time I fucking won. More than that, I won every single day I ever got out of bed in those days after my assault. I win every day I live the truth that I am not a victim but a survivor.\n\nI wonder if men who enjoy watching women being abused for misogynistic reasons will even really enjoy this scene…to me, it doesn’t really matter. I profit from them no matter what, they still must pay to access my body. My hope is that if you are a man or woman who has suffered from trauma and who feels shame about continuing to masturbate to consensual non-consent scenes, that you will feel joy when you watch this scene. At the very least you will feel no guilt because this was not a story of abuse but of victory. Every day that a woman gets paid (a lot of money, actually) to do a scene like this is a story of victory. We choose, our choice is our constant happiness. There’s such a sensation of power and joy in flipping these power dynamics on their head and turning the tables. Please do not feel guilty for enjoying it with us. If you do watch the movie when it comes out, please let me know your thoughts.\n",

Kids are there routinely but are generally respectful, and I'm cool with kids.\n\n\nOur favorite thing to do on my days off is to grab a bottle of wine and go chill in the hot tub late at night. We work together, frequently at home, so sometimes it feels like we're always at work. our late nights are one of those times we love to unwind and talk about stuff that ISN'T work related.\n\n\nWhen we got to the pool last night, it was kind of chilly. Low sixties. Enough that I was shivering a little before I climbed in the hot tub. I noticed ten yards from us was a young couple maybe 25ish, our age, who were cuddled up and watching something on their phone. At this point it's 9:30/10 so we're the only ones there. I then hear a very familiar screech and realize they have a very small infant (like not walking yet but able to hold head up) sitting away from them in a stroller.\n\n\nIt is cold, late, and this baby is in a thin cotton onesie with no blanket and is clearly distressed. The baby is making fussy noises that equate to either \"I'm tired\" or \"I need a titty\" (don't we all?) and this fucking couple is LAUGHING at their kid's distress! They were cooing \"aw what's a matter??\" And then going back to hunching over their cell phone like little goblins. Clearly what's a matter is that it has some inconsiderate-ass parents.\n\n\nThe baby's very reasonable fussing now escalates into full heartbroken wails. The kid is exhausted, cold, and hungry. I'm actually pissed for the baby, moreso than I am about the disturbance. People actually walk out onto their balconies that adjoin this area to shoot disapproving looks at this couple. It's just fucking cruel to keep a kid out like that and then have the audacity to ignore them. They finally left after a good fifteen minutes of the baby's tantrum, not because the baby was fussy I suspect, but because people were staring. Why are you out late keeping your kid awake just so you can sit on your phone when you can fucking do that at home where your baby can be warm and asleep like it needs? I get that you need your \"me time\" as a couple but it just seemed totally inappropriate.\n\n\nAm I an asshole for thinking like this?\n\nTl;Dr: asshole parents ignore their cold, hungry, tired baby at a pool in order to watch cell phone videos late at night, mystifying the whole block as to why they weren't doing it at home.",

Is there anything I need to know about this particular substrain of labs? I've never had one before, but she's obviously got a different build than any lab I've ever had -- small (she's maybe 25lb right now, and I suspect she'll get up to 40ish), compact, beautiful bone structure, but built for hunting in swamps and marshes through brush.\n\n\nI've never properly rescued a dog before but always adopted from friends' litters and whatnot but wanted to adopt this time from a shelter instead. There's a few things about her that I'm worried about --\n\nI get the impression that she spent most of her adolescence in a cage at a kill shelter in a small county here and was never exposed much to the outdoors or nature. Will she naturally know what plants to eat when we're outside (weeds, grass, etc.) or will I need to prevent her from doing that?\n\n\nShe's very visibly intelligent, but will I need to train an abused dog differently than a regular one? I picked up a stick in the backyard earlier to play fetch with her and she immediately tucked her tail between her legs and went into submissive stance. I don't want to traumatize her further by giving her corporal punishment, even though (very mild) corporal punishment, praise, and consistency was the kind of training my family used to on all of their very happy and well-behaved indoor and working dogs. I have no clue how to train a dog without the traditional \"Good behavior=praise/treats, bad behavior=scolding/newspaper.\" Are there any resources or advice y'all can offer on training abused dogs in specific?\n\n\nOne thing about her that's great is that she showed absolutely no aggression and has largely been a good sport about going new places unlike a lot of rescues. I actually wondered if she was mute until the repairman knocked on the door this afternoon and she gave a few warning barks. She gave two warning snaps to a german shepherd who was being aggressive with her at the dog park but otherwise has been friendly, if a bit shy, to every dog and person she meets.\n\n***Tl;dr*** How do I make sure that my abused rescue who's spent most of her life in a cage gets the happiest life I can give her in terms of training and socialization?",

So I'm a researcher and I wound up with an incredible opportunity with my school to go answer some questions about the Yucatan Caste War. I land in Campeche, in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and I'm planning on hiking/bussing/taxi'ing my way across the state and interviewing Mayans about the last phases of the war in the 40's before the last of the elders pass away.\n\n\nSo for short stints (maybe no more than 3-4 days of transit time) I'll be doing some combo of most likely busses and legging it through the rainforest to reach some of the more remote villages. I'm not really an experienced camper but I'm quite fit and pretty resourceful. It's around 100 degrees every day there and either overcast or light showers this season.\n\n\nI'm trying to pack as light as possible so I have a Hennessey jungle hammock (+ rainfly + mosquito net) and a 45 liter osprey kyte pack I'm just putting the bare necessities in but I'm nervous as fuck. I've spent a fair amount of time in the rainforest so I kinda know what to expect, but I've never had to camp in it before and I'm worried I may not know what to look out for necessarily and/or that I'm way too big of a pussy for this.\n\n\nSo tell me reddit, what was your experiences in the rainforest/jungle like?
