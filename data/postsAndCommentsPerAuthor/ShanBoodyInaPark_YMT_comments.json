It’s a gift because (I hope you know) that a decrease in libido is likely to happen to people at some point in their life for a variety of reasons. It’s a curse because (like you’ve experienced) many people will brush it off and say “it happens to almost everyone, don’t worry about it.” But, you have every right to be upset and to want solutions for you, so kudos to you for not giving up! I often say that desire ebbs and flows between being a rollercoaster, where you just sit back and enjoy the thrills, or a push-cart where you have to manually move every inch yourself. It sounds like you’re going through a push-cart phase and knowing that is half the battle so take all the standard advice you can to see what works, but also I’d like to try a different formula that I recently read about that I thought was interesting! To jump start your drive again, see if this helps: 1) take sex off the table for 30 days with both your partner and yourself \\*poof pressure gone\\* 2) Set an intention for at least 15 minutes of touch each day that is pleasurable but not necessarily arousing 3) Both you and your partner(s) need to do something separate and exciting just for you once a week 4) Start sexting... every chance you get and start talking about sex any chance you get. This creates an environment designed to help you get sexually charged and frustrated (a winning combo) + it gives you time to reflect on your sexual fantasies and untapped desires. Again, there’s no one-size-fits-all suggestion to solving the libido conundrum, but there are a lot of tried and tested options so have fun finding what works for you.",

Meaning your brain might be interested in engaging in sex before your body gets the memo. However, it’s also important to acknowledge that arousal isn’t linear or one-size-fits all and it’s possible that you haven’t found your size yet.

But they should get tested for HIV at least once if they’ve never been tested. \n\nFor men who have sex with men, they should get swabs of the throat and rectum (if they are having oral/anal sex), blood tests for HIV and syphilis, and a urine test for gonorrhea/chlamydia, at least once a year, but if you have multiple partners, then every 3 months is a good idea.  \n\nFinally, for transgender folks, they should get testing similar to men who have sex with men, so swabs of the throat and rectum, urine testing, and blood for HIV/syphilis.  \n\nIf you’re thinking about testing, I encourage you to go for it!  It’s easy/painless, and you’ll feel relieved to know that you’re taking care of your sexual health.  If you need to find a place, go to [www.yesmeanstest.org](http://www.yesmeanstest.org/).

I may be biased but I think it’s THE MOST interesting, rewarding and expansive vocation. I’ll answer all of your questions: \n\nWhat is your #1 advice when it comes to studying/notes/books?    \nGoogle Drive!!! Use folders and sub-folders and keep all of your work organized by topics/ classes etc. Whatever you can do to remember where different information is because you’re going to LOVE yourself down the line when you can easily access your own intellectual property to reference as you go along. Also, listen to audiobooks whenever you can and use the notes section so you can tag parts you like. If you loved the audiobook buy the physical and dog tag the pages you liked. I found I could consume a lot more information when I had both audio and physical books to tag team each other. \n\nWhat to do when you feel like you could be doing more?    \nExcellent question. I could always be doing LESS social media scrolling smh so I could do more of the insane workload I have. If you’re going to be a public-facing sex educator and social media becomes a part of your business, invest in a social media manager as fast as you can because that thing is an attention blackhole. \n\nWhat is the most harmful way of discourse when it comes to talking about sex/sexual health and how does one improve?   \nI think the most harmful way is the prideful way. Even the leading experts in this field are learning new things every day, so never be too prideful to be corrected. I am very grateful to have access to much smarter people than me in this space so that I can adjust with the findings.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia can be passed to the baby during birth and infect the eyes, syphilis can reach the babies bones, skin and brain.

It’s so important to get tested, especially as early as possible during pregnancy.  If you need to find a place to get testing, visit [www.yesmeanstest.org](http://www.yesmeanstest.org/)",
