There are so many things I could write about here – when I was fresh out of college I had no idea how hard it was going to be to simply exist as a woman in tech, that was actually pretty unexpected and a shock. And not just tech but also consumer and frontier tech which are less likely for women. It feels like now, it's okay to do something in fashion, parenting, women's health etc. but building a consumer network and inventing new AI is still pretty rare for women to be doing, I think only one consumer tech IPO with a woman CEO has happened (Stich Fix?). I also ended up immigrating twice for work, first to the UK to go work for Last.fm and then to the US when I decided I wanted my next company to be based here. Those were pretty unexpected hurdles and ended up learning a lot about both systems and the processes, I joke sometimes that I could go back to school for immigration law if tech doesn't work out haha. I think with both of those unexpected hurdles, grit and determination were and still are key. My grandmother was also an entrepreneur (she was one of the first women to sell pants in the fashion industry in western Canada in the late 60s/70s). She had a term for this called \"stick-to-it-ness\", meaning if you just stick to it, you can eventually cross these hurdles and she jumped over so many. That's something I internalized growing up and has had a big impact on my career, I don't give up easily even in the face of many failures. That's an essential part of jumping over hurdles. Are more recent hurdle I didn't expect (and that I was recently reflecting on) was how much I had to learn about product marketing as a founder. I'm a maker, so design and product comes naturally to me, but learning how to market the things I make, how to properly launch them so that people know about it, how to also be a voice for myself (like what I'm doing right now) where skills I really had to work on learning. I wish I'd faced some of these hurdles sooner in my career, but ahaha it's never too late to learn!",

The next episode that will come out tomorrow tackles some of this actually, Cherae talks about it from her point of view with a powerful leader in her field and we discuss it. One of the key takeaways form the episode is to not let past issues with these topics become silence, which is something that really, really resonates with me. Cherae, who is Black, talks about this from both perspectives you mention, I can only talk about it from the perspective of being a woman in tech. I've unfortunately witnessed all the imaginable things, and have a pile of #metoo moments. In my past, I really let them silence me, because I didn't feel like I could speak up, there was nobody to talk to, really – like what are you going to do, tell HR and then get fired to saying so? Or tell the non-existant HR in a startup environment? Today though, it really feels so different than it did 10 years ago or even 3 years ago. It's becoming more and more okay to speak up without being reprimanded. Like anything in business though, you have to choose your battles and decide what you want to spend your energy on and what you want to fight for, we don't have bottomless energy as humans, and I think this can wipe a lot of people out (I've certainly experienced this exhaustion), so being protective of our energy / power is important too.\n\nCherae and I are examples of founders who are building the next wave of more diverse and inclusive companies. It's super exciting that we're here, it was really hard for me to imagine when I first started my career.\n\nMy favorite surprise from This Is My Jam was probably all the B-sides of 45s I found. I used to go crate digging for 45s a lot (actually This Is My Jam was in part inspired by the singular tracks on those records), and I found so many gems – mostly at Flashback Records in London (Angel). For example, I remember the first time I put on Sly Fox's Let's Go All The Way and discovered it was an absolute banger after buying that 45 on a whim for a couple quid. You can still listen to all these jams I found here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rNpK6MTQ0GOOXoK1VsrN2?si=HRVGBSheQo6tG83hioJRQg\n\nYou can also still use thisismyjam.com to find a Spotify playlist for any user.
