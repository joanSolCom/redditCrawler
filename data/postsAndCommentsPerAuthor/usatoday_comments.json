The statisticians, working with FDA, set interim points in the study at which the Data Monitoring Council would look to see how many of those who got the vaccine (as opposed to the placebo) had gotten COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the data released on Monday show is that the majority of the 94 people who got COVID-19 were in the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reported that they were seeing 90% effectiveness, meaning it provided immunity in 90% of the people who got the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unlikely the 90% will hold once the vaccine is approved and starts being given in the real world, there are too many things that can go wrong and in a study setting you have everything as perfect as you can. But even so, it&amp;#39;s a positive outcome and a lot better than many people had expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

USA Today and others will have to report what we know and what still might change.\n\nI am more open to the possibility, however, that we could have a winner either late on election night or the next day as opposed to days or weeks as I once thought. This would occur if Joe Biden wins in a landslide and takes states such as North Carolina, Florida and Arizona that will have most of its ballots counted shortly after Election Day.\n\nThe states we will be waiting on the longest are Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which do not allow election officials to begin processing ballots until Election day, and Michigan, which gets only a 10-hour head-start.\n\nTrump would have little or even no path if Biden wins Florida and Arizona. (Again, we should know those winners by the morning of Nov. 4, unless it is extremely close.)\n\nConversely, Biden would still have life if Trump were to carry Florida and Arizona.

USA Today and others will have to report what we know and what still might change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am more open to the possibility, however, that we could have a winner either late on election night or the next day as opposed to days or weeks as I once thought. This would occur if Joe Biden wins in a landslide and takes states such as North Carolina, Florida and Arizona that will have most of its ballots counted shortly after Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The states we will be waiting on the longest are Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which do not allow election officials to begin processing ballots until Election day, and Michigan, which gets only a 10-hour head-start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump would have little or even no path if Biden wins Florida and Arizona. (Again, we should know those winners by the morning of Nov. 4, unless it is extremely close.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Biden would still have life if Trump were to carry Florida and Arizona.

And it's a lot more fun to dig in during the week and dissect matchups, trends and the like. It seems like in the MLB and NBA, whatever drama might be happening almost always overshadows the actual games, especially ahead of the playoffs. I mean even in the NBA, it's all about Giannis' future right now, yeah? I mean, that's great ... but Tom Brady's future after the Patriots lost in January was a hot topic for a day before we moved back to the playoffs. I don't know ...

And it&amp;#39;s a lot more fun to dig in during the week and dissect matchups, trends and the like. It seems like in the MLB and NBA, whatever drama might be happening almost always overshadows the actual games, especially ahead of the playoffs. I mean even in the NBA, it&amp;#39;s all about Giannis&amp;#39; future right now, yeah? I mean, that&amp;#39;s great ... but Tom Brady&amp;#39;s future after the Patriots lost in January was a hot topic for a day before we moved back to the playoffs. I don&amp;#39;t know ...

I'm writing about this very debate in a story now about teachers unions that are negotiating the work rules around online learning with districts. Many unions don't' want teachers to have to record their lessons for kids to watch later, because of privacy. By the same token, a lot of districts dumped Zoom in the spring because of privacy -- teachers peeking into kids' homes and what-not. Here's what I've observed: The best, most engaged learning I witnessed this spring were of live lessons where teachers were using all kinds of tricks to engage students: Asking them quick questions and having them answer in the live chat box. Brief brain breaks by having them pick a number between 1-20 (then the teacher asked his Alexa to name a number between one and 20) to see who \"won,\" then moving on in the lesson. The stuff that kids told me didn't work: \"Go watch this video out there made by someone else and then write a response.\" Yuck. From grade school to high school, kids told me that was lousy and they didn't like it and weren't motivated. I think teachers/teachers unions are going to have to get more comfortable allowing kids to access their lessons later, if they can't jump on live. Perhaps a compromise is to then destroy those recorded lessons a week or 10 days later, so they don't live on and on online somewhere.",

Those guys played a ton in 2019 and Trask has already announced himself as an all-conference guy. If we’re picking guys who have already played well but will take the next step, UNC QB Sam Howell will be viewed as CFB’s best QB in 2021. Clemson WR Joe Ngata is a guy to watch in that offense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I&amp;#39;ve been working with that for most patients.  I agree though, we need to make sure we are keeping docs and nurses safe.  Our healthcare systems are only as good as they are.  &lt;em&gt;-Dr. Cioe Pena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We chatted with a cruise historian about coronavirus and they told us that because the cruise industry has such a presence in the outbreak area that this is different than past illnesses such as SARS and bird flu, though those are the most comparable examples he could give. \n\nCLIA (Cruise Lines International Association) has issued some precautions and increased screening measures for all their member ships (which make up about 90% of ocean-going cruises). Some specific lines have added other measures as well. For more information you can check out our article here: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/07/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-more-ships-prompt-more-screening/4689340002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/07/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-more-ships-prompt-more-screening/4689340002/)\n\nSince this is an evolving situation, those precautions are subject to change, too- CLIA made that clear when issuing those measures. \n\nAs for quarantining, I'm not sure about disembarking as an alternative. Passengers that contracted coronavirus on Diamond Princess did disembark to receive treatment and further evaluation if they tested positive, which a doctor told us was a good measure to take. However, some officials have said that the quarantine didn't stop transmission, even though it wasn't an unreasonable plan to implement.\n\nMore here on how the industry is handling it: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/11/coronavirus-cruise-ships-what-does-mean-cruisers/4625691002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/11/coronavirus-cruise-ships-what-does-mean-cruisers/4625691002/)\n\nMore here on Diamond Princess and the quarantine: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/17/coronavirus-official-explains-diamond-princess-cruise-quarantine-fail/4785290002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/17/coronavirus-official-explains-diamond-princess-cruise-quarantine-fail/4785290002/)\n\nAnd on quarantines in general: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/17/coronavirus-can-quarantines-lockdowns-and-isolation-stop-charge/4784396002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/17/coronavirus-can-quarantines-lockdowns-and-isolation-stop-charge/4784396002/)\n\n\\-Morgan",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=\"/u/messingaroundatwork\"&gt;u/messingaroundatwork&lt;/a&gt;, the situation is kind of unprecedented for the cruise industry. We chatted with a cruise historian about coronavirus and they told us that because the cruise industry has such a presence in the outbreak area that this is different than past illnesses such as SARS and bird flu, though those are the most comparable examples he could give. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CLIA (Cruise Lines International Association) has issued some precautions and increased screening measures for all their member ships (which make up about 90% of ocean-going cruises). Some specific lines have added other measures as well. For more information you can check out our article here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/07/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-more-ships-prompt-more-screening/4689340002/\"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/07/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-more-ships-prompt-more-screening/4689340002/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this is an evolving situation, those precautions are subject to change, too- CLIA made that clear when issuing those measures. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for quarantining, I&amp;#39;m not sure about disembarking as an alternative. Passengers that contracted coronavirus on Diamond Princess did disembark to receive treatment and further evaluation if they tested positive, which a doctor told us was a good measure to take. However, some officials have said that the quarantine didn&amp;#39;t stop transmission, even though it wasn&amp;#39;t an unreasonable plan to implement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More here on how the industry is handling it: &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/11/coronavirus-cruise-ships-what-does-mean-cruisers/4625691002/\"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/11/coronavirus-cruise-ships-what-does-mean-cruisers/4625691002/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More here on Diamond Princess and the quarantine: &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/17/coronavirus-official-explains-diamond-princess-cruise-quarantine-fail/4785290002/\"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/02/17/coronavirus-official-explains-diamond-princess-cruise-quarantine-fail/4785290002/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on quarantines in general: &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/17/coronavirus-can-quarantines-lockdowns-and-isolation-stop-charge/4784396002/\"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/17/coronavirus-can-quarantines-lockdowns-and-isolation-stop-charge/4784396002/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Morgan&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I&amp;#39;m sorry if I didn&amp;#39;t meet your expectations but I will do my best to answer more of these questions over the next few days. I provide links to articles with the hope that it will provide extra context that I can&amp;#39;t provide in such a short window of time. Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Despite what has transpired over the last two months of the impeachment inquiry, lawmakers are pretty much sticking to partisan lines on this. We're already seeing both GOP and Democratic campaigns using impeachment in ad-messaging and on the trail.

But they will still be too far behind in the playoff push once Williamson returns. Two, Mavs coach Rick Carlisle knows how to maximize his talent. Third, Luka Doncic should build off his spectacular rookie season. - Mark&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

But oftentimes cities actively recruit immigrants to replace the population loss they've suffered in recent decades. In Dayton, Ohio, for example, which was hit hard by lost manufacturing jobs that led to a massive loss of population, the very top of the city's website reads \"Immigrant Friendly City\" and features a giant seal that reads \"Certified Welcoming.\" City leaders say those strategies have worked to revitalize those cities.

In Dayton, Ohio, for example, which was hit hard by lost manufacturing jobs that led to a massive loss of population, the very top of the city&amp;#39;s website reads &amp;quot;Immigrant Friendly City&amp;quot; and features a giant seal that reads &amp;quot;Certified Welcoming.&amp;quot; City leaders say those strategies have worked to revitalize those cities.

When I travel in Mexico, I often meet Mexicans concerned about the rampant Americanization of their country. I've also met educated people worried that the U.S. would like to take over Mexico. The U.S. also has a long history of meddling in the political and economic affairs of Latin America for it's own interests, and many experts would argue that part of the reason people are fleeing those countries are because of the problems of inequality the U.S. either helped create or looked the other way. The better solution might be for the U.S. to help those countries root out deeply embedded corruption, which would help stabilize governments, and improve standards of living and increase economic opportunities so people wouldn't have to leave.  --Daniel Gonzalez",
