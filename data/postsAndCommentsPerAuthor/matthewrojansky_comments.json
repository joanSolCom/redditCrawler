Even in the West, foreign policy is a pretty elite-dominated space. But in Russia that is 100% the case. Therefore the parties at interest in formulating Russian foreign policy are essentially the various rings and layers of influencers around Putin in the first place. That includes but is not limited to his formal cabinet (PM, Foreign minister, Defense Minister, deputy ministers, etc), his own advisors (the presidential administration has a foreign policy and security team), the top figures in the legislative bodies (the Duma and the Federation Council) and, to a much lesser extent, the relevant committees of those bodies, the intelligence services (especially the SVR, successor to the part of the KGB where Putin himself worked, plus the military spy agency GRU), and finally the oligarchs (more so Putin’s oligarchic retainers, those who came to power with him and converted that power to massive wealth, rather than the older Yeltsin-era oligarchs, who maintain cordial relations with the Kremlin but should not be thought of as policy influencers on big issues).  \n\nI don’t see Putin’s positions changing much with a potential new administration in the US. I think the point of the last 4 years has been that Russia wants what it wants--or more accurately, opposes what it opposes--and will do what it considers necessary to keep the US from getting in its way. So what may change if Biden pursues a more active US policy in the Eurasian region is that the US and Russia may come into more significant and frequent conflict. And this may not be limited to the Eurasian region, though there has been plenty of US-Russia tension in the past 4 years over Syria, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, etc. In sum, I think it could easily be more of what we saw in the Bush and Obama years following Russia’s wars with Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014): lots of small flare-ups which both sides try to keep from escalating into something much worse.",

I think the point of the last 4 years has been that Russia wants what it wants--or more accurately, opposes what it opposes--and will do what it considers necessary to keep the US from getting in its way. So what may change if Biden pursues a more active US policy in the Eurasian region is that the US and Russia may come into more significant and frequent conflict. And this may not be limited to the Eurasian region, though there has been plenty of US-Russia tension in the past 4 years over Syria, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, etc. In sum, I think it could easily be more of what we saw in the Bush and Obama years following Russia’s wars with Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014): lots of small flare-ups which both sides try to keep from escalating into something much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

First, what should be considered mainstream news in the USA is really changing. At one time it was just the 3 main TV networks and a couple of national newspapers. Now, I think if you were to omit websites like Vox or Politico, plus literally dozens of cable channels, and social media, you would really be missing where much of the country gets its news. In Russia it is a bit easier, since the dividing line is basically between state-run media, which generally speak from the same talking points, and a small but energetic zone of independent online publications.\n\nSecond, a lot of the frustration I have with news coverage on Russia topics in the USA and US news in Russia is about the tone or the selectivity of the reporting. In the US, we mostly read stories that fit into a couple of basic categories: red versus blue (the Russians versus NATO, America, Ukraine, whoever else) and we are clearly expected to “root” for blue; look at the crazy Russians (these are often travel-based stories, where reporters go outside of Moscow and tell us about how nutty or miserable life is in the “real” Russia); or Putin is up to something (some new or perhaps not new angle on something related to Putin and corruption, murder, money laundering, drugs, you name it). I find these stories not very illuminating and quickly tire of them.\n\nOn the Russian side, I feel like a lot of the coverage of the US engages in schadenfreude. Sure, it may report on events happening in America (a school shooting, a drug epidemic, income inequality, racial tensions, a natural disaster), and sure, the basic facts may even be accurate. But the tone is very often, look how terrible America is! We are much better, they do not deserve their position of leadership in the world. As you can guess, I don’t consider that a very productive approach. And I haven’t even mentioned the outright false or threatening editorial opinion journalism on both sides.

We expressed a rather nuanced concurrence with history’s most (mis)quoted geographer, but also explained how the matter is seen from the heart of Eurasia itself. Suffice to say, it’s not so much about control as it is about benefits--who sets the terms of engagement between Eurasia’s big players?  That is where China and Russia have, for now, a modus vivendi.  The question is whether that can last, and I doubt that it can.\n\nAs for New START, this is probably the single most important topic now on the US-Russia agenda. [Take a look at this piece](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no-50-arms-control-covid-19-era-no-next-step-without-new-start), fresh of the virtual press, from BG Peter Zwack, ret. who actually served as the top US military officer at our embassy in Moscow when the treaty was being implemented.  He cites good evidence that New START is not only in the clear national interest of both sides, and that it is being observed by both sides, but that without it as a foundation, another agreement is likely not possible.  So, I’d pose the question this way: with so much at stake, and the current situation far from ideal but much better than having no constraints on nuclear arsenals and no transparency, why wouldn’t we extend the treaty for another 5 years?  In that time, we could begin negotiations in earnest toward a replacement, which might then bring in other types of weapons that are not covered under the current language (e.g. space weapons, hyper-sonics, even cyber systems) and we might even be able to engage other nuclear powers, like China, Britain and France, to make it a multilateral deal.  That’s a tall order, and it sure isn’t going to happen if the US and Russia signal they don’t care enough even to preserve the deal they have now.  Another consideration is the 2020 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).  The basic bargain of that agreement is that non-nuclear weapons states agree to forego arms in exchange for access to peaceful nuclear technology, and a promise from the nuclear weapons states (there are only 5 of them officially under the treaty: USA, Russia, China, UK and France) to move toward nuclear disarmament.  I don’t imagine the response of the rest of the world to an abandonment of New START will be very positive, and it could actually signal the death of the NPT regime as well, with all the risks of a nightmare of cascading nuclear proliferation that entails.  As for a new US administration, I would guess that if the treaty does not get extended before January 2021, it would be a top priority for the next team.  But there are no guarantees in diplomacy, as in life, and I don’t rule out that something else happens before then to derail even that possibility.  Scary thought, but we live in unpredictable times.",

Here is an example:\n\n[The Wartime Donbas Economy: Can It Be Saved?](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/wartime-donbas-economy-can-it-be-saved)\n\nWe will definitely continue to organize such events, either online or when we can all get back to the Institute, which we hope will be soon. Meanwhile, I agree it’s very important that this bloody and still ongoing conflict in the very heart of Europe must be stopped. I’m afraid it is a bad sign that the pandemic has not significantly reduced the fighting. It suggests to me that the window for a settlement which may have existed last year, has already closed.",

For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/book-talk-chernobyl-the-history-nuclear-catastrophe\"&gt;Book Talk: Chernobyl: The History of a Nuclear Catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/audio/kennanx-podcast-episode-1meltdown\"&gt;KennanX Podcast Episode 1:&amp;quot;Meltdown&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we have hosted many events focusing on Crimea and the Donbas since 2014, including very recently before the pandemic.  Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/wartime-donbas-economy-can-it-be-saved\"&gt;The Wartime Donbas Economy: Can It Be Saved?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will definitely continue to organize such events, either online or when we can all get back to the Institute, which we hope will be soon. Meanwhile, I agree it’s very important that this bloody and still ongoing conflict in the very heart of Europe must be stopped. I’m afraid it is a bad sign that the pandemic has not significantly reduced the fighting. It suggests to me that the window for a settlement which may have existed last year, has already closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

These are really important historical questions, to which there are not necessarily satisfying answers. That is one reason why historians don’t much like engaging “counterfactuals,” i.e. “what if X instead of Y….”  That said, let me recommend the excellent work of [Dr. Jim Goldgeier of American University](https://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/jgoldgei.cfm) on this topic. His work is based on the most recent declassified documents, and generally tells a story as follows: During the George HW Bush years, the US did not look to actively enlarge NATO, though even by 1992/93 it was clear that some former Warsaw Pact countries were interested, and that Russia would oppose this. So in this sense, neither NATO enlargement nor Russian membership/partnership were on the table. But by the Clinton years, the US view began to shift, in part because of domestic politics and skillful diplomacy by the Central/East European states themselves, and in part because of some very serious miscommunication between the US and Russian leadership. One variant that was quite seriously considered but ultimately left by the wayside, was to pursue a more inclusive “partnership for peace” rather than NATO enlargement per se, and to include Russia in this partnership. I don’t have time or space to get into the details here, but suffice to say, that did not happen, and instead Russia found itself very much on the outside looking in. The other side of the story--which should not be missed--is that NATO enlargement and EU accession afterwards provided most of the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe with the only really iron-clad assurances of their future security and prosperity, which in turn required them to fully commit to democratic and free market principles. Some of that commitment is breaking down now, more than two decades later, but overall I would say it was a real win for Europe and the United States, and even for Russia, at the time.\n\nI’ve got to get to other questions so on Syria, let me just say this. The risk of direct conflict between US and Russian forces is real. But there is at least a “deconfliction” channel in place whereby each side is supposed to notify the other about operations where they could potentially come into close contact. So far it has worked well. There was a very well documented case of [Russian military contractors, apparently operating alongside local forces, who came under direct fire from US forces acting in self-defense](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html). While the Russian government was clearly not pleased and disputes the US account, it did draw a distinction between activities by private contractors and the Russian military itself. Either way, this should be a lesson about the risks, and that more communication is needed to contain and reduce them.",
