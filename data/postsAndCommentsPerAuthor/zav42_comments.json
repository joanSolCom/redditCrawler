See my other posting about mission content development ... let me quote it: \n\nMany things going on at once\n\n- We are adding new generic missions and improve on those that are there with more text and better balanced gameplay. \n-  We improve the mission guidance system by having better UI elements that show you what to do and better objective display (not just in the corner). This is actually a big task which again might continue beyond just 3.0\n\n- We also have plans for a new “mail” system which will be used in addition to the logbook and briefings to help you better organise what is going on doing missions (again possibly beyond 3.0)\n\n- We will add new sources for generic missions on and around stations. Especially the NPCs on stations will often offer missions when you talk to them.\n\n- And most importantly we add longer stories with more depth. Special characters, special activities etc.",

This is actually a big task which again might continue beyond just 3.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have plans for a new “mail” system which will be used in addition to the logbook and briefings to help you better organise what is going on doing missions (again possibly beyond 3.0)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will add new sources for generic missions on and around stations. Especially the NPCs on stations will often offer missions when you talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And most importantly we add longer stories with more depth. Special characters, special activities etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "phew.. this is huge, but I saw a few of these already prior on the egosoft forum and prepared a few answers ;)\n\n- With advent of the second DLC release, is there a possibility that they break habit and work on a third, possibly Boron related DLC?\n\nWe really do not know yet. I have said it before: If we add the Boron, then we want to do it right and that means it is not going to be easy. Character animations (totally different physiology), environments (under water) and also quite unique ships all mean a lot of new experiments. So no promises right now.\n\n\n- Can we get a revamp on the character designs?\n\nWe are constantly improving characters. Our character design expert Damiaan is currently working on a completely new setup to produce a wider and better looking set of characters and also improve animations. All of this is a constantly happening and will continue also after 3.0.\n\n- Will you improve the Player HQ functionality? For instance, Research shouldn't be so easy and light on functionality, the HQ model should be \"completable\" (instead of its permanent chunky unfinished appearance), and should be considered a threat for some factions maybe?\n\nYes absolutely. The new 3.0 plot also includes a lot of improvements around research and the HQ in general. Your criticism about the HQ design however is something else, the idea with the HQ is that it is a cool and unique relict station with special features that make it very valuable for the player. How you then design it and build on it however is intentionally left to the player.\n\n- The current universe is kind of boring visual-vise. I'm aware that the Split DLC will bring at least one cool looking system with the Blackhole consuming the sun thing (Blackhole Sun - what a missed opportunity there!), but could we also get a revamp on the original vanilla cluster/sector visuals?\n\nAgain: I hope the Split Expansion video shows you already where we are going. Yes there will also be new systems in the base game and indirectly we also always improve these. However we have no plan to do a complete redesign of the environments of the existing base game as that would not be possible in a savegame compatible expansion.\n\n- How are you going to revamp the Mission system?\n\nI had posted this answer before: \nMany things going on at once:\nWe are adding new generic missions and improve on those that are there with more text and better balanced gameplay. \nWe improve the mission guidance system by having better UI elements that show you what to do and better objective display (not just in the corner). This is actually a big task which again might continue beyond just 3.0\nWe also have plans for a new “mail” system which will be used in addition to the logbook and briefings to help you better organise what is going on doing missions (again possibly beyond 3.0)\nWe will add new sources for generic missions on and around stations. Especially the NPCs on stations will often offer missions when you talk to them.\nAnd most importantly we add longer stories with more depth. Special characters, special activities etc. \n\n\n\n- How are you going to handle the aforementioned story plot missions (regarding the dynamic nature and uncertain outcomes of the game)?\n\nIt really works like a puzzle. There are individual chains that sometimes have connections to each other (e.g using the same character / location / scenario). You as a player may not always be able to play all missions, and they are not all in a fixed linear order though.\n\n- Are you ever going to finish up the ingame Encyclopedia, and if not planned, is there a possibility for us players to help to fill it?\n\nAgain this is an area that is constantly being improved. We are adding a lot more content already. \n\nWe have made bad experiences with opening up game content too much for the community in the past but more than willing to try: Any fans who feel they are competent authors can contact us \n\n-  Are there plans for addressing the map's awkward post-deep space exploration state (stays super out-zoomed)?\n\nThe fact that the map zooms dynamically and per system is definitely not going to change. There was a bug in a previous version where some ships strayed off way too far away from systems and thereby making the map zoom out too much. Unfortunately it is hard for us to tell retroactively where this might have been caused by  bug and where it was intentional exploration.\n\n- Is there a possibility of rethinking the Encounters/Deep space exploration mechanism?\n\nWe are improving it by adding more variety and integrating it better but I still believe that this mechanism in general is good. \n\n- Are you going to reconsider adding Jumpdrive back?\n\nNo. Jumpdrive does not fit with the rest of the game mechanics. It would be easy to add of course, but it makes all strategy obsolete. The idea is that in late games scenarios, while the player can move around inside his fleet almost completely free (thanks to teleportation), the ships can not suddenly move “behind obstacles”.\n\n- Can we expect more end-game content? (eg, dynamic race relations, factions responding more aggressively to player actions, full-scale galactic war(s), new threats [could even be a new faction or a more advanced Xenon branch])?\n\nMore end game content: YES, very much so. This is our main focus for 3.0 and beyond.\n\nDynamic race relations: Again YES this is what we want to build up on a lot more. X4 is a great foundation in this regard. I believe dynamic faction relations have a lot of potential and are also our best way to allow the universe to be modified into the direction each player prefers (more war? more peace? etc.)\n\n- Are you going to improve the Kha'ak any time?\n\nWe have just worked on the Khaak balancing very recently (as part of 3.0 internally). This is not yet anything new (as in new ships or other assets), but we wanted to make them more true to the original Khaak from X2. \n\n- Can we expect NPC Training Centers/Seminar functionality added or utilized?\n\nVersion 3.0  will bring a rebalance of NPC learning as well as a method of applying seminars to individual NPCs. No plan for training centres like in X3. The idea is that the masses gain their XP through actions (as they do already just in some cases quicker), while the best ones are manually taught even further. Of course the star scale is exponetial, so gaining full 5 stars is still very very hard.\n\n- Also, can we expect hireable NPCs with randomized skill-sets?\nThey are already, just on a lower level. \n\nAgain the scale is not linear. The masses of NPCs are in the zero to two star area and this is of course intentional. We want to make the really well trained captain or manager really valuable\n\n- Are you going to touch-up on the balance of ships/turrets?\n\nWe are always working on all balancing a little but there are no plans for a major rebalancing at this point.",

For instance, Research shouldn&amp;#39;t be so easy and light on functionality, the HQ model should be &amp;quot;completable&amp;quot; (instead of its permanent chunky unfinished appearance), and should be considered a threat for some factions maybe?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes absolutely. The new 3.0 plot also includes a lot of improvements around research and the HQ in general. Your criticism about the HQ design however is something else, the idea with the HQ is that it is a cool and unique relict station with special features that make it very valuable for the player. How you then design it and build on it however is intentionally left to the player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The current universe is kind of boring visual-vise. I&amp;#39;m aware that the Split DLC will bring at least one cool looking system with the Blackhole consuming the sun thing (Blackhole Sun - what a missed opportunity there!), but could we also get a revamp on the original vanilla cluster/sector visuals?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again: I hope the Split Expansion video shows you already where we are going. Yes there will also be new systems in the base game and indirectly we also always improve these. However we have no plan to do a complete redesign of the environments of the existing base game as that would not be possible in a savegame compatible expansion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How are you going to revamp the Mission system?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had posted this answer before: \nMany things going on at once:\nWe are adding new generic missions and improve on those that are there with more text and better balanced gameplay. \nWe improve the mission guidance system by having better UI elements that show you what to do and better objective display (not just in the corner). This is actually a big task which again might continue beyond just 3.0\nWe also have plans for a new “mail” system which will be used in addition to the logbook and briefings to help you better organise what is going on doing missions (again possibly beyond 3.0)\nWe will add new sources for generic missions on and around stations. Especially the NPCs on stations will often offer missions when you talk to them.\nAnd most importantly we add longer stories with more depth. Special characters, special activities etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How are you going to handle the aforementioned story plot missions (regarding the dynamic nature and uncertain outcomes of the game)?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really works like a puzzle. There are individual chains that sometimes have connections to each other (e.g using the same character / location / scenario). You as a player may not always be able to play all missions, and they are not all in a fixed linear order though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you ever going to finish up the ingame Encyclopedia, and if not planned, is there a possibility for us players to help to fill it?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again this is an area that is constantly being improved. We are adding a lot more content already. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have made bad experiences with opening up game content too much for the community in the past but more than willing to try: Any fans who feel they are competent authors can contact us &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Are there plans for addressing the map&amp;#39;s awkward post-deep space exploration state (stays super out-zoomed)?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that the map zooms dynamically and per system is definitely not going to change. There was a bug in a previous version where some ships strayed off way too far away from systems and thereby making the map zoom out too much. Unfortunately it is hard for us to tell retroactively where this might have been caused by  bug and where it was intentional exploration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is there a possibility of rethinking the Encounters/Deep space exploration mechanism?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are improving it by adding more variety and integrating it better but I still believe that this mechanism in general is good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you going to reconsider adding Jumpdrive back?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. Jumpdrive does not fit with the rest of the game mechanics. It would be easy to add of course, but it makes all strategy obsolete. The idea is that in late games scenarios, while the player can move around inside his fleet almost completely free (thanks to teleportation), the ships can not suddenly move “behind obstacles”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can we expect more end-game content? (eg, dynamic race relations, factions responding more aggressively to player actions, full-scale galactic war(s), new threats [could even be a new faction or a more advanced Xenon branch])?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More end game content: YES, very much so. This is our main focus for 3.0 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dynamic race relations: Again YES this is what we want to build up on a lot more. X4 is a great foundation in this regard. I believe dynamic faction relations have a lot of potential and are also our best way to allow the universe to be modified into the direction each player prefers (more war? more peace? etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you going to improve the Kha&amp;#39;ak any time?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have just worked on the Khaak balancing very recently (as part of 3.0 internally). This is not yet anything new (as in new ships or other assets), but we wanted to make them more true to the original Khaak from X2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can we expect NPC Training Centers/Seminar functionality added or utilized?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Version 3.0  will bring a rebalance of NPC learning as well as a method of applying seminars to individual NPCs. No plan for training centres like in X3. The idea is that the masses gain their XP through actions (as they do already just in some cases quicker), while the best ones are manually taught even further. Of course the star scale is exponetial, so gaining full 5 stars is still very very hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also, can we expect hireable NPCs with randomized skill-sets?\nThey are already, just on a lower level. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again the scale is not linear. The masses of NPCs are in the zero to two star area and this is of course intentional. We want to make the really well trained captain or manager really valuable&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you going to touch-up on the balance of ships/turrets?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are always working on all balancing a little but there are no plans for a major rebalancing at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In addition to that it is often also not so much the extreme station in itself (yet) that slows the game down, but the action around it. Many ships trying to dock, deliver, etc. So if you keep the station more isolated, not too busy and also not in the middle of an asteroid belt your chances are much better. At some point with these monster stations indeed  draw calls will become the problem, but even then it is  likely CPU limited again. Lastly: Do not forget about GPU memory, that always helps a lot. But you can save a lot of it by not running crazy AA settings.  (Btw. if your framerate does not go down even with 2xSSAA , then your GPU is not the limiting factor, but be careful: high SSAA settings also mean more GPU memory consumption).

That is also the reason why it attracts a lot of different audience with different wishes. So no I would definitely not say that X4 ever moved away from being a true space sim, but yes it added new aspects.  You criticise the progression curve and that is something we are always trying to fine tune.

        "body": "phew.. this is huge, but I saw a few of these already prior on the egosoft forum and prepared a few answers ;)\n\n- With advent of the second DLC release, is there a possibility that they break habit and work on a third, possibly Boron related DLC?\n\nWe really do not know yet. I have said it before: If we add the Boron, then we want to do it right and that means it is not going to be easy. Character animations (totally different physiology), environments (under water) and also quite unique ships all mean a lot of new experiments. So no promises right now.\n\n\n- Can we get a revamp on the character designs?\n\nWe are constantly improving characters. Our character design expert Damiaan is currently working on a completely new setup to produce a wider and better looking set of characters and also improve animations. All of this is a constantly happening and will continue also after 3.0.\n\n- Will you improve the Player HQ functionality? For instance, Research shouldn't be so easy and light on functionality, the HQ model should be \"completable\" (instead of its permanent chunky unfinished appearance), and should be considered a threat for some factions maybe?\n\nYes absolutely. The new 3.0 plot also includes a lot of improvements around research and the HQ in general. Your criticism about the HQ design however is something else, the idea with the HQ is that it is a cool and unique relict station with special features that make it very valuable for the player. How you then design it and build on it however is intentionally left to the player.\n\n- The current universe is kind of boring visual-vise. I'm aware that the Split DLC will bring at least one cool looking system with the Blackhole consuming the sun thing (Blackhole Sun - what a missed opportunity there!), but could we also get a revamp on the original vanilla cluster/sector visuals?\n\nAgain: I hope the Split Expansion video shows you already where we are going. Yes there will also be new systems in the base game and indirectly we also always improve these. However we have no plan to do a complete redesign of the environments of the existing base game as that would not be possible in a savegame compatible expansion.\n\n- How are you going to revamp the Mission system?\n\nI had posted this answer before: \nMany things going on at once:\nWe are adding new generic missions and improve on those that are there with more text and better balanced gameplay. \nWe improve the mission guidance system by having better UI elements that show you what to do and better objective display (not just in the corner). This is actually a big task which again might continue beyond just 3.0\nWe also have plans for a new “mail” system which will be used in addition to the logbook and briefings to help you better organise what is going on doing missions (again possibly beyond 3.0)\nWe will add new sources for generic missions on and around stations. Especially the NPCs on stations will often offer missions when you talk to them.\nAnd most importantly we add longer stories with more depth. Special characters, special activities etc. \n\n\n\n- How are you going to handle the aforementioned story plot missions (regarding the dynamic nature and uncertain outcomes of the game)?\n\nIt really works like a puzzle. There are individual chains that sometimes have connections to each other (e.g using the same character / location / scenario). You as a player may not always be able to play all missions, and they are not all in a fixed linear order though.\n\n- Are you ever going to finish up the ingame Encyclopedia, and if not planned, is there a possibility for us players to help to fill it?\n\nAgain this is an area that is constantly being improved. We are adding a lot more content already. \n\nWe have made bad experiences with opening up game content too much for the community in the past but more than willing to try: Any fans who feel they are competent authors can contact us \n\n-  Are there plans for addressing the map's awkward post-deep space exploration state (stays super out-zoomed)?\n\nThe fact that the map zooms dynamically and per system is definitely not going to change. There was a bug in a previous version where some ships strayed off way too far away from systems and thereby making the map zoom out too much. Unfortunately it is hard for us to tell retroactively where this might have been caused by  bug and where it was intentional exploration.\n\n- Is there a possibility of rethinking the Encounters/Deep space exploration mechanism?\n\nWe are improving it by adding more variety and integrating it better but I still believe that this mechanism in general is good. \n\n- Are you going to reconsider adding Jumpdrive back?\n\nNo. Jumpdrive does not fit with the rest of the game mechanics. It would be easy to add of course, but it makes all strategy obsolete. The idea is that in late games scenarios, while the player can move around inside his fleet almost completely free (thanks to teleportation), the ships can not suddenly move “behind obstacles”.\n\n- Can we expect more end-game content? (eg, dynamic race relations, factions responding more aggressively to player actions, full-scale galactic war(s), new threats [could even be a new faction or a more advanced Xenon branch])?\n\nMore end game content: YES, very much so. This is our main focus for 3.0 and beyond.\n\nDynamic race relations: Again YES this is what we want to build up on a lot more. X4 is a great foundation in this regard. I believe dynamic faction relations have a lot of potential and are also our best way to allow the universe to be modified into the direction each player prefers (more war? more peace? etc.)\n\n- Are you going to improve the Kha'ak any time?\n\nWe have just worked on the Khaak balancing very recently (as part of 3.0 internally). This is not yet anything new (as in new ships or other assets), but we wanted to make them more true to the original Khaak from X2. \n\n- Can we expect NPC Training Centers/Seminar functionality added or utilized?\n\nVersion 3.0  will bring a rebalance of NPC learning as well as a method of applying seminars to individual NPCs. No plan for training centres like in X3. The idea is that the masses gain their XP through actions (as they do already just in some cases quicker), while the best ones are manually taught even further. Of course the star scale is exponetial, so gaining full 5 stars is still very very hard.\n\n- Also, can we expect hireable NPCs with randomized skill-sets?\nThey are already, just on a lower level. \n\nAgain the scale is not linear. The masses of NPCs are in the zero to two star area and this is of course intentional. We want to make the really well trained captain or manager really valuable\n\n- Are you going to touch-up on the balance of ships/turrets?\n\nWe are always working on all balancing a little but there are no plans for a major rebalancing at this point.",

This is actually a big task which again might continue beyond just 3.0\n\n- We also have plans for a new “mail” system which will be used in addition to the logbook and briefings to help you better organise what is going on doing missions (again possibly beyond 3.0)\n\n- We will add new sources for generic missions on and around stations. Especially the NPCs on stations will often offer missions when you talk to them.\n\nAnd most importantly we add longer stories with more depth. Special characters, special activities etc.",

We worked on it for more than 7 years and reinvented everything from scratch. \nSecond reason however is that a lot of fans expected it to be X4: A successor of the X3 games. They are upset for example about the fact that you can only fly one ship personally, while in the X3 games you could fly almost every ship personally.  X Rebirth however was designed to be different and we did try to communicate that this is not X4.  But yeah... if you want X4 wait for X4 (we will talk about that soon).

You always play in cockpit view or 1st person (on platforms)\n\n- There is significantly less need for playing on platforms. You can still leave your ship and walk around but you wont have to do it as often. \n\n-Bernd",

As toddler may actively think about the steps for walking, a child thinks about how to talk to a person, as a young adult you think a lot about career objectives and actions needed there. But when you are in a job for a long time, even very high level things happen more and more automatically. The same process that helps you internalise simple activities like riding a bike, swimming or driving a car, ultimately also helps you internalise your entire life and then less and less is really left.

But when you are in a job for a long time, even very high level things happen more and more automatically. The same process that helps you internalise simple activities like riding a bike, swimming or driving a car, ultimately also helps you internalise your entire life and then less and less is really left.

You can actually do more things in many areas.\nTake building factories as an example, where you have much more influence on the structure and equipment of the station you build. \nFleet management was criticized a lot, because especially in the original version it was not designed to allow independent ships without any command hierarchy. We have changed that and added a much improved &amp;quot;property owned&amp;quot; menu. Now in 4.0 also this aspect should be a lot better.  But yes, there are differences and some things are not available. (e.g you can not personally steer other ships and not control capital ships from their brdige)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I hope we could make up for this at least partially by giving away the first expansion for free to all early customers and by bringing a lot of new features in the free updates even now years after release. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes I do realise that many X3 fans do not consider a game a worthy successor if you can not fly all ships (or many at least) personally and thats fair, then X Rebirth is not for you and we are working on a new game in the future that will bring that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But please do not say that this was missing from X Rebirth, because I really stressed this fact in every press text and video announcement we made about the game prior to release and afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It was a defining feature of X Rebirth from the start that this game is limited to one ship. Yes that was a limitation compared to the older X3 games, but we made that to allow us to do other things and to be able to bring such a massive game to life at all. \n\nPlease take a moment and read this [Interview](http://www.nutty-gamer.com/en/interview-egosoft/) about our plans for the future. I explain that while we are improving X Rebirth fundamentally with every major update, there are some things that just wont work without breaking the whole game. \n\nThere are new factions in Home of Light (one of them an old, somewhat infamous, race  from X2).\n\n**New ships**\nThere are several new ships. Some of them new enemies, some new small vessels. What is probably most interesting for you are the ships you can own: We focussed on new transporters, especially smaller (M size) ones. In Home of Light, also the NPC economy uses M ships a lot more for trading.  Another nice example for a new ship is the construction vessel from the Terracorp (a new faction you may know from X3) shipyard. It can build the new warehouse station.\n\n**Weapon mods**\nYou don't craft weapon, you improve them with mods. Weapon modifications are found throughout the game (e.g as rare drops from fights). They have attributes that affect primary weapon positive or negative (e.g larger range and bigger impact but slower rate). You can decide which ones you install and the rest can be \"taken apart\" to craft even more weapon mods from these parts. \n\n**Performance**\n4.0 continued what we had done with the previous updates and definitely improves on performance over older versions again. But there should not be major performance issues with X Rebirth for many versions. Can you elaborate what issues you see and what hardware you have? \n\n-Bernd",

Scientists who, among all the other areas, will develop more advanced AI quicker, than we could ever have imagined. \n\nThe kind of things that we take pride in.

A mix of both?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is at least our goal to produce everything from the economy. Balancing this however is a ... err... terrible hard job. So I better dont make too big a promise here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What tools are there to control your fleet? Are there anything like RTS controls we can utilize from the map, even just simple ones?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have posted about this at least twice in this thread.
