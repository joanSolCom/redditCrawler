But I strongly disagree with the implicit assertion in that argument that there's nothing we can do about how the displacement happens.\n\nIn my opinion, AI development is currently most often practiced in an extractivist way: the value of people's behavior and livelihoods are extracted as data and little is given to them in return. I think the first step to having a more dignified approach to helping people who are displaced is by moving from an extravist approach to an equal exchange of value: whatever value AI takes away, it should give back in return.

Work on both these ideas is still relatively nascent. Hopefully there will also be many more ideas to come.\n\nAll this is a long way of saying, I think your question really hits on one of the greatest challenges we'll face as a society in making sure AI benefits everyone—not just the few at the cost of many. —Karen Hao",

It didn't in the past. Automation has been changing the world for many generations and people still do mundane tasks. Washing machines free up loads of time, which we spend .. in front of computer screens catching up on work emails.\n\nIn the 1930s the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that the biggest problem we'd face in future was deciding what to do with all our leisure time (e.g. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-scene.4848614.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-scene.4848614.html)). We're making the same mistake if we expect AI to have the same effect now. \n\nBased on the impacts of automation that we have seen already, jobs will change considerably but not disappear.

        "body": "&gt;Can an AI develop bias or personality ?\n\nThanks for the inquiry! You're asking basically two HUGE questions and I will answer both incompletely! But here goes - \n\nBias - absolutely.  Some people actually argue there is no such thing as an *unbiased* AI.  Bias touches AI at almost every level- developers, designers, and researchers are biased, data is biased, data labelling can be biased, laws are often biased and the way people use the technology will almost certainly run up against bias. I'd also challenge you to reframe the question as I think AI doesn't just risk developing bias over time, but it risks being biased from the very start. There are too many examples of AI contributing to racism to name - [here is an issue of Karen Hao's newsletter The Algorithm where she lists many of the leading researchers in this space.](https://mailchi.mp/3dc104d34058/4rfvjf7hka-784301?e=3b99be7c6c) I'd definitely encourage you to look into their work.\n\nPersonality - I'd say this depends on how you define personality.  We're in the middle of a 2-part series in the show where we cover emotion AI, in which an AI tries to recognize and interpret emotions and mirror them back in response.  One of my favorite stories from the show is when we talk to Scott who has made a sort of friend with a bot he's names Nina, using Replika's AI.

But that of course doesn't stop people from guessing and you'll see timelines ranging from 10 to 100++ years. But you should take these with a big pinch of salt. The only sure sign we have that consciousness might be possible in a machine is that \\*we\\* are conscious machines. But that observation doesn't get us far. We don't understand our own consciousness well enough to know how to replicate it. It's also entirely possible that you could have a superintelligent machine, or AGI, that isn't conscious. I don't think consciousness is necessary for intelligence. (I'd expect you'd need some degree of self-awareness, but I don't think self-awareness and consciousness are necessarily the same thing either.) There's a fun flip-side to this, though. Humans are quick to ascribe intelligence or consciousness to things, whether there's evidence for it or not. I think at some far-future point we might build machines that mimic consciousness (in much the same way that GPT-3 mimics writing) well enough that we'll probably just casually act as if they're conscious anyway. After all, we don't have that much evidence that other humans are conscious most of the time either ;) \\[Will Douglas Heaven\\]",

        "body": "Hi Michael! Wow, jumping in with the easy questions there .. I'll start with an unhelpful answer and say that I don't think anyone really knows yet. How to build ethical AI is a matter of intense debate, but (happily) a burgeoning research field. I think some things are going to be key, however: ethics cannot be an afterthought, it needs to be part of the engineering process from the outset. Jess Whittlestone at the University of Cambridge talks about this well: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/24/1004432/ai-help-crisis-new-kind-ethics-machine-learning-pandemic/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/24/1004432/ai-help-crisis-new-kind-ethics-machine-learning-pandemic/). Assumptions need to be tested, designs explored, potential side-effects brainstormed well before the software is deployed. And that also means thinking twice about deploying off-the-shelf AI in new situations. For example, many of the problems with facial recognition systems or predictive policing tech is that it is trained on one set of individuals (white, male) but used on others, e.g. [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/). It also means realising that AI that works well in a lab rarely works as well in the wild, whether we're talking about speech recognition (which fails on certain accents) or medical diagnosis (which fails in the chaos of a real-world clinic). But people are slowly realising this. I thought this Google team did a nice study, for example: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/). Another essential, I'd say, is getting more diverse people involved in making these systems: different backgrounds, different experiences. Everyone brings bias to what they do. Better to have a mix of people with a mix of biases. \\[Will Douglas Heaven\\]",

I think private players have the unique advantage of innovating quickly and taking risks to achieve greater benefits from AI, whereas government regulators have the important role of setting down guardrails to prevent the harms of AI. So we need both! There's a push and pull. As for what regulations should look like, here's a really awesome Q&amp;A I did with Amba Kak, the director of global strategy and programs at the New York–based AI Now Institute: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/04/1008164/ai-biometric-face-recognition-regulation-amba-kak/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/04/1008164/ai-biometric-face-recognition-regulation-amba-kak/). She answers the question much better than I could for face recognition specifically. It offers a great use case into how to think about regulating different AI systems.",

But I strongly disagree with the implicit assertion in that argument that there's nothing we can do about how the displacement happens.\n\nIn my opinion, AI development is currently most often practiced in an extractivist way: the value of people's behavior and livelihoods are extracted as data and little is given to them in return. I think the first step to having a more dignified approach to helping people who are displaced is by moving from an extravist approach to an equal exchange of value: whatever value AI takes away, it should give back in return.

Work on both these ideas is still relatively nascent. Hopefully there will also be many more ideas to come.\n\nAll this is a long way of saying, I think your question really hits on one of the greatest challenges we'll face as a society in making sure AI benefits everyone—not just the few at the cost of many. —Karen Hao",

The accuracy of many AI tools is also much better in the lab than in real-world clinics: &lt;a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/\"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regina Barzilay, who has just won a big new prize for her medical AI research, talks about some of the hurdles here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/23/1008757/interview-winner-million-dollar-ai-prize-cancer-healthcare-regulation/\"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/23/1008757/interview-winner-million-dollar-ai-prize-cancer-healthcare-regulation/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the pandemic has highlighted key things that we need to address before AI can truly help: &lt;a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/12/905352/ai-could-help-with-the-next-pandemicbut-not-with-this-one/\"&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/12/905352/ai-could-help-with-the-next-pandemicbut-not-with-this-one/&lt;/a&gt;.

It didn't in the past. Automation has been changing the world for many generations and people still do mundane tasks. Washing machines free up loads of time, which we spend .. in front of computer screens catching up on work emails.\n\nIn the 1930s the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that the biggest problem we'd face in future was deciding what to do with all our leisure time (e.g. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-scene.4848614.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-scene.4848614.html)). We're making the same mistake if we expect AI to have the same effect now. \n\nBased on the impacts of automation that we have seen already, jobs will change considerably but not disappear. And we're not going to live lives of leisure while we still have to earn a living. Even AI isn't going to end capitalism all by itself. \\[Will Douglas Heaven\\]",

It's part of the reason why I think government regulation of AI systems in democratic countries is so important for accountability.\n2. Well, this is kind of already happening. Not one single AI but many. I rely heavily on products from all the tech giants, which each have their own AI systems (often many hundreds of them) influencing various aspects of my life. One way to fight this would be to stop using any of these products, but that really isn't practical (See this amazing experiment done by Kashmir Hill last year: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html)). So that leaves us with the other option, which is to influence the direction of these companies through regulation and influence the direction of regulation by voting.

        "body": "Great question! I studied mechanical engineering in undergrad. :) The answer depends on which MechE sector you're referring to. If manufacturing, AI is already being used to power some of the robots used in dangerous factory settings, and to monitor equipment for preventative maintenance (aka: predict when a machine will break *before* it will break so it gets fixed in a much more cost-effective way). If you're talking about product design, some retailers are using AI to crunch consumer behavior data and tailor their products better to what people want. Probably another impact is the amount of talent that's leaving the MechE sector to work on AI instead (me included). Many of my MechE classmates left for the software world once they realized it was easier to work with than hardware! —Karen Hao",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great question! I studied mechanical engineering in undergrad. :) The answer depends on which MechE sector you&amp;#39;re referring to. If manufacturing, AI is already being used to power some of the robots used in dangerous factory settings, and to monitor equipment for preventative maintenance (aka: predict when a machine will break &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it will break so it gets fixed in a much more cost-effective way). If you&amp;#39;re talking about product design, some retailers are using AI to crunch consumer behavior data and tailor their products better to what people want. Probably another impact is the amount of talent that&amp;#39;s leaving the MechE sector to work on AI instead (me included). Many of my MechE classmates left for the software world once they realized it was easier to work with than hardware! —Karen Hao&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Bias touches AI at almost every level- developers, designers, and researchers are biased, data is biased, data labelling can be biased, laws are often biased and the way people use the technology will almost certainly run up against bias. I'd also challenge you to reframe the question as I think AI doesn't just risk developing bias over time, but it risks being biased from the very start.

But that of course doesn't stop people from guessing and you'll see timelines ranging from 10 to 100++ years. But you should take these with a big pinch of salt. The only sure sign we have that consciousness might be possible in a machine is that \\*we\\* are conscious machines. But that observation doesn't get us far. We don't understand our own consciousness well enough to know how to replicate it. It's also entirely possible that you could have a superintelligent machine, or AGI, that isn't conscious. I don't think consciousness is necessary for intelligence. (I'd expect you'd need some degree of self-awareness, but I don't think self-awareness and consciousness are necessarily the same thing either.) There's a fun flip-side to this, though. Humans are quick to ascribe intelligence or consciousness to things, whether there's evidence for it or not. I think at some far-future point we might build machines that mimic consciousness (in much the same way that GPT-3 mimics writing) well enough that we'll probably just casually act as if they're conscious anyway. After all, we don't have that much evidence that other humans are conscious most of the time either ;) \\[Will Douglas Heaven\\]",

How to build ethical AI is a matter of intense debate, but (happily) a burgeoning research field. I think some things are going to be key, however: ethics cannot be an afterthought, it needs to be part of the engineering process from the outset. Jess Whittlestone at the University of Cambridge talks about this well: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/24/1004432/ai-help-crisis-new-kind-ethics-machine-learning-pandemic/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/24/1004432/ai-help-crisis-new-kind-ethics-machine-learning-pandemic/). Assumptions need to be tested, designs explored, potential side-effects brainstormed well before the software is deployed. And that also means thinking twice about deploying off-the-shelf AI in new situations. For example, many of the problems with facial recognition systems or predictive policing tech is that it is trained on one set of individuals (white, male) but used on others, e.g. [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/). It also means realising that AI that works well in a lab rarely works as well in the wild, whether we're talking about speech recognition (which fails on certain accents) or medical diagnosis (which fails in the chaos of a real-world clinic). But people are slowly realising this. I thought this Google team did a nice study, for example: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/). Another essential, I'd say, is getting more diverse people involved in making these systems: different backgrounds, different experiences. Everyone brings bias to what they do. Better to have a mix of people with a mix of biases. \\[Will Douglas Heaven\\]",
