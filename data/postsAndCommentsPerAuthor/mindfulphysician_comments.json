Mainly, I wish I'd had a better understanding of my own mind as I now recognize a number of mental patterns that got in the way of my being fully present with coworkers and colleagues, as well as with my family. Patterns around being an overachiever, a perfectionist, the one who had all the answers, and around self-doubt and self-criticism. Patterns that kept me in mental stories, not fully present to the richness of taking care of vulnerable patients. This may not have been the sort of answer you were expecting but, in the hundreds of physicians I've coached and taught, I've seen similar patterns that get in the way of the full career satisfaction they deserve to have.\n\nSo much of our well-being comes from the inner stories we tell ourselves, and these are often full of harsh self-judgment and criticism, expectations, and \"shoulds.\" Paying attention to our thoughts and working with our minds is key to fulfillment, replacing self-judgment with self-compassion. In other words, practicing mindfulness! \n\nObviously this is not just for physicians. So, that's the main thing I wish I'd learned earlier in my career. But I'm very grateful that I understand this more now.",

        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a great question! Quite a few things, actually. Mainly, I wish I&amp;#39;d had a better understanding of my own mind as I now recognize a number of mental patterns that got in the way of my being fully present with coworkers and colleagues, as well as with my family. Patterns around being an overachiever, a perfectionist, the one who had all the answers, and around self-doubt and self-criticism. Patterns that kept me in mental stories, not fully present to the richness of taking care of vulnerable patients. This may not have been the sort of answer you were expecting but, in the hundreds of physicians I&amp;#39;ve coached and taught, I&amp;#39;ve seen similar patterns that get in the way of the full career satisfaction they deserve to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much of our well-being comes from the inner stories we tell ourselves, and these are often full of harsh self-judgment and criticism, expectations, and &amp;quot;shoulds.&amp;quot; Paying attention to our thoughts and working with our minds is key to fulfillment, replacing self-judgment with self-compassion. In other words, practicing mindfulness! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is not just for physicians. So, that&amp;#39;s the main thing I wish I&amp;#39;d learned earlier in my career. But I&amp;#39;m very grateful that I understand this more now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It's not easy getting through med school and with a job as well, you will definitely need to pace yourself. \n\nThe key with meditation is establishing a daily routine. You want it to become something that is built into your day, just like brushing your teeth. This could be a 5-10 minute sitting practice or a walking meditation. In sitting meditation we use the breath as our \"anchor,\" the thing we bring our mind back to over and over. With walking meditation, we use our steps--the movement of our leg, the sensation of the foot touching the ground, the sensation of the body moving in space. We notice when our mind has left the present moment and is off in worry, replaying conversations, planning, etc. and we kindly bring ourselves back to the anchor point.\n\nI provide a resilience session to the second-year Internal Medicine residents at my hospital and they ask a similar question. The ones who are successful with meditation make it a fixed part of their day.\n\nAnd, even if you fall off at times, you can always start again! That's something else that's key with meditation since it's completely normal to fall off at times.\n\nI hope this is helpful to you. I wish you much success in your career!",

With mindfulness, we become more aware of what our mind is up to and realize that we have a choice about how much attention we give any particular thought. And the good news is that there is very little downside, and no side effects!\n\nAgain, I wish your friend much goodness, and greater peace of mind.",

The biggest misconception is that people say that their mind is too busy to meditate or that they tried and failed because they couldn't quiet their mind. The good news is that a busy mind provides great substrate for us to work with! In fact, meditation is not about achieving some sort of blank mind -- that would be impossible. Instead, it’s about getting to know our minds and befriending what we find. With meditation, each time we have a thought provides an opportunity to intentionally shift our attention to the anchor point of our breathing. That’s the practice that meditation provides. \n\nAnother big one is that if you don't feel instant calm, you must be doing something wrong. In fact, many times when we meditate, we can experience a variety of emotions, including sadness or anger or grief. What we're doing is simply being aware of what's present. So, instead of judging, questioning, or pushing away, we're just seeing what's going on inside us. It may be counter-intuitive but this \"being present\" with ourselves can be very restorative.",
