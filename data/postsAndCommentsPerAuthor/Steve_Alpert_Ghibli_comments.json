        "body": "So \"vetoed\" the score doesn't mean he didn't like it. When we proposed to Miyazaki that Disney let Hisaishi Joe re-do the score everyone expected Miyazaki to just say no. What he said was that Hisaishi-san had always wanted more music in the score and that at the time he had said no, but he was curious what Joe would do if given free reign (almost free reign). Disney was paying for it. \n\nWe recorded the new music for the soundtrack in Seattle and brought it back for Miyazaki to hear. He listened to it and said \"Naruhodo. Omoshiroi. Jya, dame desu ne.\" By that he didn't mean that the score was \"dame\" (not good). He meant that it wasn't approved for the about to be released English version of the film. His reason as he later explained was that any film is a product of the time in which it was created and carries with it a hint of the atmosphere of the time, including what would have been technologically possible or economically viable. He thought it would be wrong to change the ambiance of the original film by adding enhanced music. In other words, Hisaishi's new version was just another possible take on the music. Miyazaki was curious to hear what that take would be. \n\nThere is no question that he said no to including it in the version we were about to release. But he never said he didn't like the music. I genuinely have a deep respect for Hisaishi Joe and his immense talent. I am 100% sure about my claim which must be verifiable by looking at whatever version of the film that was released at the time. I can't remember if Hisaishi was actually present when we played the music for Miyazaki to get his permission. But probably Mikiko Takeda was, and Nonaka-san at Ghibli might or probably would remember if you want to fact-check me.",

Translating a book is one thing, but a translation or dubbing script for a film has to be perfect AND it has to match the timing of what's on screen.  As Toshio Suzuki the producer of most of Ghibli's films always told me, his preference would be not to dub the films and make all the audiences learn Japanese. So what do you do? In my experience whatever you do someone will criticize it, and they will not be wrong. Ideally you want to give the audience that doesn't speak Japanese the best possible experience. To do that you can't help but make compromises. Certainly having the budget to take the time to do the whole process right makes a big difference. But as I also say in my book, in the US we don't do a lot of dubbing. In Europe and in Japan everything is dubbed and they have a lot of people with tons of experience who do a fabulous job (I always tell people that I prefer Star Trek in Japanese to Star Trek in English for example. It's better!). Having access to talented and experienced dubbing actors, directors and technicians also makes a big difference.",
