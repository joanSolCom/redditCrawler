A good example is a show I make for Magic the Gathering called Game Knights. My cohost is a really talented trailer editor (Scott Pilgrim, Star Wars TFA) and wanted to make something really high quality in a space that hadn't had it before. As a result, we now watch as so many other channels are putting out higher and higher quality content, even copycats of what we're doing, and to me, it's all groovy. This is a rising tide that floats all ships, and if leading by example is going to result in tons more free and amazing content, I'm all for it.  \n\n\nI hope that VENN's content and our genuine passion for the space is something that inspires gamers, creators, influencers, streamers, and industry vets all around to take part in from a holistic standpoint. I would love for the universal distribution of our network be the thing that kickstarts the career of the next great streamer, or pro gamer, or whatever it might be. Things like VENN have given me the push I needed to keep on my path, so it would be an honor to do the same for others with the same passion -jimmy",
