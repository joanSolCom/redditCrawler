The floor of the nose actually tilts downward, so you need to aim the swab down to get the right angle to get to the nasopharynx.  Thats what we try to teach others, at least.  But, yeah either way, not a very pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in the office we do biopsies in the mouth or throat, or put cameras down people&amp;#39;s nose and throat which can be very uncomfortable unfortunately.

Lastly, my experience with the people that live here has been great, people here are really friendly.\n\nI am sorry to hear of your issues.  When we think about \"throat phlegm\", it is generally caused by two main things: Constant drainage from the nose (from things like allergies or chronic sinus inflammation), or as result of reflux.  The throat will make mucous to neutralize the acids coming from your stomach, and this is usually a significant cause of the problem in many people.  Given your autoimmune history, your mucous may also be thickening up because of the reduced salivation.  Make sure you stay plenty hydrated!\n\nChoosing a good otolaryngologist would be the same for finding any good doctor.  Find someone that listens your problems carefully, is willing to educate you on disease processes/management strategies, and of course, genuinely cares about your ailments.  Best wishes!",

Sometimes, those things can give us headaches so I'm curious if that is causing your problem.  Headaches themselves however, are not suggested to be an indication that your smell is returning.\n\nThere are two main theories on why the distortion of smell occurs. Studies examining COVID patients with MRI scans suggest that the virus directly affects the olfactory nerve bulb, as direct disruption of the smell fibers cause this area to light up on brain scans. Other reports suggest the loss of smell may be conductive (meaning, the odors are not getting to the smell parts of the nose).  This can be from disruption or damage to the tissues that surround the nerves, thereby blocking odors from reaching the nerve endings.
