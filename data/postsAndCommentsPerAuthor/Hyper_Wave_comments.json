Many union spokespeople have made public statements, and at least one lawsuit has been filed (from Florida&amp;#39;s largest teacher union).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I maintained legal counsel in the steps leading up to my decision to resign. I tried everything I could to keep my job under circumstances that would have been safe in terms of preventing spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: As others have correctly pointed out, the Professional Association of Georgia Educators (PAGE) is not actually a union but an advocacy organization. Though it is helpful to teachers, Georgia teachers do not have union membership and can be fired for striking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
